       "  'Advances in technologies for new forms of interactive multimedia services are driving the emergence of a digital world which is transforming all aspects of how people consume and interact with digital content. This emergent digital world is characterised by online access to knowledge resources and services independently from location and time. Here, digital services evolve in response to user behaviour, and technology adapts itself to user needs. As a consequence, new forms of interactive user-centred multimedia services materialise originating in turn new business models and economic growth. These services are underpinned by the confluence of different research fields including knowledge management, data mining, and signal processing. The convergence of these areas is the key to many applications including interactive TV, networked medical imaging, visionbased surveillance, and multimedia visualisation, navigation, search, and retrieval. The latter is a crucial application since the exponential growth of audiovisual data, along with the critical lack of tools to record the data in a well-structured form, is rendering vast portions of available useless content. This special issue reports the work related to the development of innovative paradigms and tools that are driving technological advances and producing new interactive knowledge-assisted multimedia services. After a thorough review process, a total of nine papers were selected. The first three papers address the challenging problem of analysis for annotation and retrieval. In their paper, C.-C. Chiang et al. propose a learning state approach for image retrieval. The authors design a scheme of region-based image representation based on concept units, which are integrated with different types of feature spaces and with different region scales of image segmentation. In the second paper by Q. Zhang and E. Izquierdo, an object-oriented approach for semantic-based image retrieval is presented. The goal is to identify key patterns of specific objects in the training data and to use them as object signatures. Two important aspects of semantic-based image retrieval are considered: retrieval of images containing a given semantic concept and fusion of different low-level features to achieve higher discrimination power in the underlying classification problem. A multiobjective optimisation technique is used to find a suitable multidescriptor space in which several low-level image primitives can be fused. The paper by G. Zaji´cZaji´c et al. describes a content-based image retrieval system with relevance feedback. The approach uses dimensionality reduction. Clustering is achieved by comparison of magnitudes of descriptor components in a query. The next two papers are dedicated to the more specific problem of image classification. G. Papadopoulos et al. combine global and local image information to achieve knowledge-assisted image classification. The proposed learning approach exploits knowledge in the form of ontology. The ontology specifies the domain of interest, its subdomains, the concepts related to each subdomain, as well as contextual information. Support Vector Machines are employed in order to provide image classification to the ontology subdomains based on global image descriptions. In the second paper R. Srikantaswamy and R. Samuel propose a fast and efficient algorithm for segmenting a face suitable for recognition from a video sequence. The cluttered background is first subtracted from each frame, in the foreground regions a coarse face region is found using skin colour. Then using a dynamic template matching approach, the face is efficiently segmented.'),\n",

       "  'Abstract-Purpose: Planning and dosimetry of different VMAT algorithms (SmartArc, Ergo++, Autobeam) is compared with IMRT for Head and Neck Cancer patients. Modelling was performed to rule out the causes of discrepancies between planned and delivered dose. Methods: Five HNC patients previously treated with IMRT were re-planned with SmartArc (SA), Ergo++ and Autobeam. Plans were compared with each other and against IMRT and evaluated using DVHs for PTVs and OARs, delivery time, monitor units (MU) and dosimetric accuracy. Modelling of control point (CP) spacing, Leafend Separation and MLC/Aperture shape was performed to rule out causes of discrepancies between planned and delivered doses. Additionally estimated arc delivery times, overall plan generation times and effect of CP spacing and number of arcs on plan generation times were recorded. Results: Single arc SmartArc plans (SA4d) were generally better than IMRT and double arc plans (SA2Arcs) in terms of homogeneity and target coverage. Double arc plans seemed to have a positive role in achieving improved Conformity Index (CI) and better sparing of some Organs at Risk (OARs) compared to Step and Shoot IMRT (ss-IMRT) and SA4d. Overall Ergo++ plans achieved best CI for both PTVs. Dosimetric validation of all VMAT plans without modelling was found to be lower than ss-IMRT. Total MUs required for delivery were on average 19%, 30%, 10.6% and 6.5% lower than ss-IMRT for SA4d, SA2d (Single arc with 2 0 Gantry Spacing), SA2Arcs and Autobeam plans respectively. Autobeam was most efficient in terms of actual treatment delivery times whereas Ergo++ plans took longest to deliver. Conclusion: Overall SA single arc plans on average achieved best target coverage and homogeneity for both PTVs. SA2Arc plans showed improved CI and some OARs sparing. Very good dosimetric results were achieved with modelling. Ergo++ plans achieved best CI. Autobeam resulted in fastest treatment delivery times.'),\n",

Several existing routing protocols are explained in this paper with aggregation for WSN's are explored. The main objective of this paper provides the importance of secure aggregated routing algorithms for WSN to collect process and aggregate the data from sensors in an energetic conservative manner. Hence the network performance is enhanced. This paper scrutinizes the relationship between aggregation, routing and security issues in WSN. This survey covers a wide range of key issues in routing protocols based on its own evaluation metrics such as throughput, Packet delivery ratio, network lifetime, energy conservation, complexity, scalability and efficiency. In this work, the routing protocols, and its associated parameters are discussed along with the parameters based on the literature survey open research problem and further research directions in the future related to aggregate routing in WSN are discussed.\"),\n",

Firstly, the kinematics parameters analysis of each component of 5-dof parallel mechanism is carried out and kinematics model of 5-dof mechanism is established, mathematical modeling of 5-dof mechanism error then is systematically proposed with integrated modeling method within the identical framework, which constructs the corresponding relationship between end-effector's pose errors and geometric error and clearly discloses the influence of geometric error source on end effector's uncontrollable errors. Finally, by the given the structure parameters, distribution rule of the uncontrollable errors coming from different height of workspace can be figured out with Monte Carlo simulation method, sensitivity analysis can then be carried out to diminish these errors. Error sensitivity represented by the Jacobin matrix shows that ce e is extremely sensitive to 1 b δ . Moreover, in order to obtain the required accuracy, standard. deviation caused by 1 b δ is limited within0.02mm/m, tolerance of 1 b δ should precisely be 0.0449mm. Consequently, uncontrollable errors caused by the UPS chains of the 5-dof parallel tripod head, which can not be compensated by the theoretical method, need more stringent restrictions in manufacturing and assembly stages.\"),\n",

However, current detection techniques, such as Pap smear and colposcopy, fail to achieve a concurrently high sensitivity and specificity. In vivo fluorescence spectroscopy is a technique which quickly, non-invasively and quantitatively probes the biochemical and morphological changes that occur in pre-cancerous tissue. A multivariate statistical algorithm was used to extract clinically useful information from tissue spectra acquired from 361 cervical sites from 95 patients at 337, 380 and 460 nm excitation wavelengths. The multivariate statistical analysis was also employed to reduce the number of fluorescence excitation-emission wavelength pairs required to discriminate healthy tissue samples from pre-cancerous tissue samples. The use of connectionist methods such as multi layered perceptrons, radial basis function networks, and ensembles of such networks was investigated. RBF ensemble algorithms based on fluorescence spectra potentially provide automated, and near real-time implementation of pre-cancer detection in the hands of non-experts. The results are more reliable, direct and accurate than those achieved by either human experts or multivariate statistical algorithms.'),\n",

One of the conventional methods is to link users' focus of attention to their performance undertaken in a video. However, this is not always true in a video environment, as users' poor performance may be resulted from some other reasons rather than a lack of focus of attention. In this article, we demonstrated our assumption by using an Electroencephalography (EEG) sensor, which measured the users' attention level in a video task. Our results showed one case that some of the users with a poor performance in the video task had the same level of attention compared to those users with a good performance. In particular, an interference object in the video, aimed for distracting the users' attention, had no impact on some of the users' focus when they were already involved in the video task.\"),\n",

KLM-FA can support various evaluation scenarios, both in a formative and summative context, and according to different interaction strategies or modeled users' characteristics. A study investigated the accuracy of KLM-FA predictions by comparing them to participants' execution times for six form filling tasks in popular social networking websites. The tool produced highly accurate predictions (89.1% agreement with user data) in an efficient manner.\"),\n",

In this paper, tracking tests of the human-robot system using an impedance-controlled robot are performed in order to clarify the control ability of human operators, and changes of the tracking ability and the dynamic property of the human operator are analyzed for different values of the robot impedance. From the experimental results, it is shown that the human operator tries to keep the dynamic property of the overall system as constant as possible by adjusting his or her own impedance property.

       "  'Abstract This paper is concerned with the problem of learning a distance metric by considering meaningful and discriminative distance constraints in some contexts where rich information between data is provided. Classic metric learning approaches focus on constraints that involve pairs or triplets of images. We propose a general Mahalanobis-like distance metric learning framework that exploits distance constraints over up to four different images. We show how the integration of such constraints can lead to unsupervised or semi-supervised learning tasks in some applications. We also show the benefit on recognition performance of this type of constraints, in rich contexts such as relative attributes, class taxonomies and temporal webpage analysis.'),\n",

       "  'Abstract: In this paper, a new 2D-DOST (Two-Dimensional Discrete Orthonormal Stockwell Transform) and LS-SVM (Least Squares Support Vector Machines) based classifier system is proposed for classification of texture images. The proposed system contains two main stages. These stages are feature extraction and classification. In the feature extraction stage, the distinguishing feature vectors which represent descriptive features of texture images are obtained by using a 2D-DOST based feature extraction method. In the classification stage, the texture images are classified by the LS-SVM since this classifier has high success rate and accuracy. The training of LS-SVM is performed on the distinguishing feature vector of each texture component. Texture samples are recognized by the test data applied to the input of trained LS-SVM classifier. Performance evaluations of the proposed method are carried on different datasets obtained from sub-images. These datasets include both the normal texture images and noise added images. Sub-images into datasets are derived from Brodatz and Kylberg texture images database. Gaussian and Salt & Pepper noise with different levels are used for creating noisy datasets. According to the study results, the proposed 2D-DOST and LS-SVM based classifier has a capability of classifying texture images with high success rate and noise robustness. 2D-DOST Özellik Çıkarımı Yöntemi ve LS-SVM Sınıflandırıcı Tabanlı Doku Sınıflandırma'),\n",

Experts in a given field can establish a set of rules for the proper functioning of a manufacturing process or even acompany, facilitating the decision-making process. However, whenever the scenario changes and new rules need to be incorporated into the rule set, or old rules need to be deleted or modified, the manager may find it difficult to reformulate this set of rules. An adaptive mechanism that facilitates the modification of the set of rules is fundamental to assist the manager in making decisions. The Adaptive Color Petri Net is a tool that enables the modification of the set of rules, transforming the IF-THEN rule format used by anauxiliary Extended Adaptive Decision Table in an equivalent ACPN subnet.'),\n",
