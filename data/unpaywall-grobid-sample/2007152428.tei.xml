<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Kuntscher's nails for femoral fractures SIR,-I was very sorry to read that Tony Harrold had died. I knew him well as the first secretary of the University Hospitals Association. I had met him since professionally and admired him very much.</p><p>I would, however, like to make certain points about the technique described in his article on Kuntscher's nails for femoral fractures <ref type="bibr">(20 November, p 1446)</ref>. I have always used the open technique. I have never seen the point (and nor did the late Kenneth Pridie) of putting the patient to the trauma and the surgeon to the trouble of knocking the nail up in the proximal fragment and then knocking it down again. I have always reamed the upper fragment to its maximum (except for the great trochanter itself which is reamed two sizes smaller), passed the guide wire up through the proximal fragment into the buttock, cut down on this, and then inserted the nail from above over the guide wire. For most of my 31 years in the National Health Service I have used this method, and only once did the nail become fixed in the upper fragment through an error on my part. This method is less traumatic for the patient, less energetic for the surgeon, and seems logical.</p><p>Secondly, I have never used mechanical reamers, which can overheat and then thin the bone too much, leading to necrosis and delayed union. For years I have used Mason Master wallbits 30 cm long, of appropriate diameters, with their ends squared so as to fit into a standard carpenter's brace. These cut the bone well, the mechanical advantage is excellent, and they do not overheat the bone. The reaming is almost straight as opposed to that produced by the flexible mechanical reamer. The method is cheap and much safer and more effective than mechanical reaming or the old fashioned "cobra headed" hand reamers. Over-reaming is impossible.</p><p>Finally, the incidence of complications with this method in my hands has been very low. intramedullary nail. This is made of much thinner stainless steel than the Kuntscher nail, and has a cross section which is approximately an incomplete circle with a narrow slot posteriorly. This makes it sufficiently elastic in the transverse plane to grip the bone, which the rigid Kuntscher nail does not do. After reaming the femoral shaft to the size of the nail with graduated flexible reamers the AO nail is inserted in anterograde fashion through a hole made in the outer cortex of the great trochanter. Rotational displacement rarely occurs after fixation with this nail, and, because of the method of insertion, the proximal migration referred to by Mr Harrold with Kuntscher nailing, which causes the nail to project into the buttock, does not occur.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>M P MCCORMACK</head><p>I was glad to see that Mr Harrold questioned the need for routine removal of metallic devices used for internal fixation of fractures. This adds considerably to waiting lists and the costs of fracture treatment, and in the case of deeply placed appliances such as plates on the radius or femur may add appreciably to the morbidity. Each case needs to be carefully assessed on its merits to decide whether removal of the device is really necessary.</p><p>B Coronary care in a general practitioner hospital SIR,-We are second to none in our admiration for the work of Dr Arwyn Davies (20 November, p 1469), not least because of the perspective it gives to the letters of Professor Peter Sleight (p 1500) and Dr J E U Moxan and Dr D R Lockstone (p 1503). At the same time the argument for the system described rests much more on the satisfaction given to the doctors concerned and more importantly to the patient-whose pride in his local hospital is rightly considerable-than on the alleged remoteness and facilities of the nearest district general hospital. The A40 trunk road is rarely blocked, and a journey time of 30 minutes if not ideal compares well with that for many patients in less rural areas. His district general hospital, if without a coronary care unit, does have a specific allocation of coronary care beds within its intensive therapy unit with facilities for temporary transvenous pacing, echocardiography, etc.</p><p>Dr Davies's conclusion that such a system should be set up in community hospitals is also overstated and unsupported by his data. It is not possible to extrapolate from the experience of a single practice-where one partner has special experience and an interest in coronary disease and four of whose members hold higher qualifications-to all others. With many general practitioner training schemes containing no unit of general (internal) medicine it cannot be assumed that most entrants to general practice will be familiar with the techniques of hospital care in</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" validated="false"><head>Bristol BS8 IBA</head><label>BS8</label><figDesc>SIR,-This morning while idly turning the pages of this week's BMJ I came across an article by the late Mr A J Harrold on the subject of Kuntscher's nails for femoral fractures (20 November, p 1446). This sent my mind rushing back to the spring of 1946. At that time I was the resident medical officer to the 5th Royal Tank Regiment, my previous regiment the 44th Royal Tank Regiment having been disbanded. I had had a fragment of metal which I had received by courtesy of the Royal Air Force in Normandy successfully removed from the tissue overlying my right clavicle by a certain Dr Gunter of Wilster, where I was stationed at the time. In return he had asked me to take him to the hospital at Schleswig to see his old friend Professor Kuntscher. This was all very difficult since it was still in the days of non-fraternisation. No matter, what was wrong with a doctor speaking to another doctor ? I managed to persuade my tank colonel to allow me the use of his staff car to attend an important medical meeting. The next day the commanding officer's driver collected both Dr Gunter and myself for the long trip to Schleswig. I still remember that Dr Gunter had only some black bread to sustain him. I offered him my ration of white bread and cheese but he refused to take it. When we arrived at the hospital in Schleswig I was introduced to Professor Kuntscher. He invited me into the hospital wards where he had carried out his intramedullary surgery. With all the patients standing to attention I carried out the usual inspection. At that time I was a mere captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps and so felt particularly thrilled at this honour. Later Professor Kuntscher took me into his office and presented me with all his intramedullary nailing instruments-not just for the femur-</figDesc><table>I still have them.

SIR,-In his leading article (20 November, 
p 1446) the late Mr A J Harrold outlined the 
advantages of intramedullary nail fixation for 
some fractures of the femoral shaft. He stated 
that the resulting fixation is much stronger 
than that obtained by plates and screws, and 
so far as angulation in the longitudinal plane 
is concerned this is true. A Kuntscher nail, 
however, gives no control over rotation at the 
fracture site, and it is a common experience 
that fractures treated by this method can end 
up with union in a considerable degree of 
external rotation of the distal fragment. 
This difficulty can be overcome by using 
the AO (Association for Osteosynthesis)
