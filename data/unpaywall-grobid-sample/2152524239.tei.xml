<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract</head><p>The mortality related to cervical cancer can be substantially reduced through early detection and treatment. However, current detection techniques, such as Pap smear and colposcopy, fail to achieve a concurrently high sensitivity and specificity. In vivo fluorescence spectroscopy is a technique which quickly, non-invasively and quantitatively probes the biochemical and morphological changes that occur in pre-cancerous tissue. A multivariate statistical algorithm was used to extract clinically useful information from tissue spectra acquired from 361 cervical sites from 95 patients at 337, 380 and 460 nm excitation wavelengths. The multivariate statistical analysis was also employed to reduce the number of fluorescence excitation-emission wavelength pairs required to discriminate healthy tissue samples from pre-cancerous tissue samples. The use of connectionist methods such as multi layered perceptrons, radial basis function networks, and ensembles of such networks was investigated. RBF ensemble algorithms based on fluorescence spectra potentially provide automated, and near real-time implementation of pre-cancer detection in the hands of non-experts. The results are more reliable, direct and accurate than those achieved by either human experts or multivariate statistical algorithms.</p></div>

The connectionist methods aim at improving the classification accuracy and reliability of the MSA, as well as simplifying the decision making process.

Data acquisition, calibration and processing have been described in detail elsewhere ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ramanujam et al., 1996)</ref>.</p><p>A randomly selected group of non-pregnant patients referred to the colposcopy clinic of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center on the basis of abnormal cervical cytology was asked to participate in the in vivo fluorescence spectroscopy study. Informed consent was obtained from each patient who participated and the study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the University of Texas, Austin and the University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center.</p><p>Each patient underwent a complete history and a physical examination including a pelvic exam, a Pap smear and colposcopy of the cervix, vagina and vulva. After colposcopic examination of the cervix, but before tissue biopsy, fluorescence spectra were acquired on average from two colposcopically abnormal sites, two colposcopically normal squamous sites and 1 normal columnar site (if colposcopically visible) from each patient, from a total of 361 cervical sites in 95 patients.</p><p>Tissue biopsies were obtained only from abnormal sites identified by colposcopy and subsequently analyzed by the probe to comply with routine patient care procedure. All tissue biopsies were fixed in formalin and submitted for histologic examination. Hemotoxylin and eosin stained sections of each biopsy specimen were evaluated by a panel of four board certified pathologists and a consensus diagnosis was established using the Bethesda classification system <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Wright et al., 1994)</ref>. This classification system which has previously been used to grade cytologic specimens has now been extended to classification of histology samples. Samples were classified as normal squamous (NS), normal columnar (NC), inflammation 3 , low grade (LG) SIL and high grade (HG) SIL. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> provides the number of samples in the training (calibration) and test (prediction) sets.</p></div>

All fluorescence intensities are reported in the same set of calibrated units.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Full-Parameter Multivariate Statistical Algorithm</head><p>The Multivariate Statistical Algorithm (MSA) development described in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ramanujam et al., 1996)</ref> consists of the following five steps:</p><p>1. pre-processing to reduce inter-patient and intra-patient variation of fluorescence spectra from a tissue type, using either normalization or normalization followed by meanscaling,</p><p>2. dimension reduction of the pre-processed tissue fluorescence spectra using Principal Component Analysis (PCA),</p><p>3. selection of diagnostically relevant principal components, using an unpaired, one-sided student's t-test, 4. development of a classification algorithm based on logistic discrimination, using the diagnostically relevant principal components, and finally 5. retrospective and prospective evaluation of the algorithm's accuracy on a training and test set, respectively.</p><p>unkown tissue sample This process of algorithm development was applied to tissue fluorescence spectra acquired at all three excitation wavelengths, as described in detail in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ramanujam et al., 1996)</ref>. Discrimination between the SILs and the two normal tissue types was achieved using a composite algorithm of two independently developed constituent algorithms. Constituent algorithm (1), which is based on tissue spectra that have been pre-processed by normalization, discriminates between SILs and normal squamous tissue samples. Constituent algorithm (2), which is based on tissue spectra that have been pre-processed by normalization followed by mean-scaling, discriminate between SILs and normal columnar tissue samples. The classification outputs from both constituent algorithms were used to determine whether a sample being evaluated is SIL/non-SIL. A sample is first presented to constituent algorithm (1). If it is classified as non-SIL, the algorithm terminates. If it is classified as SIL, then the sample is presented to constituent algorithm <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref>, and the result of that algorithm determines the final classification of the tissue sample. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref> illustrates this procedure.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">✲ algo (1) ✒ ❅ ❅ ❅ | non-SIL ✓ ✒ ✏ ✑ possible SIL ✲ algo (2) ✒ ❅ ❅ ❅ | non-SIL ✓ ✒ ✏ ✑ SIL ✓ ✒ ✏ ✑</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Reduced-Parameter Multivariate Statistical Algorithms</head><p>The full-parameter MSA utilizes fluorescence spectra at all three excitation wavelengths to develop a classification scheme for cervical pre-cancer detection; the fluorescence spectra at these three excitation wavelengths correspond to fluorescence intensities at a total of 160 excitation-emission wavelength pairs (5 nm spectral resolution). However, there is a significant cost penalty for using all 160 values. To alleviate this concern, a more cost-effective fluorescence imaging system can be developed if the number of required excitation-emission wavelength pairs at which fluorescence intensities need to be recorded is significantly reduced. For example, if the number of required excitation-emission wavelength pairs that need to measured can be reduced by an order of magnitude, the polychromator and intensified diode array can be replaced by a mechanical filter assembly and a single channel detector. The resulting system represents a substantial decrease in cost and complexity of this instrumentation.</p><p>We have shown that component loadings calculated from Principal Component Analysis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ramanujam et al., 1996)</ref> can be used to reduce the number of fluorescence excitationemission wavelength pairs required to generate the constituent algorithms from 160 to 13, with a minimal decrease in classification accuracy. The component loadings represent the correlation between a principal component and the pre-processed fluorescence spectra at each excitation-emission wavelength pair. More precisely, the diagnostically relevant principal components of the full-parameter set (160 variables) selected using the students t-test are used to calculate the component loadings. The intensity/wavelength pairs that show a strong correlation to the relevant principal components form the reduced-parameter set. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows the fluorescence intensities at the reduced number of excitation-emission wavelength pairs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Algorithms Based on Neural Networks</head><p>The second stage of algorithm development consists of evaluating the applicability of neural networks to this problem. For this study, we consider two types of feed forward neural networks, the Multi-Layered Perceptron (MLP) and the Radial Basis function (RBF) network ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Tumer et al., 1997</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Multi-Layered Perceptrons</head><p>The MLP, probably the most commonly used neural network architecture, is a feed-forward neural network with an input layer, an output layer and possibly multiple hidden layers. Each layer is connected only to the subsequent layer by variable weights which are adjusted to minimize a predetermined cost function, such as the Mean Square Error (MSE). For an MLP with one hidden layer, the responses of the kth hidden unit, h k , and the jth output, o j , are respectively given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">h k = g( i v ki x i );<label>(1)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">o j = f ( k w jk h k ),<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where the input to hidden connections strength are given by v, the hidden to output connection strengths are given by w, and indices i and k sum over the input (x) and hidden units respectively. The activation functions f (·) and g(·) are sigmoidal functions.</p><p>In order to adapt the weights, the backpropagation algorithm is generally used. The principle of this algorithm is based on distributing the "blame" or the contribution of each unit to the overall error, across the proper weights. Further details can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Haykin, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bishop, 1995)</ref>. In this study we only explore MLPs with a single hidden layer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Radial Basis Function Networks</head><p>Radial Basis Function networks are feed-forward networks with a single hidden layer where the activation function is a radially symmetric basis function. The output units perform a weighted sum over the outputs of the hidden units (also called kernels). One class of radial basis functions that is of particular interest consists of those with Gaussian kernels, or where the basis', (R j (x)), have the following activation function <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Haykin, 1994)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">R j (x) = e − 1 2 x−x j 2 σ 2 j ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where σ j determines the width of the receptive field, and x j determines the centroid of the jth kernel, respectively. The jth hidden node has a maximum output of 1 when input x = x j . Important parameters in the design of RBF networks include the number, location and receptive field widths of the kernels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Combining Multiple Networks</head><p>The performance of a given MLP or RBF network depends on many parameters, including size, learning rate, training strategy and initial weights. These differences result in different classification decisions, making the selection of a single "best" network a delicate matter. This problem is further compounded when the amount of training patterns is limited, because the definition of "best" depends on the particular validation set chosen. In such cases, it is difficult to ascertain whether one network will outperform all others given a different test set, as the validation sets are small. Furthermore, selecting only one classifier discards a large amount of potentially relevant information. In order to use all the available data, and to increase both the performance and the reliability of the methods, one can pool the outputs of the individual classifiers before a classification decision is made <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Hampshire and Waibel, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hansen and Salamon, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Perrone and Cooper, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Tumer and Ghosh, 1996a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Wolpert, 1992)</ref>.</p><p>In this study we use the median combiner, f med i , which belongs to the class of order statistics combiners introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Tumer and Ghosh, 1995)</ref>, and the averaging combiner, f ave i which performs an arithmetic average of the corresponding outputs:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">f med i (x) =      f N 2 :N i (x) + f N 2 +1:N i (x) 2 if N is even f N+1 2 :N i (x) if N is odd,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">f ave i (x) = 1 N N m=1 f m i (x),<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where N represents the number of available classifiers, and f m i (x) the ith output of the mth classifier for input x. We selected these two combiners, because of their simplicity in both interpretation and implementation, and because they typically result in good and robust performance ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kittler et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Tumer and Ghosh, 1995</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results</head><p>In this section we discuss the application of various neural network based algorithms to the spectral data discussed in Section 2. In order to establish the validity of using the neural network ensembles to perform this task, we conducted the following sets of experiments:</p><p>1. To evaluate the suitability of the neural network methods, we re-developed constituent algorithms (1) and (2) with the RBF and MLP ensembles using:</p><p>(a) the full-parameter, pre-processed data sets;</p><p>(b) the diagnostically relevant principal components obtained from the full-parameter, pre-processed data sets;</p><p>(c) the reduced-parameter, pre-processed data sets.</p><p>2. Reduce the two-step algorithm developed using MSA into a single-step algorithm using RBF and/or MLP ensembles.</p><p>3. Produce full comparative results showing the neural network ensembles' classification accuracy and reliability relative to the MSA, Pap smear and colposcopy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Neural Network Ensembles on Full-Parameter Set</head><p>The first step in applying the neural network ensembles to this problem consisted of determining whether the algorithms were suited for this task. To that end, both the MLP and RBF ensembles were used to separate the normal squamous tissues from the SILs (constituent algorithm (1)). The task proved to be impossible using the full 160 parameters mainly because of the small number of training samples. Constraining the number of weights required to handle 160 parameters with the available data resulted in a highly ill-posed problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Wahba, 1982)</ref>. As a result the network tried to memorize the training data and performed poorly on the test set. In order to avoid this pitfall, we used the three diagnostically relevant principal components from the full-parameter data set containing normalized fluorescence spectra. (Note, the MSA was developed using these same three PCs, because it also was unable to solve this problem using the full-parameter data.) Both networks had two outputs, each representing the posterior probabilities of the corresponding class. The MLP networks had a single hidden layer with three hidden units, and the RBF networks had three kernels which were initialized by a k-means algorithm on the training set 4 .</p><p>The ensemble results reported in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> correspond to the pooling of 20 different classifiers (MLPs or RBFs), each of which started from a different random weight initializations, using the average and median combiners, respectively 5 . All the results reported in this article are based on test set performance. We report the sensitivity and specificity values separately, rather than a single classification rate, to emphasize the difference between a false-positive and a false-negative. For an application such as pre-cancer detection, the cost of a misclassification varies greatly from one class to another. Erroneously labeling a healthy tissue as pre-cancerous can be corrected when further tests are performed. Labeling a pre-cancerous tissue as healthy however, can lead to disastrous consequences. Therefore, for algorithm (1), we increased the cost of a misclassified SIL until the sensitivity 6 reached a satisfactory level (comparable to the sensitivity of current clinical detection).</p><p>For this experiment, the RBF based combiners provide higher specificity than either the MLP ensembles or the MSA, for a similar sensitivity. This experiment was conducted to ensure that neural network ensembles could duplicate the MSA results <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Ramanujam et al., 1996)</ref>, using the principal components extracted from the full-parameter set. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Accuracy of constituent algorithm (1) for differentiating between SILs and normal squamous tissues, based on the diagnostically relevant principal components of the fullparameter set containing normalized spectra.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Neural Networks on Reduced-Parameter Set (2-step Algorithm)</head><p>The second step in applying neural networks to this problem consisted of determining whether the neural network ensemble performance on the reduced-parameter data set was acceptable, by retracing the development of the two-step process outlined for the multivariate statistical algorithm. Specifically, the neural network ensemble was applied to the pre-processed reduced-parameter data sets, used to develop constituent algorithms (1) and (2).</p><p>For constituent algorithm (1) the RBF kernels were initialized using a k-means clustering algorithm on the training set containing normal squamous tissue samples and SILs. The RBF networks had 10 kernels, whose locations and spreads were adjusted during training. The MLP had one hidden layer with 10 hidden units. For constituent algorithm (2), we selected 10 kernels, half of which were fixed to patterns from the columnar normal class, while the other half were initialized using a k-means algorithm. Neither the kernel locations nor their spreads were adjusted during training. This process was adopted to rectify the large discrepancy between the number of samples from each category (13 for columnar normal vs. 58 for SILs). In this case, the MLP algorithm had 10 hidden units. Training was shypothesizetopped when the performance on the training set slowed down sufficiently to suggest further training would cause overtraining <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Once a stopping time was selected, 20 cases were run for each algorithm 8 . <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Accuracy of constituent algorithm (1) for differentiating SILs and normal squamous tissues, based on the reduced-parameter set containing normalized spectra.</p></div>

Once again we increased the cost of misclassifying a SIL in order to increase the sensitivity at the expense of reducing the specificity. For algorithm (1), the cost of a misclassified SIL was 2.5 times the cost of a misclassified normal tissue sample. The sensitivity and specificity values for constituent algorithm (1) based on MSA, MLP and RBF ensembles are provided in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>. <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> presents sensitivity and specificity values for constituent algorithm (2) obtained from MSA, and MLP and RBF ensembles. In this case, there was no need to increase the cost of a misclassified SIL for the RBF network, because of the high prominence of SILs in the training set. For the MLPs however, the cost of normal columnars had to be increased in order to obtain classification decisions 9 .</p><p>For both algorithms (1) and (2), the RBF based combiners provide higher specificity than the MSA, while the MLP ensemble does so only for algorithm <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref>. Furthermore in the case of the RBF algorithm, this increase is achieved without a decrease in the sensitivity. The median combiner provides results similar to those of the average combiner, except for algorithm (2) where it provides better specificity. From these experiments we can conclude that the RBF network is better suited for this task than the MLP. While in some other work such as classification of sonar signals we have found combining MLPs with RBFs to be fruitful ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ghosh et al., 1996)</ref>, in this problem we were surprised to find that combining MLPs and RBFs always gave worse results than combining RBFs alone. We hypothesize that the fine tuning required to accommodate the varying number of class samples poses severe problems for MLPs global computations. The RBF networks significantly alleviate this problem by placing the kernels in the appropriate places.</p><p>We conducted this experiment to not only to demonstrate that the reduced-parameter data set does not compromise the performance of the network ensembles, but also to compare the RBF and MLP ensembles. having established the validity of the reduced-parameter set, we performed the remaining experiments on the reduced-parameter data set only. This is a significant step, since it allows us to solely depend on the 13 parameters obtained from the component loadings, rather than on the principal components from the original 160 values. Furthermore, the results of the first two steps indicate that the RBF network ensembles not only duplicate and surpass the MSA results, but also outperform the MLP algorithms at every step. Since the MLP ensembles fail to show any areas where they may be more desirable than the RBF network ensembles, we will restrict the remainder of the experiments to RBF network ensembles only.</p><p>In Sections 4.1 and 4.2, we used the two constituent algorithms separately, to discriminate different types of normal tissue from SILs. In order to obtain the final discrimination between normal tissue and SILs, constituent algorithms (1) and (2) need to be used sequentially. This two step approach, highlighted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>, was specifically developed for the multivariate statistical analysis, which performed best when the decision tasks were simplified. In the next section we present a more direct approach that uses the strengths of the neural network ensembles to reduce the multi-step classification scheme to a direct, one-step, process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Single Step Classification using Reduced-Parameter Set</head><p>In this section, we examine the potential of RBF ensembles for separating SILs from normal tissue samples in a single classification step. Because the pre-processing for algorithms (1) and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(2)</ref> is different 10 , we formed 26-dimensional inputs by concatenating the two reduced features sets describes in Section 3.1.2. We initialized 10 kernels using a k-means algorithm on a trimmed 11 version of the training set. Without this trimming process, few patterns belonging to the columnar normal class are selected as kernels due to their low prominence in the training set, resulting in poor performance when such a sample is seen. During training, the kernel locations and spreads were not adjusted, to allow kernels to remain in sections of the input space where few patterns are observed. The cost of a misclassified SIL was set at 2.5 times the cost of a misclassified normal tissue sample, in order to provide the best sensitivity/specificity pair. The average and median combiner results are obtained by pooling 20 RBF networks 12 . </p></div>

For comparison purposes, the results of the 2-step RBF ensemble algorithms are also provided. These algorithms perform the same steps as the MSA, using the results presented in Section 3.1.2 for each constituent algorithm).</p><p>As we discussed above, for an application such as pre-cancer detection, it is far more critical to increase the classification accuracy of some classes than others, to eliminate certain types of errors. By making the algorithm more compact, the one step algorithm also makes this trade-off more visible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">Sensitivity-Specificity Tradeoff</head><p>In this subsection we detail the interaction between the cost of misclassification and the variation in the sensitivity/specificity of the RBF ensembles. Since it may be required to reach a predetermined sensitivity, we have varied the cost of misclassifying a SIL to obtain a wide range of sensitivity/specificity pairs. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 7</ref> shows the specificity and sensitivity for various costs of a misclassification.</p><p>On observing the performance of the RBF ensembles at various costs of misclassifying SILs, the improvements over the two-step MSA algorithm are apparent. If the specificity is required to be above 60%, for example, using a SIL misclassification cost of three improves the sensitivity of the MSA by a significant 10%, using the average RBF ensembles. If, on the other hand, a sensitivity above 83% is required, using a SIL misclassification cost of two, provides an improvement of 12% over the specificity of the MSA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Comparative Results</head><p>In the previous sections we discussed how the neural network ensembles were applied to various stages of this classification tasks. In this section we compare the final results of the RBF network ensembles to the best MSA result and to clinical methods. The SIL misclassification cost of 2.5 provided the best compromise between sensitivity and specificity. To find the variability of the methods, we performed the ensemble averaging 10 times on 20 different individual classifiers.</p><p>The results of both the two-step and one-step RBF algorithms and the results of the two-step MSA are compared to the accuracy of Pap smear screening and colposcopy in expert hands in <ref type="table">Table 8</ref>. A comparison of one-step RBF algorithms to the two-step RBF algorithms indicates that the one-step algorithms have similar specificities, but a moderate improvement in sensitivity relative to the two-step algorithms. Compared to the MSA, the one-step RBF algorithms have a slightly decreased specificity, but a substantially improved sensitivity. In addition to the improved sensitivity, the one step RBF algorithms simplify the decision making process. A comparison between the one step RBF algorithms and Pap smear screening indicates that the RBF algorithms have a nearly 30% improvement in sensitivity with no compromise in specificity; when compared to colposcopy in expert hands <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Fahey et al., 1995)</ref>, the RBF ensemble algorithms maintain the sensitivity of expert colposcopists, while improving the specificity by almost 20%. <ref type="table">Table 8</ref>: One step RBF algorithm compared to multi-step MSA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ramanujam et al., 1996)</ref> and clinical methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Fahey et al., 1995)</ref> for differentiating SILs and normal tissue samples.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion</head><p>In this article we demonstrate that cervical tissue fluorescence spectra can be used to develop detection algorithms that differentiate SILs from normal tissue samples. Of the various algorithms explored, the RBF network ensemble proved to be the best alternative, surpassing single networks, MLP ensembles, and the multivariate statistical algorithm.</p><p>The classification results of both the multivariate statistical algorithms and the radial basis function network ensembles demonstrate that significant improvement in classification accuracy can be achieved over current clinical detection modalities using cervical tissue spectral data obtained from in vivo fluorescence spectroscopy. The one-step RBF algorithm has the potential to significantly reduce the number of pre-cancerous cases missed by Pap smear screening and the number of normal tissues misdiagnosed by expert colposcopists.</p><p>The qualitative nature of current clinical detection modalities leads to a significant variability in classification accuracy. For example, estimates of the sensitivity and specificity of Pap smear screening have been shown to range from 11-99% and 14-97%, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Fahey et al., 1995)</ref>. This limitation can be addressed by exploiting the variance reducing properties of an ensemble approach. In particular, RBF ensembles demonstrate a significantly Figure 5: Trade-off between sensitivity and specifity for MSA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ramanujam et al., 1996)</ref> and RBF ensembles. For reference, Pap smear and colposcopy results from the literature on various data sets are included <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Fahey et al., 1995</ref>).</p><p>smaller variability in classification accuracy, therefore enabling more reliable classification. In addition to demonstrating a superior sensitivity, the RBF ensembles simplify the decision making process of the two-step algorithms based on RBF and MSA into a single step that discriminates between SILs and normal tissues. We note that for the given data set, both MSA and MLP were unable to provide satisfactory solutions in one step.</p><p>The one-step algorithm development process can be readily implemented in software, enabling automated detection of cervical pre-cancer. It can potentially provide near real time implementation of pre-cancer detection in the hands of non-experts, and could lead to wide-scale implementation of screening and diagnosis, and more effective patient management in the prevention of cervical cancer. The success of this application will represent an important step forward in both medical laser spectroscopy and gynecologic oncology.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :Figure 2 :</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Fluorecsence spectra from a typical patient at 337 nm excitation.350.0 450.0 550.0 650.0 Wavelength (nm) 0.00 0.10 0.20 0.30 Fluorescence Intensity NC NS HG LG Figure 2: Fluorecsence spectra from a typical patient at 380 nm excitation.</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="1"> Sensitivity is the correct classification percentage on the pre-cancerous tissue samples. 2 Specificity is the correct classification percentage on normal tissue samples.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> In this paper we will not focus on the classification of tissues with inflammation. Evaluation of these tissues using both MSA and neural networks indicates that they are nearly indistinguishable from SILs based on the spectral data presented here (Ramanujam et al., 1995a; Ramanujam et al., 1995b). To remedy the situation, different optical spectroscopic techniques are needed.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="4"> The appropriate sizes of both the MLP and the RBF network were determined experimentally. Because we found that the performance was comparable over fairly large range of network sizes, it was not necessary to use sophisticated methods. 5 The gains due to combining were minimal if more classifiers were used. 6 In the results reported in this section, the cost of misclassifying a SIL was two times the cost of misclassifying a normal tissue sample.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="7"> In general, Leave-One-Out or K-fold cross validation woudl be more desirable. However, because the results were similar over a large window of stopping times, this more naive method seemed adequate. 8 Each run has a different initialial set of kernels/spreads/weights.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="9"> When the cost of a misclassified SIL was the same as the cost of a misclassified normal columnar, all patterns were classified as SILs by the MLP. Only when the cost of normal columnars was increased did the MLP start to make non-trivial classification decisions.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="10"> Normalization vs. normalization followed by mean scaling.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="11"> The trimmed set has the same number of patterns from each class. Thus, it forces each class to have a similar number of kernels. This set is used only for initializing the kernels, not while training. 12 This procedure is repeated 10 times, in order to determine the variability in the ensembles.</note>
