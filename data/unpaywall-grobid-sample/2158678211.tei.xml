<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ABSTRACT</head><p>Extracting information from the huge time series is a challenging task. Databases are prepared by keeping in mind the type of information required. Indexing a time series is a difficult task, where shape may not be exact. Finding the minima and maxima of the time series is another difficult job dependent on the expert's subjectivity. In this information age algorithmic trading is the buzz word. For the identification of various patterns, a machine can be made intelligent by embedding some good algorithm in the trading module to identify the various patterns. In this paper an attempt has been made to identify the extremes, where profit probability is maximized.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>A time sequence is a sequence of values produced by a process. All these values obtained from a particular process have a time stamp. Sampling frequency is decided on the basis of change in the values of time stamp. Time series are ordered by time hence all the values obtained by a process must be preserved on the time basis. Time series databases are prepared in keeping the mind whether the query on the time series will be of shape based or value based .Objective of shape query is to find the shapes from the time series whose shape is similar to the training data set shape. Mammoth size time series makes it difficult to extract information from the data; hence important features are extracted so that information is not lost. Feature extracted from the time series is dependent on the types query to be made on the time series. Searching may be approximate. Discrete fourier transformation is the common method in which signal is viewed as a frequency domain instead of values by keeping the few frequency components where as noise and irrelevant attributes are dropped. In features extraction using times derivatives, the difference of signal values with the point and the next point values, this value is then mapped to a symbol from an alphabet. This alphabet is called a shape description alphabet. A signal described as a symbol string will have an envelope and all signals within that envelope will match that same symbol string <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Table1. Example of a shape description alphabet <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p></div>

First derivative of any function can be interpreted as the rate of change of signal where as the second derivative is the rate of change of slope or curvature <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Principal component analysis is a good candidate of essential features extraction methods. All components having Eigen values greater than one are considered essential and rest are dropped without losing the essential information <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In features extraction using polynomial, A sequence is broken into numerous segments and each segment is approximated with a signal. In first degree of approximation start trend, end trend, slope and constant are identified to form the equation y= mx +b. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Researcher's interest remains in the time series data mining task of indexing, clustering, classification, summarization and anomaly detection. Indexing is finding the most similar time series using some similar or dissimilar measure. Clustering a time series is grouping on some similarity distance measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Classification is assigning a time series to a predefined class <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Summarization is the keeping the essential features without destroying the information <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.Various methods of features extraction have been discussed above. Anomaly detection is the finding of all surprising, unexpected behavior in the time series which deviates from the normal behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Rest of the paper is organized as follows Section2 covers symbolic time series representation.</p><p>Section3 covers discrete fourier transformation.</p><p>Section4 covers proposed model.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">SYMBOLIC TIME SERIES REPRESENTATION [5]</head><p>A Symbolic aggregate approximation is one of the method of symbolic time series representation, ideally suited for the time series where lower bounding of the distance is required. SAX representation is taking a real valued signal and that signal is distributed among the various sections as displayed in <ref type="figure">fig. 1</ref>. By substituting each section with its mean a reduced dimensionality, piece wise constant approximation is obtained. For a long time series, A single SAX word is not obtained but a shorter window or feature window is obtained <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>.Sax representation is a discrete time series representation and chaos game bitmap representation can be used for visualizing discrete sequence. SAX has the potential to build word of any size but it has been found out that cardinality of four is best <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Initial ordering of four SAX symbols are obtained as given in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Frequencies of the subsequences are counted from the SAX words. Streams are not mixed in order to count the frequency of sub words. Once the raw count of sub word of desired length have been obtained and recorded in the pixels, then normalization is done by dividing the every number in cells by the largest number. Colors are identified from Zero to one and values in the cells are mapped with a color and the time series takes the form of a bitmap. Anomaly detection is done by the creation of two windows lag window and the lead window. Lead window looks ahead in the time series for anomalous pattern. Lag window size is determined by the fact that the how much memory of the past is required. Each window bitmap is generated using the SAX representation. Distance between two bitmap is measured and as reported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">DISCRTE FOURIER TRANSFORMATION.</head><p>Discrete fourier transformation is the projection of a time signal from time domain into frequency domain and can be given by equation 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Eq. 1</head><p>Where f= 1 ,2… n, and i= C f are complex numbers and represent the amplitudes and shifts of a decomposition of signal into sinusoidal functions. It measures global frequencies and assumes to be periodic. Fast fourier algorithm has the time complexity O(n log n) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>. If the problem is to index the collection of smaller sequences, discrete transformation is applied to each sequence and two to four components are selected to represent the entire sequence. These components are our feature factor. Since very little information is extracted hence compression will be easier and the pattern will be matched easily. For finding the sequences from the large sequences a sliding window of length n is selected. Initially window is placed over the first n values of the time series. The feature vector is extracted from the n values using DFT. This process is repeated for the rest of the time series <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Discrete wave transform measures frequency at different time. Signal is projected into time frequency plane. Basis function is given in equation 2.</p><p>eq. 2.</p><p>Where is the mother wavelet function.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">PROPOSED MODEL .</head><p>In time series, order of values dependent on time is mandatory. An attempt has been made to identify the maxima or minima. In this model for identification of minima or maxima, Price and Volume weighted moving averages of ten days is used on weekly basis taken from the NSE tame software. In the previous works, it was found out that Fibonacci series can predict the time period when peak or trough will occur. Fibonacci series can be obtained recursively by .It can be interpreted as when price crosses the VWMA in uptrend then peak will occur either in 1,2,3,5,8,13…. time slots. It is difficult to predict the accurate time period because of infinite series. Similarly in down trend when prices goes down from the VWMA, trough will occur in 1,2,3,5,8,13….. time slots. Same dilemma exists in finding both minima and maxima because Fibonacci series is not restricted to one number. In this model all the prices of NIFTY are measured on weekly basis and trend reversal occurs when p t &gt;v t and in previous time slot v t &gt; p t was true. Where p t is price at time t and v t is the vwma at time t. Similarly another trend reversal occurs when v t &gt;p t and in previous time slot p t &gt;V t was true. Proposed algorithm for the finding minima, maxima, local minima and local maxima is given below.</p><p>Step 1.∆p is calculated as (price t -price t-1 ) , ∆ v is calculated as (vwma t -vwma t-1), ∆ 2 p is calculated as ∆p t -∆p t-1 and ∆ 2 v is calculated as ∆v t -∆v t-1 . step 2. ∆p/ ∆ v is calculated, if ratio is not near to zero. Then go to step 4.else go to step 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Step 3. If p t &gt; v t then</head><p>Step 3.1.1 If ∆ 2 p and ∆ 2 v are of different signs then maxima has occurred.</p><p>Step 3.1.2 If ∆ 2 p and ∆ 2 v are both negative and ∆ 2 p / ∆ 2 v is greater than 15 then maxima has occurred.</p><p>Step 3.2. If ∆ 2 p and ∆ 2 v are of same signs then local maxima has occurred.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Else if p t &lt;v t then</head><p>Step 3.3 If ∆ 2 p and ∆ 2 v are of different signs then minima has occurred.</p><p>Step 3.4. If ∆ 2 p and ∆ 2 v are of same signs then local minima has occurred.</p><p>Step 4. Continue with step 1 for next time slot iteration unless the trend reverses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">DATA ANALYSIS.</head><p>In the proposed model, model calculates ∆p/ ∆ v at every time slot. Where ever ∆p/ ∆v is near zero is identified, it is further analyzed to find the maxima and minima. A comparison is made between the first maxima signal value and the actual maxima value. It has been observed that signal occurred just near the extremes and gave very few signals of extremes even on very large time dependent financial series which can be verified by the results given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">table 2,table  3,table 4,table 5</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">CONCLUSION</head><p>Time series produces huge amount of data and it is very difficult to save the complete time series data and to retrieve the information accurately due to its mammoth size, Representation schemes solves the problem without losing the   <ref type="figure">alphabet (A,B,C,D)</ref> </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" validated="false"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>essential information. Symbolic time representation and discrete fourier transformation keeps the essential component to facilitate the indexing of time series. These representation schemes fails to identify the extremes of the time sequence, hence a derivative method is used in identification of extremes. It has been found out that extremes occur when (p t - p t-1 )/(v t -v t-1 ) is near zero and (∆p t -∆p t-1 ) and (∆v t -∆V t-1 ) are of different sign. Maxima may encounter soon even if (∆p t -∆p t-1 ) and (∆v t -∆V t-1 ) are of same negative sign provided ratio is very high.Table2.
