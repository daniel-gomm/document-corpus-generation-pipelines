<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>As the teaching of primary level mathematics (ages 5-13) is complex, it requires teachers to master a variety of types of knowledge. These are outlined as follows:</p><p>Understanding of important mathematical concepts that underpin meaningful student learning of the main strands of the mathematics curriculum;</p><p>• Appreciation of the mathematical processes (conceptual understanding, problem solving, and reasoning) in which students engage in doing mathematics, building mathematical arguments, and their justifications of solutions to problems; • Selecting and building into lessons tasks that engage students in meaningful mathematics and numeracy learning; • Awareness and knowledge of activities, tasks, and interventions that engage and develop persistence in students while exploring mathematical investigations; • Awareness and appreciation of the value of tools (manipulatives) and technology in students' building multiple representations of mathematical ideas; • Awareness of children's development in their learning of mathematical ideas (e.g. place value, number sense, operations) from informal to formal understandings;</p><p>Co-chairs:</p></div>
