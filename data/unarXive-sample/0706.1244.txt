In the context of supersymmetric compactifications of type II supergravity to
four dimensions, we show that orientifold sources can be compatible
with a generalized FORMULA -structure that is neither
strictly FORMULA  nor static FORMULA . We illustrate this with explicit
examples, obtained by suitably T-dualizing known solutions on the six-torus.
In addition we prove the following integrability statements, valid under certain mild assumptions:
(a) for general type II supergravity backgrounds with orientifold and/or
D-brane generalized-calibrated sources, the source-corrected Einstein and dilaton equations of motion
follow automatically from the supersymmetry equations once the likewise source-corrected form equations
of motion and Bianchi identities are imposed; (b) in the special case of supersymmetric compactifications to
four-dimensional Minkowski space,
the equations of motion of all fields, including the NSNS three-form,
follow automatically once the supersymmetry and the Bianchi identities of the forms are imposed.
Both (a) and (b) are equally valid whether the sources are smeared or localized. As
a byproduct we obtain the calibration form for a space-filling NS5-brane.
D-branes, orientifolds, FORMULA -structures, generalized geometry
Introduction
It has recently been appreciated that flux compactifications
(for reviews see e.g. {{cite:e42c2fb4-283d-4753-a562-0c94df02699d}}, {{cite:63f5faa3-cd1d-433c-bad0-049f7c3164cd}}, {{cite:23d771c3-f312-4b4a-bc2d-c50ed27f06dc}})
may be the right framework wherein to address long-standing issues which have
hitherto prevented string theory from making contact with realistic
low-energy physics. In this context, however, one faces the problem presented by
the large number of possible string theory flux vacua. String theory is approximated at low-energies
by ten-dimensional supergravity,
possibly enriched by `stringy' objects such as orientifolds and D-branes,
and therefore a logical starting point would be to try to
explore the nature of supergravity solutions with fluxes turned on. To that end
it is useful to have as many generally-valid results as possible.
A natural language in which to recast the conditions for a supersymmetric FORMULA 
flux compactification of type II supergravity to four-dimensional Minkowski space {{cite:e8e3413b-beb7-4fb1-aef3-9ab529e43a9a}}, {{cite:ee881770-4ff1-4f65-be3b-a19e127b9f40}}, {{cite:73d54c3f-2828-46f4-a2f1-bc18bafbdb98}}
is that of generalized complex geometry {{cite:84f3532e-77a1-4f5f-a1d9-48d05c8f642d}}, {{cite:754c675f-9fe6-4b50-9d54-0b919e46d437}}.
More specifically: for a supersymmetric FORMULA  vacuum the six-dimensional
internal space must support two compatible generalized
complex structures,
one of which is integrable while the other one is not – its nonintegrability being parameterized by the RR-fields.
The case of four-dimensional FORMULA 
AdS vacua can also be described in the same formalism,For a detailed analysis in the
language of ordinary FORMULA -structures, see {{cite:5d109562-c2ea-4a15-ba3c-36e4a69fea78}}, {{cite:ac81a387-bf08-4a17-98b7-722731625af6}}. The last
reference contains the most general
form of supersymmetric compactifications to AdSFORMULA  on manifolds
of FORMULA -structure, including a treatment of the equations of motion
and Bianchi identities. although in this case neither of the generalized complex structures is
integrable – hinting at a role for `almost' generalized complex geometry {{cite:ee881770-4ff1-4f65-be3b-a19e127b9f40}}, {{cite:9cba5b0c-aa05-48fc-99a7-529d5a2b8cc3}}.
Equations of motion
To obtain an FORMULA  vacuum the supersymmetry conditions
need to be supplemented by the form Bianchi identities
and equations of motion. General integrability results
ensure however that no further equations of motion need to be imposed.
Indeed, it was shown –
in {{cite:ac81a387-bf08-4a17-98b7-722731625af6}} for IIA and
in {{cite:7f95dfe3-2797-49cb-9c11-75bde539b790}} for IIB supergravity –
that the
Einstein equation and the dilaton equation of motion follow automatically from
the supersymmetry and the Bianchi identities and equations of motion of the
form-fields (for a discussion
in the context of M-theory see {{cite:d929aa36-537b-4939-aecf-8fb9f180d730}}).
Upon adding D-brane and/or
orientifold sources to the supergravity Lagrangian
there will be a contribution to the Einstein and dilaton equation from the Dirac-Born-Infeld
terms, and to the Bianchi identities and equations of motion of the RR-fields from the Chern-Simons terms.
As we show in the present paper, provided the sources are supersymmetric
(or, equivalently, as we will explain in the following, generalized-calibrated), both contributions
exactly conspire so that supersymmetry together with the Bianchi
identities and equations of motion of the form-fields
still imply the Einstein and dilaton equations of motionIn the special case of the backgrounds of {{cite:ac81a387-bf08-4a17-98b7-722731625af6}} with an O6 source,
it was verified in {{cite:afad688a-8951-4c6d-955c-5e10e39a04ff}} that the dilaton equation and the four-dimensional part
of the Einstein equation follow automatically,
provided that the sources are proportional to FORMULA  – which in that context implies that
they are calibrated..
In hindsight it is obvious that the Einstein and dilaton equations of motion could not have followed
from the supersymmetry conditions alone, as this would have left no room for source contributions.
Nevertheless, it was noted in {{cite:9cba5b0c-aa05-48fc-99a7-529d5a2b8cc3}} that, for the case of supersymmetric
compactifications to four-dimensional Minkowski vacua,
the equations of motion (but not the Bianchi identities) for the internal parts of the RR-fields do follow from the
supersymmetry equations. The rationale in this case is that the sources that would contribute to these equations
are forbidden because they would break the four-dimensional Poincaré symmetry. The proof is based on the integrability
of the generalized calibration conditions of the corresponding magnetic sources.
In the same way one would expect
the equation of motion for the NSNS FORMULA -field – having as a source the fundamental string – to follow from
the supersymmetry conditions. However, up to now it had not been possible to show this since the
equation of motion for the FORMULA -field does not fit well in the
generalized geometry framework {{cite:bf7dc232-1118-43e5-91d1-83abd52bdd8e}}. In the present paper
we will show that this equation does indeed follow from the supersymmetry equations and the Bianchi identities
– much like the case of the RR fields. As a bonus, the proof also provides the calibration form
for the space-filling NS5-brane.
The situation can thus be schematically summarized as follows:


SUSY
+
form BIs
(source-modified)
+
form EOMs
(source-modified)
FORMULA  

Einstein, dilaton EOMs
(source-modified)

for general backgrounds, and


SUSY
+
form BIs
(source-modified)
FORMULA  

form EOMs
(source-modified)
+
Einstein, dilaton EOMs
(source-modified)

for compactifications to four-dimensional Minkowski space. Let us note that
we did not consider the possibility of adding a source term to the Bianchi identity of the FORMULA -field,
which would be generated by NS5-branes, although we expect our integrability results to be readily extendable
to include that case. We stress that
the proof remains equally valid whether the source terms are localized or not –
the main requirement being that the sources are generalized-calibrated.
The concept of a generalized-calibrated
D-brane was introduced in {{cite:5506d3c1-356f-4f98-a5f0-7f73bd4d4c57}}, {{cite:a0f3a16f-1500-4916-a752-78524dbe951e}},
extending the work of {{cite:d41c6efe-91a2-4f9c-93e9-5f9522b3bb1f}}
to include a non-trivial gauge field FORMULA  on the world-volume.
A generalized-calibrated
D-brane extremizes its energy, rather than its volume
(which is the case for an ordinary calibration), and therefore corresponds to a (static)
solution of the equations of motion. Moreover, it was shown in {{cite:5506d3c1-356f-4f98-a5f0-7f73bd4d4c57}}, {{cite:a0f3a16f-1500-4916-a752-78524dbe951e}}
that the calibration conditions
are equivalent to the requirement that the D-brane preserve the supersymmetry of the background.
The D-branes originally considered in {{cite:5506d3c1-356f-4f98-a5f0-7f73bd4d4c57}}, {{cite:a0f3a16f-1500-4916-a752-78524dbe951e}} were localized;
the generalization of the calibration conditions
to the case of smeared D-brane/orientifold sources is straightforward.
The superpotential for the moduli space of generalized calibrations was introduced
in {{cite:8a4eae3f-67fe-4472-838d-4494ade10d8c}}, the deformation theory further studied in {{cite:18344af4-9c68-49ac-9849-e60f6f091dbe}},
and networks of calibrated D-branes in {{cite:56128534-262e-4e32-ac46-f9b85b762044}}.

Orientifolds
Independent of whether the vacuum is supersymmetric or not, in the case of
flux compactifications of ten-dimensional supergravity to
Minkowski space there exists a no-go theorem {{cite:10a07972-23f8-488c-97de-e158392a13e2}}, {{cite:7718c993-d194-4740-a95c-a460a0bc3b08}} which (under certain assumptions such
as the absence of higher-order derivative corrections) requires
the presence of sources with negative tension. In string theory,
such sources are indeed available: the orientifolds.
The supersymmetry conditions for orientifolds
in terms of the two generalized complex structures of the background, were
first studied in {{cite:80c8c1b0-38a8-4e66-bbd7-94e4a1b13cdf}}. In that reference,
the supersymmetry conditions were extrapolated from the analogous conditions in the (warped) Calabi-Yau case.
Subsequently, they were used in {{cite:9cba5b0c-aa05-48fc-99a7-529d5a2b8cc3}} to argue that orientifolds would only be
compatible with either strict FORMULA -structure, or
static FORMULA -structure.
This would then imply that
the most interesting cases from the point-of-view of generalized
complex geometry – i.e. solutions with dynamic FORMULA -structure which is
neither strictly FORMULA  nor
static FORMULA , but interpolates between the two – would effectively be excluded for flux compactifications.
In this paper we will derive and confirm the conditions of {{cite:80c8c1b0-38a8-4e66-bbd7-94e4a1b13cdf}}
from a world-sheet perspective, as was done earlier for the Calabi-Yau
case in {{cite:1b3c7054-b84e-4c71-a6de-f4a557e161de}}. We will however also show that the
argument of {{cite:9cba5b0c-aa05-48fc-99a7-529d5a2b8cc3}} is too restrictive, and that supersymmetric orientifolds can be
compatible with a dynamic FORMULA -structure.
Moreover starting from a so-called type FORMULA  (or “warped Calabi-Yau”) solution on a torus
and performing two T-dualities, we will provide explicit
examples on nilmanifolds.
A non-geometric background with dynamic FORMULA -structure and orientifold sources,
appeared recently in {{cite:752e44e4-d0ed-4490-a71f-483b67a59569}} (see also {{cite:2878717e-ce3d-4988-82d5-287212bb1494}}).
This paper is organized as follows. After a brief review of generalized
geometry and supersymmetric vacua in the next section, we come to the orientifold
analysis in section . Our results concerning the integrability
of the supersymmetry equations in the presence of sources are contained in section .
The source-corrected equation of motion for the NSNS three-form as well as
the NS5 calibration form, are derived in section .
We conclude in section .
Many useful technical details can be found in the appendices.
After this paper was posted on the hep-th archive, we were informed of a forthcoming
publication {{cite:3f0bc5f7-8bfb-4874-830b-6fc9623323c7}} with potential overlap with the present work.

Supersymmetry and generalized complex geometry
This section is a brief review of FORMULA  supersymmetric backgrounds in the
language of generalized geometry, and is included here mainly to establish notation and
conventions. For more details the reader is referred to appendices , .
For an introduction to generalized complex geometry we refer to e.g. section 3 of {{cite:9cba5b0c-aa05-48fc-99a7-529d5a2b8cc3}} or, for a more complete treatment, to the original
work of {{cite:754c675f-9fe6-4b50-9d54-0b919e46d437}}.
Setup
We will consider type II supergravity and, for most of the paper (with the exception of section ),
we will make the following compactification
ansatz for the metric
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the warp factor, FORMULA  the four-dimensional Minkowski metric, and FORMULA 
the metric of the
six-dimensional internal space. Apart from the metric, type II supergravity also contains the dilaton FORMULA ,
the NSNS three-form FORMULA  and the RR-fields FORMULA . We will use the democratic formalism of {{cite:a3f02741-c838-4d10-9596-edfa8703f9ff}}
As in {{cite:a0f3a16f-1500-4916-a752-78524dbe951e}}, we make the following changes with respect to {{cite:a3f02741-c838-4d10-9596-edfa8703f9ff}}: in IIB we take FORMULA  and in IIA FORMULA .
with a doubling of the number of RR-fields, so that FORMULA  in type IIA and FORMULA  in type IIB.
The additional RR fields then satisfy (REF ). For further details on our conventions on type II supergravity see appendix .
For the RR-fields, the most general ansatz compatible with four-dimensional Poincaré
invariance reads:
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  the (warped) four-dimensional volume form.
In addition, the most general ansatz for FORMULA  supersymmetry in four dimensions is
FORMULA 
where the upper/lower sign is for type IIA/IIB respectively,
and FORMULA , FORMULA  are the complex conjugates of
FORMULA , FORMULA . For our detailed spinor conventions we refer to section REF .
We define FORMULA  and FORMULA . As shown in {{cite:a0f3a16f-1500-4916-a752-78524dbe951e}},
supersymmetric D-branes require FORMULA , which
will also be the case for supersymmetric orientifolds as we demonstrate in section ;
we will assume this to be the case in the rest of the paper.
From bilinears of the internal spinors FORMULA  one
can construct the FORMULA  pure spinors FORMULA  as follows
FORMULA 
where the underline replaces the Dirac slash as in (REF ).
Indeed, we can identify polyforms, i.e. sums of forms of different dimensions, with spinor bilinears by contracting
the indices with gamma-matrices. On the other hand,
the polyforms are also isomorphic to spinors of FORMULA 
(up to a choice of the volume form),
with the FORMULA  Clifford action defined as in (REF ).
These spinors are pure, i.e. they have a null space of maximal dimension; for FORMULA 
this is equal to six.
Indeed, in the spinor bilinear picture the null space consists of the three
annihilators of FORMULA  acting on
the left and the three annihilators/creators of FORMULA  acting on the right.
In {{cite:ee881770-4ff1-4f65-be3b-a19e127b9f40}} it was shown that the supersymmetry
variations of the fermions () vanish for
the above ansatz – so that the compactification
preserves FORMULA  supersymmetry – if and only if
FORMULA 


In the above we have
normalized the internal spinors such that FORMULA . Moreover,
we set FORMULA , FORMULA  for type IIA/IIB respectively.
The twisted exterior derivative FORMULA  is given by FORMULA .
It was noted in {{cite:a0f3a16f-1500-4916-a752-78524dbe951e}} that the above equations correspond to
space-filling, domain wall and string-like D-branes respectively, indicating
a close relation between the background supersymmetry and its supersymmetric probes.
In the language of FORMULA -structures the internal manifolds above have a structure group
contained in FORMULA  – since they have at least one
nowhere-vanishing spinor: FORMULA . The appearance of a second
invariant spinor FORMULA  translates to the statement that
the internal manifolds have FORMULA -structure.
This terminology may be somewhat
confusing from the point-of-view of ordinary FORMULA -structures,
since the second spinor may or may not be different from the first one.
In fact, in six dimensions the most general
relation between the two spinors is
FORMULA 
If FORMULA  and FORMULA  are everywhere parallel, i.e. FORMULA  and FORMULA , we say that we
have a strict FORMULA -structure; if the two spinors are everywhere orthogonal,
i.e. FORMULA ,
we have a static FORMULA -structure.
The interpolating, generic, case is called dynamic FORMULA -structure
or local FORMULA -structure. In the latter case,
it is possible to have FORMULA  at generic points and either FORMULA  or FORMULA  at special points –
which, as will shortly become clear, means that the type (the lowest
form-dimension appearing in the
corresponding polyform) of one of the pure spinors changes.
The existence of a static FORMULA -structure implies that the internal manifold has FORMULA -structure
in the ordinary sense. On the other hand,
the existence of a dynamic FORMULA -structure
does not generally impose any further topological constraints beyond the existence of an
FORMULA -structure in the ordinary sense {{cite:754c675f-9fe6-4b50-9d54-0b919e46d437}}, except if FORMULA  everywhere
which leads again to FORMULA -structure.
In the orientifold examples of section REF  of this
paper, we will be considering structures on nilmanifolds (see appendix
 for a brief review)
that are constant in the basis of left-invariant one-forms. In particular, this
implies that FORMULA  everywhere.
From the discussion of the previous paragraph, it then follows
that in these examples the internal manifolds have FORMULA -structure in the ordinary sense.
This is of course not a surprise, as nilmanifolds are parallelizable and have in fact
a trivial FORMULA -structure (i.e. their structure group is the identity).
It follows that in the nilmanifold case there exists a
complete basis of invariant spinors allowing for an extended supersymmetry ansatz.
This does not necessarily lead to vacua with extended supersymmetry in four dimensions,
since the differential equations (REF ) have to be satisfied in addition.
This observation highlights a point which is a frequent
source of confusion, and is therefore worth emphasizing:
the generalized-structure of a
supergravity solution refers to the spinor ansatz,
not to the topological FORMULA -structure of the internal manifold.

(Local) FORMULA -structure
For local and static FORMULA , it will be convenient
to express the pure spinors in terms of FORMULA -structure quantities.
Following {{cite:9cba5b0c-aa05-48fc-99a7-529d5a2b8cc3}},
we introduce a unimodular internal spinor FORMULA  and set
FORMULA 


with FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Comparing with (REF ) we have
FORMULA 
This description is redundant,
so that we can choose FORMULA  and FORMULA  real and positive and absorb their phases in FORMULA  and FORMULA 
respectively. We then
have FORMULA  and FORMULA .
We can also rotate FORMULA  so that FORMULA , and therefore
only the phase of FORMULA  has physical meaning.
Let us define
FORMULA 


where FORMULA . The somewhat asymmetric notation highlights the fact that, except in the case of static FORMULA -structure, FORMULA  and FORMULA 
are different from the corresponding quantities built from FORMULA :
FORMULA 
With these definitions it follows that
FORMULA 


where FORMULA  is the one-form dual to the vector FORMULA .
The two-form FORMULA  satisfies FORMULA . Moreover
FORMULA 


where
FORMULA 
so that FORMULA .
Another useful expression we will need later on is
FORMULA 
With the above definitions we can reexpress the pure spinors (REF ) as follows
FORMULA 


with FORMULA . These relations can be inverted using (REF ).
We can now see that the type (the lowest form-dimension in a polyform)
of FORMULA  is in general FORMULA .
At special points where FORMULA  or FORMULA , it jumps to FORMULA  or FORMULA  respectively.

Orientifolds
We now come to the study of supersymmetric orientifolds and, in particular, their
compatibility with the different types of generalized structures defined in the
previous section. After deriving the action of the orientifold involution on the pure spinors,
we will argue that the claim of {{cite:9cba5b0c-aa05-48fc-99a7-529d5a2b8cc3}} can be relaxed, and
supersymmetric orientifolds can be compatible
with dynamic FORMULA -structure.
The orientifold involution
An orientifold action FORMULA  is a composition of a reflection on the world-sheet
(denoted by FORMULA )
exchanging the left-movers with the right-movers,
and a target-space involution FORMULA  (FORMULA  on bosonic fields) acting
on the internal manifold. A factor FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the
fermion number of the left-movers, is sometimes needed to ensure FORMULA 
on all states including spinors. Whether it appears or not depends on the
number of FORMULA -eigenvalues of FORMULA , which also determines the dimensionality of
the orientifold plane. This is the fixed point set of the involution which,
in our case, fills the four-dimensional space-time.
In detail, the orientifold projection is given by
FORMULA 


In our conventions the O6 projection does not contain a FORMULA  factor:
see appendix REF  for more details.
For the dilaton FORMULA , metric FORMULA  and NSNS three-form FORMULA  to be invariant
under the total orientifold projection FORMULA , they have to transform under the involution as
FORMULA 
For the RR fields we need
FORMULA 


where the action of FORMULA  on forms is defined in (REF ).
The orientifold is supersymmetric if and only
if the orientifold operator leaves the total supersymmetry
generator FORMULA  invariant.
Since FORMULA  exchanges left- and right-moving supersymmetry generators, we have
FORMULA 


where FORMULA  is responsible for the sign difference between the two
lines. Note that using (REF ), at the orientifold plane locus we find
(with suitable orientation conventions) exactly the same formula as eq. (REF ) for D-branes, provided we set
FORMULA .
Plugging in the ansatz (REF ),
we immediately see that FORMULA  is forced by the orientifold action
to be the same in both lines of (REF ) forbidding an FORMULA  ansatz based on different FORMULA s
in the two linesAn FORMULA  ansatz based on a doubling of the internal invariant spinors is still possible. See e.g. the example in REF ..
Furthermore, taking (REF ) into account together
with the fact that FORMULA  contains an even/odd number of internal FORMULA -matrices
in IIB/IIA respectively,
we arrive at the following simple action on the internal supersymmetry generators
FORMULA 


From FORMULA  it follows that for supersymmetric orientifolds,
just as for supersymmetric D-branes, we should have FORMULA .
Furthermore, using (REF ), we see that
FORMULA 


which agrees with the conjectured transformations
of {{cite:80c8c1b0-38a8-4e66-bbd7-94e4a1b13cdf}}, {{cite:9cba5b0c-aa05-48fc-99a7-529d5a2b8cc3}}.
As a consistency check, one can verify that using (REF )
and (REF ), the equations (REF )
as well as the Calabi-Yau condition (REF )
transform covariantly. Finally, one can readily see that the generalized metric induced
by FORMULA  in the way explained around (REF ), is FORMULA .

Compatibility of dynamic FORMULA -structure with orientifolds
Let us start with relation (REF )
and solve for FORMULA  to obtain:
FORMULA 
On the other hand, using (REF ) we see that in
type IIB (REF ) transforms under FORMULA  as
FORMULA 
where the upper/lower sign is for FORMULA  and FORMULA  respectively.
Comparing with (REF ) we find
FORMULA 


By considering this relation at the
orientifold fixed plane we find that
FORMULA . Moreover FORMULA  must be
perpendicular to the FORMULA , along the FORMULA  respectively.
For FORMULA  and FORMULA  we find that FORMULA  at the fixed plane.
We conclude that a supersymmetric O3-plane,
just as a D3-brane, can only exist at
points where the type is FORMULA . It follows that static FORMULA -structure is incompatible with
O3-planes.
Let us now look at IIA, for which (REF ) transforms under FORMULA  as
FORMULA 
The upper/lower sign is for FORMULA , FORMULA  respectively.
Comparing this with the complex conjugate of (REF )
FORMULA 
we find
FORMULA 


By considering these relations at the FORMULA  fixed plane,
we see that we must have FORMULA . It follows that the case of FORMULA  is
incompatible with strict FORMULA -structure.
From
(REF ) and (REF ) we see that
FORMULA 
Considering (REF ) and (REF ) on the orientifold plane itself
we find that the phase FORMULA , defined in (REF ), is completely fixed for O3,O5,O7 and O9.
This phase is commonly used to classify strict FORMULA  compactifications: FORMULA  is called type B and
FORMULA  is called type C, and so we see here that this carries over to some extent.
Moreover, on the O3- and O9-plane we can only have type FORMULA  for the pure spinors FORMULA  and on the O4- and O8-plane only type FORMULA .
We stress again that off the orientifold plane there are no such restrictions. If we specialize however to e.g. constant structures on nil- or
solvmanifolds, these properties do carry over to the whole internal manifold.
We list these properties in table REF .
TABLE 
We can explicitly work out the orientifold action in terms of the forms defined in (REF ) in two ways.
We can either start from (REF ) and definitions (REF ),
or we can use (REF )
and (REF ) instead. In both cases we find
FORMULA 


for IIB, and
FORMULA 


for IIA. We can now
see precisely where the caveat in the
proof of {{cite:9cba5b0c-aa05-48fc-99a7-529d5a2b8cc3}} lies: the requirement
that FORMULA  and FORMULA  should not mix under the orientifold involution is too strong.
Defining FORMULA 
and FORMULA  with FORMULA  for IIB,
FORMULA 
and FORMULA  with FORMULA  for IIA,
we find
FORMULA 


This is a rotation, over an angle FORMULA , in the FORMULA -space.

Examples from T-duality
We will now illustrate the point made in the previous subsection, i.e. that orientifolds can be
compatible with a dynamic FORMULA -structure, by considering two
explicit examples obtained by T-duality from known solutions. The first of the two
has FORMULA  supersymmetry, and is therefore somewhat trivial; the
second one has FORMULA .
Example 1
We start from a compactification on the torus FORMULA  with an FORMULA -plane and
imaginary self-dual FORMULA  –
a so-called type B solution –
and apply two T-dualities, ending up with a nilmanifold. This was first considered
in {{cite:42829bd3-2c3d-4265-8c23-5c6a5d766a9e}}. The way to obtain a dynamic FORMULA -structure is to
choose one of the T-duality directions `misaligned'
with the complex structure. For ease of
comparison we will start from one of
the T-dual solutions discussed in {{cite:9cba5b0c-aa05-48fc-99a7-529d5a2b8cc3}}.
For a type B or `warped Calabi-Yau' solution we have a strict FORMULA -structure with pure spinors
following from (REF ) in the limit  FORMULA
FORMULA 
where for compatibility with FORMULA -branes
we must have FORMULA . The supersymmetry conditions read
(see e.g. {{cite:7058ab30-9c17-426d-a6d3-179541e77144}}, {{cite:e42c2fb4-283d-4753-a562-0c94df02699d}})
FORMULA 


The last condition (together with FORMULA  which follows from the first condition) can be
rephrased
as the well-known
statement that FORMULA  is imaginary (anti-)self-dual: FORMULA .
We take the following explicit solution for  FORMULA
FORMULA 


which can be obtained by rotating FORMULA  and FORMULA  of the example
on p. 50 of {{cite:9cba5b0c-aa05-48fc-99a7-529d5a2b8cc3}}
by an angle FORMULA  in the FORMULA -plane,
keeping FORMULA  fixed. The vielbeins FORMULA  satisfy FORMULA .
One can easily verify that this still solves (REF ) for all values of FORMULA .
We now perform a T-duality in the
directions FORMULA  and FORMULA .
The transformation of the vielbein under a T-duality in the direction FORMULA  is given in
{{cite:364f44f0-8a5e-48f2-81f0-34f9fc6fe246}}
and reads
FORMULA 
with
FORMULA 
We can take the gauge choice FORMULA  so that:
FORMULA 


and all other vielbein components remain unchanged.
From (REF ) we read off that we end up with nilmanifold FORMULA ,
which is FORMULA  of table 4 of {{cite:9cba5b0c-aa05-48fc-99a7-529d5a2b8cc3}}.
The T-dual vielbein is FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and FORMULA  for FORMULA .
Furthermore, in the flat coordinates corresponding to the T-dual vielbeins, FORMULA 
remains unchanged while
FORMULA  undergoes a reflection in the 5 and 6 direction:
FORMULA 
Using (REF ) one can easily check that
this relation corresponds to the action of an O5 orientifold along FORMULA .
From (REF ) we can read off
FORMULA 


where we assume that FORMULA . For FORMULA  we find static FORMULA -structure while for FORMULA 
we have strict FORMULA . From (REF ) and (REF ) we find
FORMULA 


Finally, after the two T-dualities the dilaton, NSNS three-form and RR fluxes take the form
FORMULA 


One can verify that this solves the supersymmetry equations (REF ).
Moreover we find for the source
FORMULA 

where FORMULA  is the Laplacian constructed from the unwarped metric in FORMULA .
This has indeed the right sign for an orientifold, as will be argued below in (REF ),
and indeed corresponds
to the O5-plane obtained by applying two T-dualities to the original O3-plane.
The “modulus” FORMULA  appears in the pure spinors, but not in the metric nor in any of the form-fields.
These non-metric moduli were discussed in some detail in {{cite:2a563436-6d91-4e1a-ba20-7ddc1ec274e6}}. It was shown that for FORMULA -structure
they are in the vector representation, and were excluded by hand.
These moduli are signals of extended supersymmetry, indicating that the FORMULA  description is not
appropriate anymore. Indeed, different
pure spinors (and thus also different pairs FORMULA  of ordinary spinors)
are possible for the same background.
Since the supersymmetry equations () are linear, we can take an arbitrary linear combination
with independent four-dimensional spinors FORMULA  and thus make an extended supersymmetry ansatz. For  FORMULA
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  (and complex conjugates FORMULA  and FORMULA ) generating the four-dimensional supersymmetry.
As was already noted in {{cite:9cba5b0c-aa05-48fc-99a7-529d5a2b8cc3}}, the present example does indeed have FORMULA  supersymmetry.
Explicitly, in the above ansatz we can take
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the internal spinor generating the FORMULA  and FORMULA  of (REF ).
The pure spinors built from (REF ),(REF )
can be obtained by taking FORMULA 
and FORMULA , with FORMULA  generating the corresponding FORMULA  spinor ansatz.
Hence the dynamic FORMULA -structure is rather trivial in this example, since the same background
can be equally well described either
by a strict FORMULA - or by a static FORMULA -structure. Rather, one should
use the FORMULA  ansatz (REF ) instead.
We now turn to our next example, which
only has FORMULA  supersymmetry.

Example 2
Let us consider the type IIB example on p. 51 of {{cite:9cba5b0c-aa05-48fc-99a7-529d5a2b8cc3}}, which corresponds to an
FORMULA  solution on the flat six-torus
FORMULA . We make the following coordinate transformation:
FORMULA 

After the above transformation, the metric is no longer diagonal along the
FORMULA  directions:
FORMULA 

and the vielbein in these directions is
FORMULA 

In addition, let us define FORMULA , which should not be confused with the vielbein that
takes the above non-diagonal form.
Equation (REF ) is merely a coordinate transformation, so we still have a solution of eqs. (REF ).
We have in mind to perform two T-dualities along the direction FORMULA  and the transformed direction FORMULA 
so let us focus on the part of the FORMULA -structure containing FORMULA :
FORMULA 

with
FORMULA 

Moreover, after the transformation the
NSNS three-form FORMULA  takes on the simple form
FORMULA 

so that with a gauge choice we can set
FORMULA 
The action of the two T-dualities on the spinors can be immediately read off
from eqs. (REF ), (REF ) and is given by
FORMULA , where FORMULA , and
FORMULA 

In the above it is understood that FORMULA  is defined using the original vielbein.
Comparing with (REF ),
we see that we
end up with dynamic FORMULA -structure. As before we also have an O5-plane, which
in this case is along the directions 1 and 6.
To actually determine the T-dual vielbein and nilmanifold we have to work a little harder.
Proceeding similarly to the previous example,
the action of T-duality
on the vielbein is encoded in the matrices FORMULA , FORMULA , defined
in (REF ). The T-dual vielbein, FORMULA , is then given by
FORMULA 
It follows that
FORMULA 
Putting FORMULA  and FORMULA  otherwise, we find,
after some further relabelling and changing signs,
the nilmanifold FORMULA  of table 4 of {{cite:9cba5b0c-aa05-48fc-99a7-529d5a2b8cc3}}.
Concluding, we arrive at the following recipe for constructing
examples by T-duality. We start from a constant (up to a warp factor)
type B solution on the torus. Then we perform two T-dualities along, say 5 and 6, where to end up with
a dynamic FORMULA -structure, we only need to make sure that both FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are non-zero. This amounts to choosing the T-dual directions “misaligned”
with the FORMULA -structure. Furthermore we should have FORMULA  since otherwise
we would end up with a non-geometric T-dual. The resulting nilmanifold then only depends on FORMULA 
since we find FORMULA  and FORMULA . With two T-dualities we then find
O5-backgrounds on nilmanifolds from 4.4 in table 4 of {{cite:9cba5b0c-aa05-48fc-99a7-529d5a2b8cc3}} on. Furthermore, it turns out that
by performing three T-dualities in this way one can only get strict FORMULA -structure.

Integrability in the presence of calibrated sources
In this section we show that – under certain conditions –
in a bosonic supersymmetric background
the Einstein equation as well as the dilaton equation of motion follow
from setting the supersymmetry variations of the fermions to zero,
provided the equations of motion and Bianchi identities of all form-fields
are also imposed and the sources are calibrated. The conditions mentioned are that
there is a time/space split and that the sources are static,
without any world-volume electric fields. Moreover, the time/space components
of the Einstein equation FORMULA  have to be imposed by hand.
In the absence of sources,
this was already shown in {{cite:ac81a387-bf08-4a17-98b7-722731625af6}} for IIA and {{cite:7f95dfe3-2797-49cb-9c11-75bde539b790}}
for IIB, so here we will focus on the contribution of the sources.
The proof relies on the fact that  the sources are generalized calibrated.
This follows naturally from the fact that the source
should preserve the supersymmetry of the background. As we will see, the
generalization to the case of smeared sources is straightforward.
For concreteness, let us
consider a single localized supersymmetric
D-brane source with world-volume FORMULA  and world-volume
gauge field FORMULA , such that FORMULA . The
case of a localized orientifold source can be obtained from the present analysis by
replacing FORMULA  and setting FORMULA .
Moreover, since the whole argument depends linearly on
the sources, it can be readily extended to arbitrary sums of D-branes and orientifolds.
The action for a localized D-brane source is given by
FORMULA 

where FORMULA  are the gauge potentials defined above (REF ) and FORMULA  are their magnetic duals.
At the level of the equations of motion the duality constraint (REF ) will identify both, but at the level
of the action they should still be considered as differentWe thank Toine Van Proeyen for discussions on this point. This
subtlety let to a mistake of a factor of 2 in () in the previous version of this paper.. The second term on the right hand side – which contributes to the equations of
motion and Bianchi identities of the RR-fields – is the easiest to analyse,
so let us consider that one first.
To proceed we define a current FORMULA  associated to
the D-brane FORMULA  such that for any polyform  FORMULA
FORMULA 
This current, introduced in this form in {{cite:18344af4-9c68-49ac-9849-e60f6f091dbe}},
can be thought of as a pure spinor whose annihilator space is the generalized
tangent bundle FORMULA  associated to FORMULA  {{cite:754c675f-9fe6-4b50-9d54-0b919e46d437}}.
So we can associate a pure spinor with a single source.
From FORMULA  it follows that
FORMULA 
so FORMULA  defines a generalized cocycle
in FORMULA -twisted cohomology {{cite:56128534-262e-4e32-ac46-f9b85b762044}}. In the democratic formalism,
the RR part of the action reads
FORMULA 
which immediately leads to the source-corrected equations of motion and Bianchi identities ().
The first term on the right-hand side of
(REF ) is more complicated. In fact, without some relation
between the two terms of the D-brane action, we cannot expect it to give
an exactly matching contribution to the Einstein and dilaton equations.
This relation is of course provided by
the calibration condition, which is equivalent {{cite:5506d3c1-356f-4f98-a5f0-7f73bd4d4c57}}, {{cite:a0f3a16f-1500-4916-a752-78524dbe951e}} to the
requirement that
the D-brane source should be supersymmetric {{cite:6300193c-3395-4600-aee9-bb5af007b276}}.
In the conventions of {{cite:a0f3a16f-1500-4916-a752-78524dbe951e}}:
FORMULA 
with
FORMULA 
Moreover,
FORMULA 
Calibration
To show that a supersymmetric D-brane source is necessarily
calibrated we proceed along the lines of {{cite:5506d3c1-356f-4f98-a5f0-7f73bd4d4c57}}, {{cite:a0f3a16f-1500-4916-a752-78524dbe951e}}.
We extend that result to a more general setting and show
that when the D-brane is calibrated the Dirac-Born-Infeld action
reduces to an integration of the calibration form (appropriately twisted by FORMULA ).
To make progress we must separate the time coordinate, so that the structure group
reduces as FORMULA . Note that
this is a weaker condition than the
four-dimensional compactification ansatz FORMULA 
assumed in the other sections of the paper and in {{cite:5506d3c1-356f-4f98-a5f0-7f73bd4d4c57}}, {{cite:a0f3a16f-1500-4916-a752-78524dbe951e}}.
The reason for making this time/space split is that there is a scalar representation in the
tensor decomposition of the FORMULA  spinor bilinear, while this is not the case for FORMULA 
bilinears with spinors of the same chirality.
This allows us to define spinor norms, a prerequisite for the calibration argument which we will review in a moment.
In particular, the metric takes the form
FORMULA 
The supersymmetry parameters decompose as follows
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the commuting FORMULA  part of the supersymmetry parameters.
The gamma-matrices decompose accordingly as
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  the Pauli matrices, and FORMULA  the 9-dimensional gamma-matrices.
We will take the latter to be real and symmetric. We
also need to impose a further condition, namely that FORMULA  splits as
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  purely spatial.
This will be the case if the D-brane configuration is static and there are no
electric world-volume fields. We note that this excludes some
interesting supersymmetric configurations such as the BIon {{cite:449cada3-17e9-4b3e-b5ca-89347c81f6c1}}.
It follows from (REF ) that FORMULA  is symmetric, so that the norms of
the FORMULA  parts of the two
supersymmetry generators are equal:
FORMULA .
We are now ready to derive a calibration bound for the Dirac-Born-Infeld action
in a way completely analogous to {{cite:5506d3c1-356f-4f98-a5f0-7f73bd4d4c57}} (see {{cite:ae311eba-5061-4eb4-a612-18e2ac13d5b0}} for an earlier version).
We work purely in the spatial part and define
FORMULA 
so that
FORMULA 
We sandwich both sides between FORMULA  and FORMULA  and insert
a complete set FORMULA 
to find
FORMULA 
Because FORMULA  the right-hand side
is in fact a sum of squares,
while in a supersymmetric configuration only the term with
FORMULA  survives.
We have thus arrived at the advertised result that supersymmetric D-branes correspond
to generalized calibrated D-branes.
Indeed the Dirac-Born-Infeld part of the action, expanded around the supersymmetric configuration,
reduces as followsIf in addition one wishes to show that these D-branes minimize
the action, one would need to show that the remaining part of
the Dirac-Born-Infeld together with the Chern-Simons term is invariant under deformations. This amounts
to showing that FORMULA . Upon a FORMULA  split this indeed
follows from the background supersymmetry equations (REF ).
For the minimal FORMULA  split we leave the analysis for future work {{cite:f4343e57-a6fb-4f70-a851-92ee025261a3}}.
FORMULA 
with
FORMULA 
By FORMULA  we mean that the corrections to this calibrated configuration are quadratic in the
supersymmetry condition (REF ).
The contribution to the dilaton and Einstein equations of motion can now
be read off:
FORMULA 


In the above equations we use ten-dimensional notation, but the
reader should keep in mind that FORMULA  transforms covariantly
only under time-independent coordinate transformations. Note in particular
that, as expected for static sources, the mixed time/space components on the
right-hand side of (REF ) vanish.
The complete set of equations – including the contribution of the sources – for type II
supergravity is summarized in appendix .
So far we have assumed that
FORMULA  corresponds to a localized source, however the generalization
to smeared sources is immediate. We simply need to take (REF ) as
the starting point for the Dirac-Born-Infeld action, in addition to imposing the calibration condition.
The rest of the proof remains unchanged, whether
the source is smeared or localized.

Integrability
Let us now come to the proof that supersymmetry
implies the dilaton and Einstein equations of motion,
provided that the form equations of motion and
Bianchi identities are satisfied.
In the absence of sources this has already been discussed
in detail in {{cite:ac81a387-bf08-4a17-98b7-722731625af6}}, {{cite:7f95dfe3-2797-49cb-9c11-75bde539b790}}, so we only need to focus on the
contribution of the sources.
As already stressed, the crucial input for the proof to go through
is that the source terms are calibrated.
Let us use FORMULA  for the FORMULA -form part of FORMULA .
After some standard
(see for example {{cite:ac81a387-bf08-4a17-98b7-722731625af6}})
gamma-matrix manipulations, taking the gravitino variation
() as well as
the identity
FORMULA 
into account,
it follows thatWe have found it
most convenient to perform the computation in the Einstein frame and then translate
back to the string frame.
FORMULA 

where FORMULA  is the Einstein equation without sources and the ellipsis
denotes terms that vanish under the projection onto the traceless symmetric part,
which we will apply in a moment.
To obtain the source term in the equation above, we also made use
of the following relation, which is a consequence of (),
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
and the ellipsis denotes terms which do not depend on the sources.
To proceed, we can take the above equation for either FORMULA 
or FORMULA , make the decomposition (REF ) of the spinor and hit
on the left with FORMULA  or FORMULA  respectively.
Next, we project on the traceless and symmetric (in FORMULA  and FORMULA ) part. For FORMULA  and FORMULA  purely spatial
we can take into account the following useful identity
FORMULA 

where both sides should be thought of as projected onto the traceless part.
In this way, we arrive at
exactly the traceless part of the source-corrected Einstein equation (REF ). Just as
in the absence of sources (see e.g. {{cite:ac81a387-bf08-4a17-98b7-722731625af6}}, {{cite:7f95dfe3-2797-49cb-9c11-75bde539b790}}),
the mixed time/space components of the
Einstein equation FORMULA  have to be imposed by hand. Note that, as remarked below
(REF ), the mixed time/space components of the source contribution
vanish identically for static sources.
The dilaton equation can be treated similarly.
From the supersymmetry variations () it
follows that
FORMULA 

where FORMULA  is the dilaton equation in the absence of sources.
In the same way as above it correctly reproduces the trace of the source-corrected dilaton
equation ().
Equation (REF ) can be arrived at by noting that
FORMULA 
where the ellipsis denotes source-independent terms.
Finally, the trace of the Einstein equation ()
follows from similar manipulations,
after using the dilaton equation to substitute for FORMULA .

The equation of motion for  FORMULA
For a compactification to four-dimensional Minkowski space, only space-time filling sources are allowed.
Indeed, sources that only partially fill the four-dimensional space-time would break Poincaré symmetry, while
instantonic sources are not
allowed in supergravity with Minkowskian signature. Such “forbidden”
sources would appear
in the equations of motion of FORMULA . As shown in {{cite:9cba5b0c-aa05-48fc-99a7-529d5a2b8cc3}} exactly these equations of motion
follow – without source terms –
from the integrability of (REF )
FORMULA 
where, as in the rest of this paper,
we assume that there are no NS5-brane sources so that FORMULA .
The equation of motion for FORMULA  would have as a source the fundamental string which is similarly forbidden.
Since this equation does not fit very well in the language of generalized geometry, it is harder to show that
it also follows from supersymmetry. Nevertheless, a (tedious)
calculation shows that, taking (REF ) into account, supersymmetry implies:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are constructed from FORMULA  and FORMULA  respectively as in
(REF ) and (REF ).
The calculation is quite similar to the one which shows that
(REF ) follows from the supersymmetry
equations.
The term between the outer brackets on the left-hand side is
the calibration form for a space-filling NS5-brane.
The right-hand side then corresponds to its magnetic coupling to FORMULA  and its couplings,
via a Chern-Simons-like term,
to the RR-fields. This may be difficult to derive directly from the NS5-brane world-volume
action, which is rather complicated. It follows from the above that for strict FORMULA -structure and FORMULA ,
a calibrated NS5-brane is not possible. However setting FORMULA  or FORMULA  (this
leads to the so-called
type A solutions, which only have NSNS-flux and
are common to type IIA, IIB and heterotic theory {{cite:0d8e7a6b-e68b-498c-a6b6-5570b15155c7}}),
one finds space-filling supersymmetric NS5-branes
calibrating FORMULA  or FORMULA  respectively. These were studied in {{cite:c4b2ae61-3ddc-40bd-8dca-48391028b2a2}}.
Taking the exterior derivative of equation (REF ) leads to the
source-corrected equation of motion for
the FORMULA -field:
FORMULA 
The contribution from the sources vanishes in some
common cases, like O3- and O5-planes, which may be the reason why it was not noted before.
We conclude that the equation of motion for FORMULA  is implied by the supersymmetry and
the Bianchi identities. The proof highlights the fact that the close relationship
between background supersymmetry conditions and calibrations also holds for NS5-branes.

Conclusions
We have seen that not only D-brane sources, but also supersymmetric orientifolds can be compatible
with a dynamic FORMULA -structure. This opens up the possibility
for the construction of compactification manifolds which are
highly non-trivial from the generalized-geometry point-of-view.
Taking the integrability results of this paper into account we can summarize
the minimal conditions that a supersymmetric vacuum has to obey as in appendix .
Unfortunately an extensive, although not exhaustive, scan of the nilmanifolds and solvmanifolds
has produced no explicit examples – except for the ones that are T-dual to the six-torus.
As in {{cite:9cba5b0c-aa05-48fc-99a7-529d5a2b8cc3}} we restricted
to left-invariant structures, i.e. structures that are constant in terms of the left-invariant
one-forms, and orientifolds whose action takes a simple diagonal form in this basis.
Our results may be pointing to the fact
that these genuine generalized-structure backgrounds are very rare.
Alternatively, it may be
that nilmanifolds and solvmanifolds are simply not the right class to look for examples,
or the two simplifying assumptions we made within this class are too restrictive.
We should keep in mind that
the authors of {{cite:9cba5b0c-aa05-48fc-99a7-529d5a2b8cc3}} only found a few examples of static FORMULA - and strict FORMULA -structure,
all of them on just two of these manifolds.
Although the equation of motion for the NSNS three-form does not fit very well in the
generalized-geometry framework, we were able to show that – for compactifications
to four-dimensional Minkowski space – it simply follows from the supersymmetry conditions and the
Bianchi identities. Not having to impose this equation as an extra condition,
should facilitate mathematical considerations concerning general properties of generalized vacua,
such as have recently appeared in {{cite:bf7dc232-1118-43e5-91d1-83abd52bdd8e}}. Furthermore we have established that the close connection
between the supersymmetry conditions of the background and the generalized calibrations
of supersymmetric probes, extends to the case of the NS5-brane.
Our integrability results show that the usefulness of generalized calibrations
extends beyond the probe approximation to fully back-reacting sources. Indeed,
having precisely these calibrated sources ensures that the source-corrected Einstein and dilaton equations still
follow from the supersymmetry conditions and the equations for the form fields.
Since the supersymmetry equations are much easier to analyse than the
equations of motion, our integrability results open up a host of new possibilities
for supergravity solutions with (smeared) sources. The potential phenomenological importance
of such vacua was recently noted in {{cite:afad688a-8951-4c6d-955c-5e10e39a04ff}}.
Of potential phenomenological importance is also the application of our results
to FORMULA : five-dimensional AdS space can be thought of (in appropriate coordinates) as
four-dimensional warped Minkowski space, and therefore the relevant
strong integrability statement of the present paper applies. In many
physically interesting setups one would like to consider the addition of back-reacting sources
to the background, leading to source-modified Bianchi identities.
In the past several authors have checked on a case-by-case basis
{{cite:13e9a31d-c099-49e3-bbb2-f4fa0e1a02f7}}, {{cite:3b32ee50-d47a-43ab-9580-559051b21497}}, {{cite:02700071-d331-4fce-aa81-cc4659fac366}}, {{cite:a8fa5d82-de4e-40a6-b73e-98ccb57ca606}} that once a supersymmetric FORMULA  background with
supersymmetric sources satisfies the
source-modified Bianchi identities, the source-modified dilaton and Einstein equations follow.
Thanks to the results of the present paper, we now know that this is in fact a general result.
The study of four-dimensional AdS vacua from the point-of-view of generalized structure,
would also be an interesting avenue for future research.
Finally, it would be interesting to obtain an alternative
derivation of the calibration form for the space-filling NS5-brane presented here,
directly from a world-volume analysis. Exploiting the connection between bulk supersymmetry
and calibrated probes, may lead to a better handle on
the complicated world-volume action for the NS5-brane.

Notation, conventions and useful formulae
In this appendix we explain in more
detail our conventions and notation, and we summarize
several useful technical points referred to in the main text.
General
Let FORMULA  be the operator that reverses all the indices of a (poly)form
FORMULA 
The Mukai pairing between polyforms is defined as
FORMULA 
where we select the top form.
The FORMULA  tensor is given by FORMULA . We define
the Hodge dual of a form as follows
FORMULA 
and the contraction of a top form (or the top form part of a polyform) with the FORMULA -tensor
FORMULA 
We introduce the following notation for
the contraction of a (poly)form with gamma matrices:
FORMULA 
For any form FORMULA  we have FORMULA  and in particular for the RR fields, using (REF ),
FORMULA .
Throughout the text we will use the above definitions for both the total ten-dimensional space-time FORMULA ,
as, mutatis mutandis, for the internal manifold six-dimensional FORMULA .

Spinors, ordinary & generalized
Ordinary spinors
With the compactification ansatz (REF ), the
ten-dimensional FORMULA -matrices decompose accordingly as
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  four-dimensional and FORMULA  six-dimensional gamma-matrices, and
FORMULA 
the corresponding four-dimensional and six-dimensional chirality operators. The ten-dimensional
chirality operator reads
FORMULA 
We impose the following Majorana condition in ten dimensions
FORMULA 
with FORMULA , where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are used to impose the Majorana conditions in four
and ten dimensions
FORMULA 
and satisfy the defining relations
FORMULA 


It also follows,
as required for consistency, that FORMULA .
Note that this consistency condition
does not allow for other choices of signs in (REF ). From (REF )
we find
FORMULA 
and, as again required for consistency,
FORMULA .
Note that if we define the usual charge conjugation matrix FORMULA  by
FORMULA 
and setting in addition FORMULA , we see that (REF ) can be
cast in more standard form FORMULA .
In ten dimensions there is another choice
for the matrix imposing the Majorana condition,
namely FORMULA . This would lead to the introduction of
the operator FORMULA  for the FORMULA , as seems to be the usual convention. We will not make this choice
here as it would not be compatible with our
spinor ansatz (REF ) for type IIA without some inconvenient sign changes.
A reflection in the FORMULA th internal direction is generated on spinors by
FORMULA 
and with the above reality condition (REF )
it converts Majorana spinors into Majorana spinors.
We note that FORMULA 
and FORMULA , so that if FORMULA  contains FORMULA  internal reflections
we have on spinors
FORMULA 
If FORMULA  we need to compensate in the orientifold projection with a factor of FORMULA ,
resulting in the choices of (REF ).

Generalized spinors
A generalized vector FORMULA  acts on
a polyform FORMULA  as
FORMULA 
Because this action satisfies FORMULA ,
with the natural FORMULA -signature metric defined as
FORMULA 
it makes FORMULA  into a Clifford algebra and FORMULA  into an FORMULA -spinor.
Two compatible pure spinors FORMULA  define a generalized metric FORMULA  (with FORMULA  an ordinary metric and FORMULA  a 2-form)
as follows. First we define the null spaces FORMULA  of FORMULA  and FORMULA  respectively,
i.e. FORMULA  if and only if FORMULA  and analogously for FORMULA , and their
complex conjugates FORMULA . Next we can define the spaces
FORMULA 
It is possible to show that the elements of FORMULA  and FORMULA  have the form
FORMULA 
with FORMULA . It is then easy to extract the sought for generalized metric FORMULA .
For the pure spinors defined from spinor bilinears as in (REF ), we find FORMULA .
In fact, in this picture the 2-form FORMULA  is completely absorbed in FORMULA  in (REF ).
The vectors of FORMULA  act as FORMULA  gamma-matrices on the left, while those of FORMULA  act on the right.
By making a FORMULA -transform on these pure spinors, FORMULA  with FORMULA ,
it is possible to switch to an alternative picture where FORMULA  in (REF ), while its information is completely contained
in the generalized metric FORMULA . We will not use the latter picture in this paper, because FORMULA  is generically
not globally defined, so that one needs to allow gauge transformations between local patches.
A number of useful properties of the spinor bilinears defined in (REF )
follow from the Fierz identity
FORMULA 
Note the reversal of the indices and the appearance of the factor 8 from tracing over the spinor
representation. Taking FORMULA  we find
that (REF ) can be explicitly expanded as follows
FORMULA 
Taking instead FORMULA  to be
FORMULA 


respectively, we find
FORMULA 


As a companion to (REF ) one can also define
FORMULA 
and show the following – which will be useful in demonstrating the equation of motion for FORMULA  –
FORMULA 


for any (poly)form FORMULA .
Furthermore, FORMULA  satisfy
FORMULA 
so that the generalized Calabi-Yau property
FORMULA 
is automatically obeyed
for FORMULA -spinors created as spinor bilinears. They are also automatically
pure and compatible.
In addition,
they satisfy the following duality properties
FORMULA 
Finally, using (REF ) it is straightforward to show the following reality properties
FORMULA 

Type II supergravity
The bosonic content of type II supergravity consists of a metric FORMULA , a dilaton FORMULA , an NSNS three-form FORMULA  and RR-fields
FORMULA . In the democratic formalism of {{cite:a3f02741-c838-4d10-9596-edfa8703f9ff}}, with double the number
of RR-fields, FORMULA  runs over FORMULA  in IIA and over FORMULA  in type IIB. In this paper FORMULA  will always indicate
the dimension of the RR-fields; for example FORMULA  stands for FORMULA  in type IIA and FORMULA  in type IIB.
After deriving the equations of motion from the action the redundant RR-fields can then be removed by hand
by means of the duality condition
FORMULA 
As in the above equation we will often collectively denote the RR-fields with the polyform FORMULA . We also have doubled
the RR-potentials, collectively denoted by FORMULA . In addition they
satisfy FORMULA .In the type IIA case with non-zero Romans mass parameter FORMULA  the
potentials are in fact defined by FORMULA . In particular FORMULA . Also the Chern-Simons term
in the D-brane action has to be
adjusted accordingly. One can check that this does not change the analysis of this paper.
Taking the compactification ansatz (REF ) into account,
the duality relation translates into
FORMULA 
The fermionic content consists
of a doublet of gravitino's FORMULA  and a doublet of dilatino's FORMULA .
The components of the doublet are of different chirality
in type IIA and of the same chirality in type IIB.
The supersymmetry variation of the gravitino and dilatino doublet are given by
FORMULA 


with
FORMULA 
The Einstein equation (in the string frame),
its trace, and the dilaton equation of motion,
including the contribution from the `Dirac-Born-Infeld' part of the calibrated sources, D-branes and orientifolds,
read
FORMULA 


with FORMULA .
Finally, the Bianchi identities and equations of motion
for the RR-fields, including the contribution from the `Chern-Simons' terms of the sources,
take the form
FORMULA 


and the equation of motion for  FORMULA
FORMULA 
Note that the last term in the above equation comes from the Dirac-Born-Infeld term of the sources, while a careful analysis reveals that the
Chern-Simons contribution cancels with a contribution from the RR part of the bulk action upon using ().

Conditions for FORMULA  compactifications to  FORMULA
We collect here the complete conditions for an FORMULA 
four-dimensional Minkowski background. The latter is described
by two complex polyforms FORMULA ,
whereas the (smeared or localized) sources are given by a real polyform FORMULA . Considered as spinors of the 12-dimensional
space FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  must be pure
i.e. their annihilator space must be maximal
(six-dimensional in the present case).
Every FORMULA  spinor and thus also FORMULA  can be written as a sum of pure spinors.
For each term the purity means that, roughly-speaking, it can be written as FORMULA 
with the FORMULA -form FORMULA  decomposable in one-forms – so that it can be interpreted as a single
D-brane or orientifold source. From a microscopic point of view one should require supersymmetry
for each of the sources, and thus the calibration constraints () for each individual
term.
The pure spinors FORMULA  and FORMULA  must satisfy
FORMULA 


See the discussion around (REF ) for the prescription for finding the metric FORMULA 
associated with both pure spinors. Note that one has to explicitly check
the positive-definiteness of this metric.
It follows from these conditions that the two (almost) generalized complex structures associated to
FORMULA  and FORMULA  are commuting and the structure is FORMULA .
These conditions, as well as
the condition of purity, are automatically satisfied in the case where FORMULA 
and FORMULA  are constructed from spinor bilinears as in (REF ).
The calibration conditions for each D-brane and orientifold plane (for the latter FORMULA ) read
FORMULA 


As shown in {{cite:5506d3c1-356f-4f98-a5f0-7f73bd4d4c57}}, {{cite:a0f3a16f-1500-4916-a752-78524dbe951e}}, for a localized D-brane source,
the calibration conditions are equivalent to the statement
that the source preserves the background supersymmetry (REF ). In addition,
they imply the equations of motion for the D-brane world-volume fields, provided one takes () into account.
In fact, supersymmetry will lead to the same equations also for smeared sources,
and then our argument that the supersymmetry conditions together with the form equations imply the
source-corrected Einstein and dilation equations holds regardless of whether the source is localized or smeared.
In addition, the differential supersymmetry conditions read:
FORMULA 


Finally we have the Bianchi identities for the form-fields:
FORMULA 


As shown in {{cite:ee881770-4ff1-4f65-be3b-a19e127b9f40}},
conditions () guarantee that the supersymmetry variation of
the gravitino and dilatino () vanish,
so the background is supersymmetric. They also imply the equations of motion
for FORMULA  and FORMULA  following section .
Moreover, as shown in section , conditions ()
together with the Bianchi identities () imply
that the Einstein equation and the dilaton equation of motion are satisfied –
even in the presence of sources – provided that the sources
satisfy the calibration conditions
().
As shown in {{cite:9cba5b0c-aa05-48fc-99a7-529d5a2b8cc3}},
equation () together with the Bianchi identities
leads directly to the no-go theorem.
Indeed, suppose that all FORMULA  and non-zero fluxes then
FORMULA 
It follows that at least one FORMULA , so we must have at least one orientifold.

Nilmanifolds
A nilmanifold has a basis of globally defined one-forms FORMULA , called left-invariant
one-forms, satisfying the Maurer-Cartan
relation
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  are the structure constants of the underlying nilpotent Lie-algebra.
The one-forms FORMULA  are not necessarily a vielbein, although a simple
choice for the vielbein FORMULA  (and corresponding metric) could indeed be (a warping of) FORMULA .
One can always make a nilmanifold compact
by dividing by a discrete group FORMULA . Moreover, when restricting to left-invariant structures,
i.e. structures with constant coefficients in the basis
of the left-invariant one-forms, the analysis does not depend on the choice of FORMULA .
For a nilpotent algebra, there is always a choice of FORMULA s
such that FORMULA  is integer and non-zero only if FORMULA . With such a choice,
notation such as FORMULA  stands for a nilmanifold with FORMULA ,
FORMULA , and all other FORMULA  zero (this is the Iwasawa manifold).
There are 34 isomorphism classes of six-dimensional, simply-connected, nilpotent Lie-groups, for which in
the present paper we use the
numbering of table 4 of {{cite:9cba5b0c-aa05-48fc-99a7-529d5a2b8cc3}}.
In the physics literature (compactified) nilmanifolds are also
called twisted tori, because they can be regarded as iterated torus bundles.
