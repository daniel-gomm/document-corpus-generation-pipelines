Abstract
We introduce the Cauchy augmentation operator for basic hypergeometric
series. Heine's FORMULA  transformation formula and Sears'
FORMULA  transformation formula can be easily obtained by the
symmetric property of some parameters in operator identities. The
Cauchy operator involves two parameters, and it
can be considered as a generalization of the operator FORMULA .
Using this operator, we obtain extensions of the Askey-Wilson
integral, the Askey-Roy integral, Sears' two-term summation formula,
as well as the FORMULA -analogues of Barnes' lemmas. Finally, we find
that the Cauchy operator is also suitable for the study of the
bivariate Rogers-Szegö polynomials, or the continuous big
FORMULA -Hermite polynomials.
Keywords: FORMULA -difference operator, the Cauchy
operator, the Askey-Wilson integral, the Askey-Roy
integral, basic hypergeometric series, parameter augmentation.

Introduction
In an attempt to find efficient FORMULA -shift operators to deal with
basic hypergeometric series identities in the framework of the
FORMULA -umbral calculus {{cite:7c97ec40-3461-4664-a2e0-5731ce301dd1}}, {{cite:18374130-1261-4aea-9a27-e2872bb19c2f}}, Chen and Liu
{{cite:0020dcd3-6988-472a-823f-4e5dc89e063d}}, {{cite:12b8597b-38e5-460b-832d-0e24a5d76e6c}} introduced two FORMULA -exponential operators for
deriving identities from their special cases. This method is called
parameter augmentation. In this paper, we continue the study of
parameter augmentation by defining a new operator called the Cauchy
augmentation operator which is suitable for certain transformation
and integral formulas.
Recall that Chen and Liu {{cite:0020dcd3-6988-472a-823f-4e5dc89e063d}} introduced the augmentation
operator
FORMULA 
as the basis of parameter augmentation which serves as a method for
proving FORMULA -summation and integral formulas from special cases for
which some parameters are set to zero.
The main idea of this paper is to introduce the Cauchy augmentation
operator, or simply the Cauchy operator,
FORMULA 
which is reminiscent of the Cauchy
FORMULA -binomial
theorem {{cite:5486bc6d-d6df-4133-a6d6-d0e9f96c9a06}}
FORMULA 
For the same reason, the operator FORMULA  should be named the
Euler operator in view of Euler's identity{{cite:5486bc6d-d6df-4133-a6d6-d0e9f96c9a06}}
FORMULA 
Compared with FORMULA , the Cauchy
operator (REF ) involves two parameters. Clearly,
the operator FORMULA  can be considered as a special case of the
Cauchy operator (REF ) for FORMULA . In order to utilize the
Cauchy operator to basic hypergeometric series, several operator
identities are deduced in Section . As to
the applications of the Cauchy operator, we show that many classical
results on basic hypergeometric series easily fall into this
framework. Heine's FORMULA  transformation formula
{{cite:5486bc6d-d6df-4133-a6d6-d0e9f96c9a06}} and Sears' FORMULA 
transformation formula {{cite:5486bc6d-d6df-4133-a6d6-d0e9f96c9a06}} can be
easily obtained by the symmetric property of some parameters in two
operator identities for the Cauchy operator.
In Section  and Section , we use the Cauchy operator to generalize the
Askey-Wilson integral and the Askey-Roy integral. In
{{cite:af65a861-7ed2-4941-88cf-9f3e1164d01f}}, Ismail, Stanton, and Viennot derived an
integral named the Ismail-Stanton-Viennot integral which took the
Askey-Wilson integral as a special case. It is easy to see that our
extension of the Askey-Wilson integral is also an extension of the
Ismail-Stanton-Viennot integral. In {{cite:c4b77d22-66ac-470f-bcfc-ee94be1e94a9}}, Gasper discovered
an integral which was a generalization of the Askey-Roy integral. We
observe that Gasper's formula is a special case of the formula
obtained by applying the Cauchy operator directly to the Askey-Roy
integral. Furthermore, we find that the Cauchy operator can be
applied to Gasper's formula to derive a further extension of the
Askey-Roy integral.
In Section , we present
that the Cauchy operator is suitable for the study of bivariate
Rogers-Szegö polynomials. It can be used to derive the
corresponding Mehler's and the Rogers formulas for the bivariate
Rogers-Szegö polynomials, which can be stated in the equivalent
forms in terms of the continuous big FORMULA -Hermite polynomials.
Mehler's formula in this case turns out to be a special case of the
nonsymmetric Poisson kernel formula for the continuous big
FORMULA -Hermite polynomials due to Askey, Rahman, and Suslov
{{cite:c92887bc-97fe-46e1-8d95-5308f1bc9eec}}. Finally, in Section  and Section , we employ the Cauchy
operator to deduce extensions of Sears' two-term summation formula
{{cite:5486bc6d-d6df-4133-a6d6-d0e9f96c9a06}} and the FORMULA -analogues of Barnes'
lemmas {{cite:5486bc6d-d6df-4133-a6d6-d0e9f96c9a06}}.
As usual, we follow the notation and terminology in
{{cite:5486bc6d-d6df-4133-a6d6-d0e9f96c9a06}}. For FORMULA , the FORMULA -shifted factorial is
defined by
FORMULA 
For convenience, we shall adopt the following notation for multiple
FORMULA -shifted factorials:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is an integer or infinity.
The FORMULA -binomial coefficients, or the Gauss coefficients, are given
by
FORMULA 
The (unilateral) basic hypergeometric series FORMULA  is defined
by
FORMULA 

Basic Properties
In this section, we give some basic identities involving the Cauchy
operator FORMULA  and demonstrate that Heine's FORMULA 
transformation formula and Sears' FORMULA 
transformation formula are implied in the symmetric property of some
parameters in two operator identities.
We recall that the FORMULA -difference operator, or Euler derivative, is
defined by
FORMULA 
and the Leibniz rule for FORMULA  is referred to
the following
identity
FORMULA 
The following relations are easily verified.
Proposition 2.1 Let FORMULA  be a nonnegative integer. Then we
have
FORMULA 

Now, we are
ready to give some basic identities for the Cauchy operator
FORMULA . We assume that FORMULA  acts on the parameter FORMULA .
The following identity is an easy consequence of the Cauchy
FORMULA -binomial theorem (REF ).
Theorem 2.2  We have
FORMULA 
provided FORMULA .

Proof.  By Proposition REF , the left hand side of (REF ) equals
FORMULA 
which simplifies to the right hand side of (REF )
by the Cauchy FORMULA -binomial theorem (REF ). FORMULA
Theorem 2.3  We have
FORMULA 
provided FORMULA .

Proof.  In view of the Leibniz formula for FORMULA , the left
hand side of (REF ) can be expanded as follows
FORMULA 
as desired.  FORMULA
Notice that when FORMULA , the FORMULA  series
on the right hand
side of (REF ) can be summed by employing the Cauchy
FORMULA -binomial theorem (REF ). In this case (REF ) reduces
to
FORMULA 
which was derived by Chen and Liu in {{cite:0020dcd3-6988-472a-823f-4e5dc89e063d}}.
As an immediate consequence of the above theorem, we see that
Heine's FORMULA  transformation formula {{cite:5486bc6d-d6df-4133-a6d6-d0e9f96c9a06}} is really about the symmetry in FORMULA  and FORMULA 
while applying the operator FORMULA .
Corollary 2.4 (Heine's transformation) We have
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .

Proof.  The symmetry in FORMULA  and FORMULA  on the
left hand side of (REF ) implies that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .
Replacing FORMULA  by FORMULA  in (REF ),
respectively, we may easily express the above identity in the form
of (REF ). FORMULA
Remark 2.5 A closer look at the proof of Theorem REF  reveals that
the essence of Heine's transformation lies in the symmetry of FORMULA 
and FORMULA  in Leibniz's formula (REF ).

We should note that we must be cautious about the convergence
conditions while utilizing the Cauchy operator. In general, it
would be safe to apply the Cauchy operator if the resulting series
is convergent. However, it is possible that from a convergent series
one may obtain a divergent series after employing the Cauchy
operator. For example, let us consider Corollary
REF . The resulting series (REF ) can be obtained by
applying the Cauchy operator FORMULA  to FORMULA 
which is convergent for all FORMULA . However, the resulting series on
the left hand side of (REF ) is not convergent for FORMULA .
Combining
Theorem REF  and the Leibniz rule (REF ), we obtain
the following identity which implies Theorem REF  by setting
FORMULA . Sears' FORMULA  transformation formula {{cite:5486bc6d-d6df-4133-a6d6-d0e9f96c9a06}} is also a consequence of Theorem REF .
Theorem 2.6 We have
FORMULA 
provided FORMULA .

Proof.  In light of Leibniz's formula, the left hand side of
(REF ) equals
FORMULA 
By Theorem REF , the above sum equals
FORMULA 
as desired.  FORMULA
Corollary 2.7 (Sears' transformation) We have
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .

Proof. 
Based on the symmetric property of the parameters FORMULA  and FORMULA  on the
left hand side of (REF ), we find that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .
Making the substitutions FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA , we get
the desired formula. FORMULA
We see that the essence of Sears' transformation also lies
in the symmetry of FORMULA  and FORMULA  in the application of Leibniz
rule.

An Extension of the Askey-Wilson Integral
The Askey-Wilson integral {{cite:f8a89134-a32e-4bb3-afac-10d3c23d36b1}} is a significant
extension of the beta integral. Chen and Liu {{cite:0020dcd3-6988-472a-823f-4e5dc89e063d}} presented
a treatment of the Askey-Wilson integral via parameter augmentation.
They first got the usual Askey-Wilson integral with one parameter by
the orthogonality relation obtained from the Cauchy FORMULA -binomial
theorem (REF ) and the Jacobi triple product identity
{{cite:5486bc6d-d6df-4133-a6d6-d0e9f96c9a06}}, and then they applied the
operator FORMULA  three times to deduce the Askey-Wilson integral
involving four parameters {{cite:3bf8e10a-2dea-48f3-b1fc-cf456c5c6e20}}, {{cite:af65a861-7ed2-4941-88cf-9f3e1164d01f}}, {{cite:c7aa1d86-e243-4a01-af8c-9192f4ceb62b}}, {{cite:52a0ba90-251b-490d-a479-5365eaf43d0d}}, {{cite:def6483d-80d0-4086-b558-1ede5d1966c1}}, {{cite:ad09aaaa-7459-40fa-b022-95ba8af8a2cf}}
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .
In this section, we derive an extension of the Askey-Wilson integral
(REF ) which contains the following
Ismail-Stanton-Viennot's integral {{cite:af65a861-7ed2-4941-88cf-9f3e1164d01f}} as a
special case:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .
Theorem 3.1 (Extension of the Askey-Wilson integral) We have
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .

Proof. 
The Askey-Wilson integral (REF ) can be written as
FORMULA 
Before applying the Cauchy operator to an integral, it is necessary
to show that the Cauchy operator commutes with the integral. This
fact is implicit in the literature. Since this commutation relation
depends on some technical conditions in connection with the
integrands, here we present a complete proof.
First, it can be easily verified that the FORMULA -difference operator
FORMULA  commutes with the integral. By the definition of FORMULA 
(REF ), it is clear that
FORMULA 
Consequently, the operator FORMULA  commutes with the integral.
Given a Cauchy operator
FORMULA , we proceed to prove that it commutes with
the integral. From the well-known fact
that, for a sequence of continuous functions FORMULA  on a
curve FORMULA , the sum commutes with the integral in
FORMULA 
provided that
FORMULA  is uniformly convergent.
It is
sufficient to check the convergence condition for the continuity is
obvious. This can be done with the aid of the Weierstrass M-Test
{{cite:8444c3d2-6d5d-4e43-9a1d-c15707ecc249}}. Using the Cauchy operator
FORMULA  to the left hand side of (REF ), we find that
FORMULA 
Let FORMULA  denote the integrand in the last line of the above
equation. We make the assumption FORMULA  so that, for FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
Now we rewrite the series FORMULA  into
another form FORMULA  in order to prove its
uniform convergence. In the proof of Theorem REF , one sees
that the
absolute convergence of the FORMULA  series under the condition
FORMULA 
implies the absolute convergence of the
sum
FORMULA 
Therefore, under the condition FORMULA , it follows from Theorem
REF  that
FORMULA 
Hence
FORMULA 
Now, let
FORMULA 
By the Weierstrass M-Test, it remains to find a
convergent series FORMULA , where FORMULA  is
independent of FORMULA , such that FORMULA . For
FORMULA , we may choose
FORMULA 
It is easy to see that FORMULA  is convergent when
FORMULA . It follows that the Cauchy operator commutes with the
integral in (REF ), so (REF ) can be written as
FORMULA 
Finally, we may come to the general condition FORMULA  by the
argument of analytic continuation. Hence, under the condition
FORMULA , we have shown that it is valid to
exchange the Cauchy operator and the integral when we apply the
Cauchy operator to (REF ).
Now, applying FORMULA  to (REF ) with respect to the
parameter FORMULA  gives
FORMULA 
where FORMULA . This implies the desired
formula. The proof is completed.  FORMULA
In fact, the above proof also implies the convergence of the
integral in Theorem REF . Once it has been shown
that the sum commutes with the integral, one sees that the integral
obtained from exchanging the sum and the integral is convergent.
Setting FORMULA  in (REF ), by the FORMULA -Gauss sum
{{cite:5486bc6d-d6df-4133-a6d6-d0e9f96c9a06}}:
FORMULA 
we arrive at the Ismail-Stanton-Viennot integral
(REF ).
Setting FORMULA  in (REF ),
by means of the FORMULA -Gauss sum (REF )
we find the following formula which we have not seen in the
literature.
Corollary 3.2 We have
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .


A Further Extension of the Askey-Roy Integral
Askey and Roy {{cite:bfe5a35a-f77b-4932-a0b2-478b8a8f576d}} used Ramanujan's FORMULA 
summation formula {{cite:5486bc6d-d6df-4133-a6d6-d0e9f96c9a06}} to derive the
following integral formula:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA , which is called
the Askey-Roy integral.
In {{cite:c4b77d22-66ac-470f-bcfc-ee94be1e94a9}}, Gasper discovered an integral formula
FORMULA 
provided FORMULA  and FORMULA , which
is an extension of the Askey-Roy integral. Note that Rahman and
Suslov {{cite:a7bd242e-3d89-4573-9069-d21a7f3f7953}} found a proof of Gasper's formula
(REF ) based on the technique of iteration with respect to
the parameters of FORMULA  in the integral
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the solution of a Pearson-type first-order
difference equation.
In this section, we first derive an extension of the Askey-Roy
integral by applying the Cauchy operator. We see that Gasper's
formula (REF ) is a special case of this extension
(REF ). Moreover, a further extension of the Askey-Roy
integral can be obtained by taking the action of the Cauchy
operator on Gasper's formula.
Theorem 4.1  We have
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA .

Proof.  As in the proof of the extension of the Askey-Wilson
integral, we can show that the Cauchy operator also commutes with
the Aksey-Roy integral. So we may apply the Cauchy operator
FORMULA  to both sides of the Askey-Roy integral
(REF ) with respect to the parameter FORMULA . It follows
that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Putting FORMULA  and FORMULA  in (REF ), by the FORMULA -Gauss sum
(REF ), we get the formula (REF ) due to Gasper.
In order to apply the Cauchy operator to Gasper's formula
(REF ), we rewrite it as
FORMULA 
The proof is thus completed by employing the operator FORMULA 
with respect to the parameter FORMULA  to the above identity. FORMULA
Replacing FORMULA , FORMULA  by FORMULA , FORMULA , respectively, and then taking
FORMULA  in (REF ), we are led to the following identity due to
Zhang and Wang {{cite:0090d4d1-b1b5-4567-8039-3f742040704a}}.
Corollary 4.2 We have
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA .


The Bivariate Rogers-Szegö
Polynomials
In this section, we show that Mehler's formula and the Rogers
formula for the bivariate Rogers-Szegö polynomials can be easily
derived from the application of the Cauchy operator.
The bivariate Rogers-Szegö polynomials are closely
related to the continuous big FORMULA -Hermite polynomials.
However, it seems that the following form of the
bivariate Rogers-Szegö polynomials are
introduced by Chen, Fu and Zhang {{cite:32e8855c-cd98-422b-8c05-fe6e35db7eca}}, as defined by
FORMULA 
where the Cauchy polynomials are given by
FORMULA 
which naturally arise in the FORMULA -umbral calculus. Setting FORMULA , the
polynomials FORMULA  reduce to the classical Rogers-Szegö
polynomials FORMULA  defined by
FORMULA 
It should be noted that Mehler's formula for the bivariate
Rogers-Szegö polynomials is due to Askey, Rahman, and Suslov
{{cite:c92887bc-97fe-46e1-8d95-5308f1bc9eec}}. They obtained the
nonsymmetric Poisson kernel formula for the continuous big
FORMULA -Hermite polynomials, often denoted by FORMULA . The formula
of Askey, Rahman, and Suslov can be easily formulated in terms of
FORMULA . Recently, Chen, Saad, and Sun presented an approach to
Mehler's formula and the Rogers formula for FORMULA  by using
the homogeneous difference operator FORMULA  introduced by Chen, Fu,
and Zhang. As will be seen, the Cauchy operator turns out to be more
efficient
compared with the techniques used in {{cite:1192a91e-42ed-4f91-9113-145650d4a2af}}.
We recall that the generating function of the bivariate
Rogers-Szegö polynomials
FORMULA 
where FORMULA , can be derived from the Euler identity
(REF )
using the Cauchy operator.
A direct calculation shows that
FORMULA 
From the identity (REF ), we can
easily establish the following lemma.
Lemma 5.1 
We have
FORMULA 

Applying FORMULA  to the Euler identity (REF ) with
respect to the parameter FORMULA , we get
FORMULA 
which leads to (REF ) by suitable substitutions.
The reason that we employ the Cauchy operator to deal with the
bivariate Rogers-Szegö polynomials is based on the following fact
FORMULA 
We are ready to describe how one can employ the
Cauchy operator to derive Mehler's formula and the Rogers
formula for FORMULA .
Theorem 5.2 (Mehler's formula for FORMULA )  We have
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .

Proof. 
By Lemma REF , the left hand side of (REF )
can be written as
FORMULA 
In view of the generating function (REF ), the above sum
equals
FORMULA 
where FORMULA . This completes the proof.
 FORMULA
We see that (REF ) is equivalent to {{cite:1192a91e-42ed-4f91-9113-145650d4a2af}} in terms of Sears' transformation formula
(REF ). Setting FORMULA  and FORMULA  in (REF ) and
employing the Cauchy FORMULA -binomial theorem (REF ), we obtain
Mehler's formula {{cite:0020dcd3-6988-472a-823f-4e5dc89e063d}}, {{cite:c7aa1d86-e243-4a01-af8c-9192f4ceb62b}}, {{cite:9140d5c8-8e59-4965-85b5-74bb7661269b}}, {{cite:bb47f70a-8b00-40e1-99f1-52e08f2aa0e6}} for the Rogers-Szegö polynomials.
Corollary 5.3 We have
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .

Theorem 5.4 (The Rogers
formula for FORMULA ) We have
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .

Proof.  Using Lemma REF ,
the left hand side of (REF ) equals
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
where FORMULA . FORMULA
Note that (REF ) is equivalent to {{cite:1192a91e-42ed-4f91-9113-145650d4a2af}} in terms of Heine's transformation formula
{{cite:5486bc6d-d6df-4133-a6d6-d0e9f96c9a06}}. Setting FORMULA  in
(REF ), by the Cauchy FORMULA -binomial theorem (REF ) we
get the Rogers formula {{cite:0020dcd3-6988-472a-823f-4e5dc89e063d}}, {{cite:9140d5c8-8e59-4965-85b5-74bb7661269b}}, {{cite:1c76f5b7-40de-4f14-8f98-8dde69261ab5}} for the
Rogers-Szegö polynomials.
Corollary 5.5 We have
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .


An Extension of Sears' Formula
In this section, we give an extension of the Sears two-term
summation formula {{cite:5486bc6d-d6df-4133-a6d6-d0e9f96c9a06}}:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .
From the Cauchy operator, we deduce the following extension of
(REF ).
Theorem 6.1 We have
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .

Proof. 
We may rewrite (REF ) as
FORMULA 
Applying the operator FORMULA  with respect to the parameter
FORMULA , we obtain (REF ). FORMULA
As far as the convergence is concerned, the above integral is of
the following form
FORMULA 
To ensure that the series (REF ) converges absolutely, we
assume that the following two conditions are satisfied:

FORMULA  converges to FORMULA , and FORMULA 
has a nonzero limit as
FORMULA .

FORMULA .

It is easy to see that under the above assumptions, (REF )
converges absolutely, since
FORMULA 
It is easy to verify the double summations in (REF ) satisfy
the two assumptions of (REF ), so the convergence is
guaranteed.

Extensions of FORMULA -Barnes' Lemmas
In this section, we obtain extensions of the FORMULA -analogues of
Barnes' lemmas. Barnes' first lemma {{cite:c54d534b-ee16-4729-9707-1c5795f807b9}} is an integral
analogue of Gauss'
FORMULA  summation formula.
Askey and Roy {{cite:bfe5a35a-f77b-4932-a0b2-478b8a8f576d}} pointed out that Barnes' first
lemma is also an extension of the beta integral. Meanwhile,
Barnes'
second lemma {{cite:9aa2ad10-005f-4c39-984b-02a32e4a2e3b}} is an integral analogue of
Saalschütz's formula.
The following
FORMULA -analogue of Barnes' first lemma is due to Watson, see {{cite:5486bc6d-d6df-4133-a6d6-d0e9f96c9a06}}:
FORMULA 
The FORMULA -analogue of Barnes' second lemma is due to Agarwal, see
{{cite:e93c670f-812f-4296-ba9d-59e562a90cc3}} and {{cite:5486bc6d-d6df-4133-a6d6-d0e9f96c9a06}}:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  for large
FORMULA . Throughout this section, the contour of integration always ranges from
FORMULA  to FORMULA  so that the increasing sequences of poles of
integrand lie to the right and the decreasing sequences of poles
lie to the left of the contour, see {{cite:5486bc6d-d6df-4133-a6d6-d0e9f96c9a06}}. In order to ensure that the Cauchy
operator commutes with the integral, we assume that
FORMULA .
We obtain the following extension of Watson's FORMULA -analogue of
Barnes' first lemma.
Theorem 7.1 We have
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .

Proof. 
Applying the operator FORMULA  to (REF ) with
respect to the parameter FORMULA , we arrive at (REF ).  FORMULA
Let us consider the special case when FORMULA .
The FORMULA  sum on the right hand side of
(REF ) turns out to be a FORMULA  sum and can be
summed by the FORMULA -Gauss formula (REF ). Hence we get the
following formula derived by Liu {{cite:7172072d-1e49-43f8-839f-da247665caa8}}, which is also an
extension of FORMULA -Barnes' first Lemma.
Corollary 7.2  We have
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .

Clearly, (REF ) becomes FORMULA -Barnes' first Lemma
(REF ) for FORMULA .
Based on Corollary REF , employing the Cauchy
operator again, we derive the following further
extension of FORMULA -Barnes' first Lemma.
Theorem 7.3 We have
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA .

We conclude this paper with the following extension of
Agarwal's FORMULA -analogue of Barnes' second lemma. The proof
is omitted.
Theorem 7.4 We have
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and
FORMULA  for large
FORMULA .
