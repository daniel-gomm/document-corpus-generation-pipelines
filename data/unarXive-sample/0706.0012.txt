We analyse the 30 October, 2004, X1.2/SF solar event that occurred in AR
10691 (N13 W18) at around 11:44 UT. Observations at 212 and 405 GHz of the
Solar Submillimeter Telescope (SST), with high time resolution (5 ms), show
an intense impulsive burst followed by a long-lasting thermal phase. EUV
images from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SOHO/EIT) are used to
identify the possible emitting sources. Data from the Radio Solar Telescope
Network (RSTN) complement our spectral observations below 15 GHz. During the
impulsive phase the turnover frequency is above 15.4 GHz. The long-lasting
phase is analysed in terms of thermal emission and compared with GOES
observations. From the ratio between the two GOES soft X-ray bands, we derive
the temperature and emission measure, which is used to estimate the free-free
submillimeter flux density. Good temporal agreement is found between the
estimated and observed profiles, however the former is larger than the latter.

Introduction
It is widely accepted that solar flares imply the release of large amounts
of energy, which go mainly in the acceleration of particles: electrons and
ions. The interaction of these particles with the medium, plasma and magnetic
field, produces radiation by very different mechanisms, which is observed at
Earth in a wide range of wavelengths. Of particular interest are electrons
moving along the magnetic lines and producing gyrosynchrotron emission
observed at microwaves and shorter wavelengths. Gyrosynchrotron emission of
mildly relativistic electrons is distributed in a broad continuum at high
harmonics of the fundamental frequency FORMULA , where FORMULA  is
the electron charge, FORMULA  the magnetic field strength, FORMULA  the electron mass
at rest and FORMULA  the speed of light. The maximum emission is centred around
FORMULA , with FORMULA  the electron Lorentz factor
{{cite:433a83aa-e8c9-49ae-8db2-9c7755e4d81c}}. Taking FORMULA  G, indicative values of FORMULA 
are between 2 and 5 for a 10 GHz photon. Observationally,
{{cite:f6002f90-c33f-403c-8a1f-af851ce22464}} found that the highest correlation between centimetric
wavelengths and hard X-rays (HXR) happens between 17 GHz and 80 keV; that is,
electrons with energies FORMULA  keV. Therefore, radio observations at shorter
wavelengths offer new insights to understand processes that involve high
energy electrons during solar flares, where current HXR detector technology
does not provide enough sensitivity and/or signal to noise ratios to observe
weak flares. Since 1999, the only submillimeter instrument dedicated to solar
observation is the Solar Submillimeter Telescope {{cite:c064a9d1-3bff-4101-903a-fd05b8300fa7}} operating at 212 and 405 GHz. From the theoretical
arguments given above, FORMULA  4 MeV electrons should produce the synchrotron
emission observed with SST.
In this work, we report the multiwavelength observations of the impulsive
and gradual phases of an X-class flare that occurred on 30 October, 2004. In
the following section we describe the instruments and data analysis. In Section
, we analyse the impulsive phase of the flare; while in
Section , we do the same for the gradual phase. Finally,
we give our concluding remarks.

Observations and principal characteristics of the event
The SST {{cite:c064a9d1-3bff-4101-903a-fd05b8300fa7}} is a radome enclosed 1.5 m single
dish antenna with room temperature receivers in a focal array: 4 at
212 GHz and 2 at 405 GHz, with 5 ms time resolution. On 30 October,
2004, SST was tracking AR 10691 (N13 W18) with its beam 5. In
Figure REF , we sketch the position of SST beams with
crosses on a 195 Å EUV image of EIT {{cite:9a1a4400-d552-4871-876d-585c41db7abb}};
the size of the crosses is equal to the HPBW. While beams 2, 3 and 4
(212 GHz) are round, beam 5 (405 GHz) has an elliptical shape, with
minor and major axes in the directions shown in the figure. Because of
the high atmospheric attenuation only two beams observed this event,
one at 212 GHz (beam 3) and one at 405 GHz (beam 5). Beams 1 (212 GHz)
and 6 (405 GHz) are not shown in the figure. Since only two beams
observed the event, we cannot use the multibeam technique
{{cite:5e4cb9fd-733e-41b8-9937-0466f458f36e}} to locate the centroid of emission.
Assuming that the radio source is coincident with the EUV bright loop
(see Fig. REF ), we correct the observed antenna temperature
at 212 and 405 GHz for the misalignment. During calibration the antenna
temperatures are also corrected for atmospheric attenuation. Finally,
the corrected antenna temperatures are converted to flux densities, FORMULA ,
using the well known formula: FORMULA , where FORMULA  is
the Boltzmann constant, FORMULA  the corrected antenna temperature and
FORMULA  the effective area of the antenna. We estimate a 40%
uncertainty for the whole process.
FIGURE 
FIGURE 
Data at microwave frequencies with 1 second time resolution were
obtained by the Radio Solar Telescope Network
{{cite:bfcb90cd-d845-48e8-91a4-69d9639db0ba}}. Figure REF  shows the
time profiles of the event at different wavelengths. At 15.4 GHz, we see
that the burst starts at 11:42:40 UT as a small enhancement that
evolves into the impulsive phase with a maximum flux density around
3300 s.f.u. at 11:44:09 UT. The increasing phase is characterized
by short emissions that can be attributed to different particle
injections. The decreasing phase is smooth, with no bursts, reaching
the minimum value (close to the pre-flare level) at 11:45:25 UT.
Afterward, a post burst increase is observed until approximately
11:51 UT. This gradual phase has also some bursting episodes
characteristic of particle injections.
Although the 212 GHz time profile is in general smoother than that
at 15.4 GHz, most of the features observed at 15.4 GHz are also present,
with smaller amplitude, at 212 GHz. The starting time of the burst at
212 GHz coincides with that at 15.4 GHz (11:42:40 UT), but the peak time
is delayed by 3 seconds (11:44:12 UT at 212 GHz). The gradual phase is also
present with sudden changes, probably, of instrumental origin. The 405 GHz
time profile during the rising phase is closer to the 15.4 GHz emission
than to the 212 GHz, is in general delayed in 6 seconds. The decaying phase
is more extended than in the other frequencies and shows the presence of
longer features, some of these features could have an atmospheric origin,
and do not allow us to clearly recognize the gradual phase.
Unfortunately, no HXR data are
available for this event. Instead, we have used the time derivative
of GOES 1.5 – 12 keV soft X-ray (SXR) channel with 3 seconds temporal
resolution to compare with the radio flux density. The sensitivity
of GOES is better than FORMULA  W mFORMULA , taking this value as the
flux uncertainty, the flux time derivative has
a mean uncertainty better than FORMULA  W mFORMULA  s
FORMULA  W mFORMULA  sFORMULA . The time derivative of GOES
channel 3 (bottom curve in Fig. REF ) mimics very well
the radio time profiles during the rising phase and is coincident in time,
but has two clear maxima, the first peaking in coincidence with the 15.4
GHz emission. We will show later that the second GOES time derivative peak,
still during the rising phase, is also present at the other frequencies,
but during their decaying phase. Finally, the decaying phase in this curve
lasts longer than the others and has some bursting episodes.
FIGURE 
We use the wavelet transform {{cite:d4d62fd1-3973-45fe-81b9-37760eeddbed}} to compare
the time profiles. Wavelets are very useful to discriminate the different
time scales in a time series. We have integrated our data to the lowest
time resolution, namely 3 seconds and applied the wavelet transform
implemented by {{cite:3c6afc9b-db14-4f7e-8b9f-885420740838}} based on a Morlet mother wavelet
with wavenumber 6. In Figure REF  each contour
represents a structure resolved by the transform with a characteristic
scale in the ordinates occurring at the time in the abscissas. We note
that for each frequency the minimum contour level plotted is much greater
than the signal uncertainty. We have overplotted the density flux at 15.4
GHz (dark thick curve), 212 GHz (light thick curve) and the time derivative
of the GOES flux (black thin curve). The dashed curve represents the cone-of-influence of the transformation, i.e., where the boundaries do not
affect the result. We observe that near peak time (11:44 UT) there are
three groups of structures with scales around 10–20 seconds. The first
one, a little before 11:44 UT, is observed at the three frequencies with no
appreciable delay between them. The second one, just after 11:44 UT is
present also at the three frequencies. The last one (FORMULA  11:44:30 UT) is
observed at 15.4 GHz and GOES time derivative. At 212 GHz, this structure
appears only after 11:44:40 UT. Other structures with longer duration are
also observed for the 40 seconds scale, around 11:45:50 UT and around
11:46:30 UT. In general, the wavelet transforms are similar for the
different frequencies, including the coincidence in time of the
characteristic features at the different scales. Time profiles do not
reflect this in a more evident way because the relative importance of the
pulses are different.

The impulsive phase
Figure REF  (left panel) depicts the time evolution of the
2.695 and 15.4 GHz emissions at the top, together with the temporal evolution
of the optically thick spectral index at the bottom. This index is determined
from the flux densities at 2.695, 4.995, 8.8 and 15.4 GHz. The index is
lower than 1 all along the impulsive phase. The spectral index of the
optically thick gyrosynchrotron spectrum originated in a homogeneous
source is between 2.5 and 2.9 {{cite:433a83aa-e8c9-49ae-8db2-9c7755e4d81c}}, independently of the
electron index. Therefore, our result is an indication of the presence of
an inhomogeneous source.
The 40 ms integrated time evolution of the flux density at 212 and 405
GHz during the impulsive phase is shown in the right panel of Figure
REF  (above). The bottom of this panel corresponds to the temporal
evolution of the optically thin spectral index deduced from these
flux densities, the only two frequencies that are optically thin in our
data. During the central part of the impulsive phase (between the dashed
lines in the right panel of the Fig. REF ), the index is close to
constant, with gradual transitions at the beginning and end. Therefore, we can
characterize the peak time with only one electron population. Using
Dulk's formula {{cite:433a83aa-e8c9-49ae-8db2-9c7755e4d81c}}, we can estimate the electron energy index as
FORMULA .
FIGURE 
The low spectral resolution of our radio data does not allow us
to obtain a unique theoretical fit of the spectrum, i.e. different sets
of parameters (magnetic field strength, viewing angle, source size,
lower and higher cutoff energies, etc.) give similar results for the
optically thin region; while, the optically thick region is never well
fitted, as expected when an inhomogeneous source is present.

The 212 GHz gradual phase
The gradual phase is observed very clearly at 212 GHz
(Fig. REF ). At lower frequencies, after the main burst,
new bursting episodes of gyroemission origin are seen.
Figure REF  shows the 15.4 GHz flux density, arbitrarily
shifted by 300 s.f.u., to clarify the plot; the late bursting episodes
are evident in this figure. The strongest 15.4 GHz feature is also
observed at 212 GHz (arrow in Fig. REF ). Variations in
the atmospheric attenuation and/or emission are relatively more intense
at 405 GHz than at 212 GHz, and thus they modulate the
background making the free-free emission difficult to observe.
FIGURE 
FIGURE 
FIGURE 
To test the thermal bremsstrahlung hypothesis we have modelled the
observed emission as an isothermal homogeneous bremsstrahlung source.
We integrate the flux densities at different frequencies in the 1
minute interval shown in Figure REF  with a label 'A' to
obtain the gradual spectrum. We have not tried to subtract the contribution
from other emission mechanisms, like gyrosynchrotron; therefore, we choose
an interval that does not show strong gyroemission. To determine the size
of the source we have used an image from the Solar X-ray Imager
{{cite:eeac5779-5ec9-4450-b8d8-91ccfe8eca81}}, {{cite:2aa0d418-5a80-4923-8689-972b4fba9f5c}}
(Fig. REF ), considering the emitting area above 30% of the
maximum, which yields a source size of the order of 40”. The emission
measure and temperature of the source are determined using the
Chianti-based model with coronal abundances and the response of GOES
detectors. We fit the expected emission to the observed data, having
as free parameters the source size and the source depth and we include
a multiplicative factor FORMULA . The time profile of the gradual
emission at 212 GHz must be fitted simultaneously. We have obtained the
best fit with a source size of 28”, FORMULA  cm depth and
FORMULA . Figures REF  and REF  show the
results. The temporal evolution of the model is remarkably similar to
the gradual phase of the 212 GHz emission. Moreover, the modelled
spectrum follows the observed one.
The homogeneous and isothermal thermal bremsstrahlung flux density,
FORMULA , is:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the absorption coefficient, FORMULA  is the depth of
the source and FORMULA  the source solid angle, while FORMULA  represents
the source temperature and FORMULA  is our multiplicative factor. The
absorption coefficient FORMULA  can be approximated by
{{cite:433a83aa-e8c9-49ae-8db2-9c7755e4d81c}}:
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  the thermal plasma density. In the optically thick
regime, where FORMULA , Eq. REF 
tends to:
FORMULA 
Therefore, if we want to explain the observed spectrum, the product FORMULA  of the microwave source must be a factor 7.5 larger. In the
optically thin regime, FORMULA , Eq. REF  turns out to be:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the emission measure, FORMULA  the volume of
the source and FORMULA  is the Sun - Earth distance. From
Eq. REF  we can infer that the product FORMULA 
must be a factor 7.5 larger; i.e. either the EM is larger or
the temperature is lower, or both things are true. Therefore, considering the
optically thick and optically thin regimes, we conclude that the source is
neither homogeneous nor isothermal. Similar results for the gradual phase
of other events were obtained by {{cite:6a37f40e-24a0-419f-b7ce-f3f597f321ca}} at submillimeter
wavelengths, and by {{cite:8a1fd072-0b73-4f68-9127-186675863690}} and {{cite:cb342932-5b03-4aed-8f8a-df5521923e19}} in
microwaves.

Conclusions
In this work we have presented a multiwavelength analysis of a GOES X1
class flare, including radio data, SXR and EUV images. Radio observations
cover the range between 1.4 and 405 GHz, but we have no observations
between 15.4 and 212 GHz. At 212 GHz, the event has two
distinct phases: impulsive and gradual. At microwave frequencies,
there is a second impulsive phase whose emission at submillimeter
frequencies is barely observed.
We find that the optically thin spectral index FORMULA  is almost
constant during the central part of the impulsive phase, afterwards there
is a hardening. A transition to free-free emission, that in the optically
thin regime has an almost null index, can explain the change of FORMULA .
The gradual phase observed at 212 GHz can be explained by bremsstrahlung
from a thermal source. The similarity of the temporal evolution of the
emission coming from an isothermal bremsstrahlung source (with FORMULA  and
FORMULA  deduced from SXR data) and the flux density at 212 GHz, sustains this
hypothesis. Nonetheless, either the FORMULA  must be higher or FORMULA  must
be smaller to fit the observations. On the contrary, to
fit to the microwave observations, the product FORMULA  must be
larger. Therefore, the thermal source cannot be homogeneous.
The use of submillimeter frequencies in the analysis of burst
phenomena opens new windows to understand the earlier stages of a
flare at high energies, which are hard to observe with HXR detectors,
and the late stages of the flare, where the thermal bremsstrahlung is
normally optically thin and more intense than at microwave frequencies.
