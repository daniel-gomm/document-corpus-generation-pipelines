The structures of globular clusters (GCs) reflect their dynamical
states and past histories. High-resolution imaging allows the exploration of
morphologies of clusters in other galaxies.
Surface brightness profiles from new Hubble Space Telescope observations
of 34 globular clusters in M31 are presented, together with fits of several different
structural models to each cluster.
M31 clusters appear to be adequately fit by standard King models, and do not
obviously require alternate descriptions with relatively stronger halos, such
as are needed to fit many GCs in other nearby galaxies.
The derived structural parameters are combined with corrected versions of
those measured in an earlier survey to construct a comprehensive catalog of
structural and dynamical parameters for M31 GCs with a sample size similar
to that for the Milky Way.
Clusters in M31, the Milky Way, Magellanic Clouds, Fornax dwarf
spheroidal and NGC 5128 define a very tight fundamental plane with
identical slopes.
The combined evidence for these widely different galaxies strongly reinforces the view that
old globular clusters have near-universal structural properties regardless of host
environment.
galaxies: star clusters — galaxies: individual (M31) — globular clusters: general
Introduction
Globular clusters (GCs) have long been recognized as unique dynamical laboratories
and unique markers of galaxy history. The integrated properties of GCs,
such as age and metallicity, are believed to reflect conditions in the early
stages of galaxy formation {{cite:1bb76fbb-a2b1-4fc8-a9dd-026a8bb0b092}}. The spatial structure and kinematics
of GCs reflect both their formation conditions and dynamical evolution within
the tidal fields of their host galaxies.
Structures of GCs as described by surface brightness or velocity profiles
can be fit by a number of different models. These models can be used to
compute numerous parameters describing various aspects of cluster structure,
but four independent parameters suffice to completely define a single-mass model. It is helpful
to think of cluster structures as being defined by spatial scale, spatial concentration,
total luminosity, and a relation between luminosity and mass, but
many different parameter choices are possible. {{cite:9a6fa58e-ac86-4278-bb68-5d1ea81d39f7}} and {{cite:61c4ed7e-9b09-4a39-905d-1f94c8e7fa45}} used formally
different, but entirely equivalent, sets of structural parameters to show that
globular clusters in the Milky Way do not occupy the full four-dimensional
parameter space but instead define a remarkably narrow `fundamental plane'.
The same appears to be true for clusters in M31 {{cite:eab5a78a-ebdf-485a-9313-8551d7af8a1c}}, {{cite:10f9cee3-2b8c-4116-b2af-c11fa84eea7f}}, {{cite:89200cb4-8d55-437a-802a-67e397dbf7fe}}, in NGC 5128 {{cite:ec66d18a-a660-4ba7-9aa0-134eccdeb714}},
and in M33 {{cite:fc154f50-c9c6-427f-8aaa-990189efaec4}}. This evidence indicates that the formation and evolution
processes for normal globular clusters were similar in a wide variety of environments {{cite:5a6d3f52-3512-42ee-8ec0-a6faf21c6bbc}}.
The globular cluster fundamental plane is similar in character, but different
in detail, to that of elliptical galaxies {{cite:321661fe-45a1-4fbe-8b9a-33739f932707}}.
There have been several suggestions that at least some of the most massive GCs in the Milky Way
and M31 are in fact the nuclei of destroyed dwarf galaxies {{cite:0ae99c55-ebe2-495a-bf3c-8a2db4e2baa4}}, {{cite:fb3dec07-f4f8-4bfe-b8e2-29600e7eeb2d}},
or that they are related to ultra-compact dwarf galaxies {{cite:b92e588c-14c6-457c-82d5-deda97acbab1}}. Both dwarf galaxy
nuclei and UCDs occupy somewhat different regions of the fundamental plane than do GCs,
but structural properties have been measured for only a few objects
in this transition mass region between globulars and galaxies.
Combining samples of clusters from a number of nearby galaxies—
where structures can be accurately measured with high-resolution imaging from the
Hubble Space Telescope (HST)— is a way to improve the sample statistics
particularly for the upper end of the GC mass range.
To further understand the globular cluster fundamental plane, we have carried out
a survey of massive globulars in M31 and
NGC 5128 using the HST Advanced Camera for Surveys {{cite:8160dca5-ad2e-41e6-9362-d3cfd0891ffe}}.
Other papers from this program discuss the NGC 5128 cluster sample {{cite:ab95b589-59d4-4a6a-8c08-d435b5c24bb0}},
the techniques for measurement of those clusters' structural parameters {{cite:4f1c8f8a-5adf-422d-bc4c-3e0b1936fab5}},
and the comparison between massive globulars, nuclear star clusters, and `dwarf-globular
transition objects' {{cite:c29a35ef-b6bb-4f9f-8a4c-c961b1b96d9a}}.
This paper presents the new M31 observations and structural parameters,
compiles a publicly-available catalog of measurements of structural parameters for
the largest-ever sample of M31 clusters, and compares the resulting `fundamental
planes' of globular cluster parameters in different galaxies.
Throughout this paper we assume a distance to M31 of 780 kpc (1 pc
subtends 026)
and use the cluster nomenclature of the Revised Bologna Catalogue {{cite:fd15bce7-318d-447b-a422-4b3e2d97f112}}.

Observational material
We have used material from several different HST programs.
Program GO-10260 (PI W. Harris) obtained ACS Wide Field Channel (WFC) images
centered on six clusters in M31
and twelve clusters in NGC 5128, selected to be those having FORMULA  and (for M31) no
previous HST observations. Exposure times were 2370 s (one orbit split into three dither positions)
in both the F606W and F814W filters.
Most of the GO-10260 M31 observations were made in the period 2004 September 29–2004 October 01.
Program GO-9719 (PI T. Bridges) obtained ACS High Resolution Channel (HRC) images of
three M31 clusters using
exposure times of 2020 s in F606W and 2680 s in F814W in 2003 August and September.
Program GO-8664 (PI W. Harris) targeted 24 M31 clusters with a range of properties
{{cite:ec66d18a-a660-4ba7-9aa0-134eccdeb714}}
for imaging with STIS in snapshot mode; exposure times were 480 s in the unfiltered
50CCD/CL imaging mode. These data were obtained in fall 2000 and winter 2001.
Of the 24 STIS targets, one (B329) is clearly a galaxy,
and two more (B391 and B340) had faulty coordinates and were not on the images.
Cluster B396 was bisected by the edge of the STIS image but the data
were still usable.
The cluster G001 (Mayall II) is one of the most massive in M31 and has been
the subject of numerous recent investigations. It is often likened to the Milky Way's
own massive cluster FORMULA  Cen; both clusters have been suggested as possible
remnant dwarf galaxy cores {{cite:0aec54ac-db4f-4420-aa9c-69bfe6f1b7de}}. There has been some discussion about
whether G001 contains a central black hole {{cite:5529fd87-4b4f-4117-b63f-284c9ddfd891}}, {{cite:297d03a5-012b-474f-89bd-166ac362cfc2}}, {{cite:22b3e1a5-882a-41a1-82fd-affc5a6bf109}} and
also some widely differing measurements of its structural parameters
{{cite:89200cb4-8d55-437a-802a-67e397dbf7fe}}. {{cite:22b3e1a5-882a-41a1-82fd-affc5a6bf109}} used new HST/ACS observations
of G001 (obtained as part of GO-9767) to produce a surface brightness profile
as part of an effort to constrain the mass of any putative central black hole,
but those authors did not give values for the cluster's structural parameters.
{{cite:73a8ede5-90a0-4873-a836-e0c4744d6338}} fit {{cite:180bd449-b0aa-4918-aa6a-a9400081904b}} models to the ACS data. Because of the importance
of G001, we decided to re-analyze
the {{cite:22b3e1a5-882a-41a1-82fd-affc5a6bf109}} observations, which consist of six exposures totaling 41 minutes of integration
time with the ACS HRC in the F555W filter.
The HST images offered the possibility of detecting new clusters or confirming
additional cluster candidates other than the targets.
All the M31 images were searched for additional clusters and inspected at the positions of cataloged cluster
candidates. A number of additional cluster candidates appeared in the
ACS images: B041, B056D, B061, B081D, B088D, B090, B102, B147, B162 and M027.
We also (independently) re-discovered the new cluster B515 reported by {{cite:fd15bce7-318d-447b-a422-4b3e2d97f112}}.
All of these candidates appear to be clusters except for B102, which
is apparently a star.{{cite:fd15bce7-318d-447b-a422-4b3e2d97f112}} independently came to the same conclusions about the
nature of B056D, B102, and B162.
Interestingly, B147, which had been classified as a star based on velocity
dispersion measurements by {{cite:10f9cee3-2b8c-4116-b2af-c11fa84eea7f}}, is clearly a resolved cluster
(see Figure REF ). This object is also associated with an X–ray source
{{cite:848f4e9d-77bf-4bb6-a2f8-8358f99540b5}}.
Figure REF  shows images of B147 and the highly elliptical cluster B088
demonstrating the power of HST imaging for resolving M31 globular clusters.
To generate the largest possible sample of M31 globulars for fundamental plane
analysis, we also include most of the clusters with structural parameters measured
from images taken with HST's Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WPFC2), reported
in {{cite:89200cb4-8d55-437a-802a-67e397dbf7fe}}. The clusters from {{cite:89200cb4-8d55-437a-802a-67e397dbf7fe}} included in
the present sample include 59 objects with HST/WFPC2 photometry in the
FORMULA -band and good measurements of FORMULA  and FORMULA .
The central surface brightness values for these clusters have had an important error corrected.
As also discussed in {{cite:4f1c8f8a-5adf-422d-bc4c-3e0b1936fab5}}, the software used to
fit structural models in {{cite:89200cb4-8d55-437a-802a-67e397dbf7fe}} and also {{cite:ec66d18a-a660-4ba7-9aa0-134eccdeb714}} did not return
a model central surface brightness value; instead both papers reported
FORMULA  as the surface brightness of the central pixel of
the PSF-convolved model image. As such, the values reported in
{{cite:89200cb4-8d55-437a-802a-67e397dbf7fe}} are systematically too faint. We re-computed
FORMULA  from the {{cite:180bd449-b0aa-4918-aa6a-a9400081904b}} FORMULA  and FORMULA  values reported in
{{cite:89200cb4-8d55-437a-802a-67e397dbf7fe}} and the integrated FORMULA  magnitudes reported in {{cite:2e212299-2607-48c5-a197-bafd12b1f5b5}} or {{cite:ff64dcf0-da15-4d82-b2eb-ffa1309a59ba}}.
The median surface brightness change is FORMULA  mag,
with a large scatter. The maximum change is about 1.5 mag, and
there were several clusters, both bright and faint, whose central
surface brightnesses were nearly unchanged in the re-calculation.
Using the model-fitting software of both {{cite:4f1c8f8a-5adf-422d-bc4c-3e0b1936fab5}} and {{cite:89200cb4-8d55-437a-802a-67e397dbf7fe}}
on a small number of M31 clusters showed that both recovered the
the same FORMULA  and FORMULA  values to within the uncertainties, so the two sets of
measurements should be consistent.
To summarize, the new observations include 15 clusters observed using the ACS in either
the Wide Field or High-Resolution Channel, in both F606W and F814W filters;
and 19 clusters observed in the unfiltered mode using STIS.
The observations of cluster G001 with ACS/HRC in the F555W filter are not new
but are re-analyzed here.
There are therefore 50 surface-brightness profiles for 34 distinct objects
(one of the STIS clusters, B023, is also in the ACS
sample and has thus been observed three times).
Adding the 59 objects from {{cite:89200cb4-8d55-437a-802a-67e397dbf7fe}}, the sample of M31 clusters
totals 93 objects, with some later omitted from the fundamental plane
analyses (see § REF ). Estimates of the total size of
the M31 GCS vary: one recent value is FORMULA  {{cite:ff64dcf0-da15-4d82-b2eb-ffa1309a59ba}}.
Thus the HST sample comprises only a fraction of the total M31 population, but
it is comparable in size to the full sample of non-core-collapsed
Milky Way clusters considered by {{cite:61c4ed7e-9b09-4a39-905d-1f94c8e7fa45}}, and about 10% larger than
the sample of 85 Milky Way clusters analyzed by {{cite:adb9445d-e9e9-48be-822b-94d4f636012e}}.
We have not attempted to generate a complete sample of clusters observed
with HST by searching the Archive for clusters serendipitously
observed in data taken after the {{cite:ff64dcf0-da15-4d82-b2eb-ffa1309a59ba}} sample was compiled;
however we expect that the present sample should be representative of M31 GCs
particularly at the high-luminosity end. The exception is low-surface-brightness
clusters for which our present analysis method is unsuitable: these include
both faint clusters, some discussed in the following section, and also the
`extended luminous' clusters discovered by {{cite:04c1882a-2033-4fac-862d-3249a76b852a}}
(see also §REF ).

Data analysis
The data analysis procedures used for these data are described in detail by
{{cite:4f1c8f8a-5adf-422d-bc4c-3e0b1936fab5}}. Here the procedures are briefly summarized, and
some details specific to the M31 observations noted.
Surface Brightness Profiles
The STScI-pipeline output drizzled images were used to
measure cluster shapes with ELLIPSE in IRAF.
Cluster center positions were fixed at values derived by centroiding and elliptical
isophotes were fit to the data, with no sigma-clipping.
A first pass of ELLIPSE was run in the usual way, with
ellipticity and position angle allowed to vary with the isophote semi-major axis.
Luminosity-weighted averages of ellipticity and position angle were
determined from the results. In the second pass of ELLIPSE,
surface brightness profiles on fixed, zero-ellipticity isophotes
were measured (this was required because we chose to fit circular models
for both the intrinsic cluster structure and the PSF).
For several low-density clusters (B290 and B423 observed with STIS;
B081D, B088D, B515, and M027 observed with ACS),
a sensible, monotonically-decreasing profile could not be obtained:
no models were fit to these clusters.
Table  reports the average ellipticities, position angles,
and aperture magnitudes measured from the ACS and STIS images, and tabulates some additional
reference data (metallicity, reddening, galactocentric distance) for all of the M31 clusters.
For 11 of the clusters, there are no metallicity estimates in
the literature, so we have simply assigned FORMULA  to all of
them (the mean and standard deviation of the metallicity
distribution of the M31 GC system; {{cite:2e212299-2607-48c5-a197-bafd12b1f5b5}}).
The raw output from ELLIPSE is in units of FORMULA  per pixel,
which is converted to FORMULA  per square arcsecond by multiplying by
FORMULA  for WFC, FORMULA  for HRC,
or FORMULA  for STIS.
To transform the ACS counts to surface brightness calibrated on the
VEGAMAG system (from the ACS Handbook)
FORMULA 
where the zeropoints are FORMULA  for HRC/F555W, WFC/F606W,
HRC/F606W, WFC/F814W, and HRC/F814W respectively.
The STIS data were taken in unfiltered (“clear” or CL)
mode, for which {{cite:ec66d18a-a660-4ba7-9aa0-134eccdeb714}} derive
FORMULA 
in the standard FORMULA  bandpass.
We allow for the occasional over-subtraction of sky in the
automatic reduction pipeline, and hence “negative” counts in some pixels, by
working in terms of linear intensity instead of surface brightness in
magnitudes. Givenhttp://www.ucolick.org/~cnaw/sun.html
FORMULA , FORMULA ,
and FORMULA , the calibration above yields
FORMULA 
Converting from luminosity density in
FORMULA  to surface brightness is done according to
FORMULA 
for F814W;
FORMULA 
for F606W;
FORMULA 
for standard FORMULA  and F555W.
The ELLIPSE profiles extended to FORMULA  pc
from all images of the sample clusters, and thus in the model
fitting a constant-background term is included to allow for any errors in
sky subtraction in the automatic pipeline. Each profile was inspected, and
one or two very discrepant points in each of a handful of clusters were
excluded by hand.
Inspection of the data quality images for the WFC images showed that, due to
an unfortunate choice of CCD gain, the cores of several bright clusters
(B042, B063, B082, B147, and B151) were saturated, with raw intensities
above a nominal limit of 70 cts sFORMULA  pixFORMULA  (28,000 cts sFORMULA  arcsecFORMULA ,
or FORMULA )
all the way out to FORMULA  pc (or FORMULA  pix) in most cases.
This is well beyond the
FWHM of the WFC PSF in either F606W or F814W; see below. Intensities as high
as this were not included in the model fitting, and thus the core
parameters of these five clusters are constrained only very indirectly.
None of the HRC or STIS images is saturated.
Table  gives the final, calibrated intensity profiles for all clusters.
These are not corrected for extinction, which is discussed below.
The reported F606W-
and F814W-band intensities are calibrated on the VEGAMAG scale, while the
STIS data are on the standard FORMULA  system.
The final column gives a flag for every point, which can
take one of four values.
“BAD” indicates that the intensity value is deemed dubious because
it strongly deviates from its neighbors or is obviously affected by nearby
bright stars or image artifacts.
“SAT” indicates that the isophotal intensity is above
the imposed saturation limit of 70 cts sFORMULA  pixFORMULA 
“DEP” indicates that the radius is inside FORMULA  and the isophotal
intensity is dependent on its neighbors. The ELLIPSE output
includes brightnesses for 15 radii inside 2 pixels, but these are all measured
from the same 13 central pixels and are clearly not statistically independent.
To avoid excessive weighting of the central regions of the
cluster in the fits, only intensities at radii
FORMULA , were used.
“OK” indicates that none of the above apply and the point is used in model fitting.

Point-Spread Functions
M31 clusters are clearly resolved with HST, but their observed core
structures are still affected by the PSF. We chose not to deconvolve
the data, instead convolving the structural models with a simple analytic
description of the PSF before fitting.
To estimate the PSF for the WFC, ELLIPSE was used (again with circular symmetry
enforced) to produce intensity profiles out to radii of about 2
(40 pixels) for a number of isolated stars on a number of images, and combined
them to produce a single, average PSF. This was done separately for
the F606W and F814W filters.
We originally tried to fit these with simple Moffat profiles (with backgrounds
added), but found that a better description was given by a function of the form
FORMULA 
The derived FORMULA  and FORMULA  values, and the implied FWHMs, are listed in Table
.
Although the WFC PSF is known to vary over the instrument's field of view,
{{cite:4f1c8f8a-5adf-422d-bc4c-3e0b1936fab5}} show that the model-fitting results are insensitive to this effect.
For HRC data, the same functional form (eq.REF ) was fitted to the
PSF images in F555W, F606W and F814W given by {{cite:9412e628-ca89-4985-9721-9c00c2457a40}} with
the results also listed in Table .
In the case of STIS, a similar procedure was followed {{cite:ec66d18a-a660-4ba7-9aa0-134eccdeb714}}
and it was found that a standard Moffat function,
FORMULA ,
gives an adequate fit to
the PSF, with parameters also listed in Table
. These are the functions convolved with the structural
models before fitting to the observed intensity profiles.

Extinction and Color Corrections
The effective wavelengths of the ACS F606W and F814W filters are
FORMULA  Å and FORMULA  Å {{cite:4354820f-34f6-4c55-9b07-1cb224859e6d}},
so that from {{cite:174a0949-1c3e-482a-995c-865d2266f0d1}} FORMULA  and
FORMULA —both of which are also found by
{{cite:4354820f-34f6-4c55-9b07-1cb224859e6d}}. This implies, rather conveniently, that
FORMULA . Individual reddening estimates—the sum of
foreground and M31-internal reddening—are available for most
of the clusters in the sample, derived using the procedure described by
{{cite:2e212299-2607-48c5-a197-bafd12b1f5b5}}. The {{cite:f016ea50-bbbd-4529-bea9-7a6866a54db5}} foreground value of
FORMULA  mag is adopted for clusters without individual measurements.
{{cite:4354820f-34f6-4c55-9b07-1cb224859e6d}} give transformations from ACS F606W and F814W magnitudes to
standard FORMULA  and FORMULA  for both WFC and HRC measurements, including linear and
quadratic dependences on de-reddened FORMULA  color (their Tables 22 and
23). However, measured FORMULA  is not available
for 5 of the 15 clusters in the present ACS sample, and thus
we chose instead to measure aperture FORMULA  colors from the current
data, and manipulate the {{cite:4354820f-34f6-4c55-9b07-1cb224859e6d}} relations to find FORMULA  and
FORMULA  indices.
Comparing the various “observed” and “synthetic” transformations from
intrinsic FORMULA  magnitudes and FORMULA  colors to FORMULA  mags in
{{cite:4354820f-34f6-4c55-9b07-1cb224859e6d}}, it quickly becomes clear that there are systematic differences
between them, at the level of FORMULA  mag in the color range
FORMULA  appropriate for old clusters with sub-solar
metallicities. However, a simple linear relation,
FORMULA 
both gives a good estimate of the average
of the {{cite:4354820f-34f6-4c55-9b07-1cb224859e6d}} relations (for VEGAMAG F606W magnitudes) and
agrees very well with the predictions for old clusters in the
population-synthesis models of {{cite:7375ac23-faad-4d25-b8da-78360452d00a}}, {{cite:f58824e1-ce62-4938-a722-1a5dbc6626b3}}. [VEGAMAG FORMULA 
and FORMULA  indices were kindly computed for us, as functions of cluster
age and metallicity, by C. Maraston.]
To go further, VEGAMAG FORMULA  magnitudes must be related to FORMULA .
All of the WFC and HRC transformations in {{cite:4354820f-34f6-4c55-9b07-1cb224859e6d}} imply that
FORMULA  to within FORMULA  mag or so, while the
population-synthesis models of {{cite:f58824e1-ce62-4938-a722-1a5dbc6626b3}} have a roughly constant
FORMULA  for FORMULA . Substituting
FORMULA  for FORMULA  in equation (REF ) yields
FORMULA 
and then trivially,
FORMULA 
both with estimated rms scatter of about FORMULA  mag. These
conversions were applied to both WFC and HRC data, after correcting the
calibrated FORMULA  and FORMULA  magnitudes/intensities for extinction.
Calibrating the other observations onto the standard FORMULA  scale
was more straightforward. The ACS/HRC F555W filter is similar to
the standard FORMULA  filter, and the data for G001 were calibrated using
the extinction ratio and transformation given by
{{cite:4354820f-34f6-4c55-9b07-1cb224859e6d}} (their Tables 15 and 23).
The data for the 19 STIS clusters are already calibrated on the
standard FORMULA  scale {{cite:ec66d18a-a660-4ba7-9aa0-134eccdeb714}}, as are the WFPC2 data from {{cite:ff64dcf0-da15-4d82-b2eb-ffa1309a59ba}}.
The reddening values used to correct for
extinction are recorded in Table .
Given the color transformations above, the measured ACS aperture colors
plus the assumed reddening values allow us to predict a reddened FORMULA  color
to be compared with ground-based aperture colors.
For the 10 of 15 ACS-observed clusters with FORMULA  colors
{{cite:2e212299-2607-48c5-a197-bafd12b1f5b5}},
the agreement between predicted and observed FORMULA 
colors is very good: the mean offset is FORMULA  mag, with a
median absolute deviation of 0.06 mag.
The cluster B023 has been observed in all three bandpasses discussed here: F606W
and F814W with ACS/HRC, and FORMULA  with STIS. The fits of {{cite:180bd449-b0aa-4918-aa6a-a9400081904b}} models
to these three independent profiles in § yield
extinction-corrected total magnitudes of FORMULA , FORMULA , and
FORMULA , with uncertainties of about FORMULA  mag in each. The implied
global FORMULA  is essentially identical to the
aperture color computed from the measurements in Table , and the
fitted global FORMULA  and FORMULA  are within 0.1 mag of the
predicted values—suggesting a level of agreement similar
to that between FORMULA  and FORMULA  more generally.
The cluster B041 is somewhat unusual. Its integrated colors
suggest that it is perfectly average, compared to the rest of the M31 cluster
system. However, the ACS image shows that a very bright, red star about
05 from the cluster center is responsible for the redness of its
FORMULA  and FORMULA  aperture colors.
Both the innermost intensities from the ELLIPSE profiles and the total cluster FORMULA  and
FORMULA  magnitudes from model fitting (in which the star is “smoothed
over” in some sense), imply a de-reddened
FORMULA  —much bluer than any other cluster in the sample.
In fact, the population-synthesis model predictions of
C. Maraston suggest that the oldest possible age for such a blue cluster is
FORMULA  Gyr. Because of its red integrated color, this cluster is not
included in any of the `massive young M31 cluster' samples of {{cite:86261dcb-e406-4fa3-9926-63a950d7bda0}} —
showing that integrated properties are not always
reliable guides to the true nature of extragalactic globular clusters.
There are eight clusters in the WFPC2 sample which are members of
`blue luminous compact cluster' samples `A' or `B' in {{cite:86261dcb-e406-4fa3-9926-63a950d7bda0}}.
These are suspected of being young clusters by virtue of very blue colors
[FORMULA ] or strong HFORMULA  absorption. These clusters and B041
are not included in any of the fundamental plane correlations in §REF ;
a total of 84 M31 clusters are considered there.

Models
Converting luminosity-based parameters from the model fits
into mass-based quantities requires knowledge of mass-to-light ratios.
Velocity-dispersion measurements do exist for a fraction of the sample (see §REF )
but the measurements are far from complete or uniform.
Instead, as in {{cite:4f1c8f8a-5adf-422d-bc4c-3e0b1936fab5}}, we use population-synthesis
models to predict mass-to-light ratios for the full sample,
using the code of {{cite:3cc597c6-3705-4c06-8dda-6ff25e218a19}} and assuming the (disk) stellar IMF of {{cite:290a10b5-02b9-4175-bc06-13b884ff72c9}}.
These can then be used to produce (for example) predicted velocity dispersions that can be
compared to current and future spectroscopic data.
The values of FORMULA  for an assumed age of 13 Gyr
are discussed further and tabulated in §REF 
and shown as a histogram in Figure REF .
For comparison, also shown is the (re-normalized to the same sample size)
distribution of mass-to-light ratios for 85
Galactic globulars with parameters cataloged by {{cite:adb9445d-e9e9-48be-822b-94d4f636012e}}, calculated using the same population-synthesis
model code with the same assumed stellar IMF and for the same assumed age of
13 Gyr as in the present analysis. The distribution peaks at a
slightly higher value of FORMULA  in M31 vs. the Milky Way,
which simply reflects a slightly higher average GC metallicity in the sample
of M31 clusters.
The cluster structural models used in the fits are described in detail
by {{cite:4f1c8f8a-5adf-422d-bc4c-3e0b1936fab5}}. The three models considered here are the often-used
{{cite:180bd449-b0aa-4918-aa6a-a9400081904b}} single-mass, isotropic, modified isothermal sphere;
an alternate modification of a single-mass, isotropic isothermal
sphere, based on a model originally introduced by {{cite:c04595a7-3d20-40d2-8ffc-66f8258a6030}} for elliptical
galaxies; and the {{cite:f86c0ebf-8843-475d-93da-c6b86fcf23a7}} or FORMULA  model.
{{cite:c04595a7-3d20-40d2-8ffc-66f8258a6030}} models are similar to the standard {{cite:180bd449-b0aa-4918-aa6a-a9400081904b}} models,
in that their cores are nearly isothermal, but their envelope structures are
relatively more extended—a feature that has been found to better describe the
density profiles of old globulars and young massive clusters in the Local
Group and in NGC 5128. See {{cite:adb9445d-e9e9-48be-822b-94d4f636012e}} and {{cite:4f1c8f8a-5adf-422d-bc4c-3e0b1936fab5}} for more detailed
discussion and for general comparisons between the two types of models.
Two additional models, `power-law' profiles and the analytic {{cite:4a695301-0723-4fde-a21d-bf6619075086}} model, are
found by {{cite:4f1c8f8a-5adf-422d-bc4c-3e0b1936fab5}} to provide little or no information beyond that contained in
the first three models, and are not discussed here.
Fitting the structural models to the data involves first
selecting a value for FORMULA , the scale radius,The definition of FORMULA  varies between models: for {{cite:f86c0ebf-8843-475d-93da-c6b86fcf23a7}} models,
FORMULA , while for {{cite:180bd449-b0aa-4918-aa6a-a9400081904b}} and {{cite:c04595a7-3d20-40d2-8ffc-66f8258a6030}}
this relation is only approximate. See {{cite:4f1c8f8a-5adf-422d-bc4c-3e0b1936fab5}} for details.
and computing the
dimensionless model profile FORMULA .
The model is then convolved with the appropriate PSF
having parameters taken from Table  to yield
the product FORMULA . The fitting procedure allows
for a varying scale radius FORMULA  and non-zero background FORMULA , and so minimizes
FORMULA 
for the measured intensity profile FORMULA  and uncertainties FORMULA  of each cluster in
Table .
Uncertainties on the fitted and derived model parameters are estimated in
the usual way, from the range of their values in all
models for which FORMULA  is within some specified distance of the absolute
minimum (e.g., FORMULA  for 68% confidence intervals).
Because the formal error bars estimated by ELLIPSE for the isophotal intensities are
artificially small, the best-fit FORMULA  can be exceedingly
high (FORMULA ) even when a model fit is actually very good.
This would result in unrealistically small estimates of parameter uncertainties.
We chose to re-scale the FORMULA  for all fitted models by a common factor chosen to make
the global minimum FORMULA , where FORMULA 
is the number of points used in the model fitting. Under this re-scaling, the global
minimum reduced FORMULA  per degree of freedom is exactly one.
This prescription for deciding fit uncertainties does not affect the identification
of the best-fitting model itself, since the relative sizes of the uncertainties on
individual data points are not changed.

Results
Model-fitting
Figure REF  shows example surface brightness profiles and model fits
for four M31 clusters chosen to span the observed luminosity range.
The observed data plotted have had the fitted FORMULA  subtracted
and then been converted to (extinction-corrected) surface brightnesses.
Points with intensities below the subtracted background in the upper panel are
represented here as solid points placed on the lower FORMULA -axis, with error bars
extending upwards. The Figure shows that the M31 GCs are well-resolved by
the HST imaging, and also demonstrates the core saturation for the brightest
clusters exemplified by B151. For these particular clusters there is relatively little
difference in the goodness-of-fit of the three different models. As expected,
the {{cite:c04595a7-3d20-40d2-8ffc-66f8258a6030}} models, with their extended halos, favor somewhat lower background
levels, and the `cuspier' {{cite:f86c0ebf-8843-475d-93da-c6b86fcf23a7}} models favor higher central surface brightnesses.
The clusters have projected half-light radii FORMULA  pc and King-model
concentrations in the range 1–1.5, quite typical values for GCs in both M31 {{cite:89200cb4-8d55-437a-802a-67e397dbf7fe}}
and the Milky Way {{cite:a1acc265-01a8-475f-89b1-fd8a1c5e4b16}}.
Table  summarizes the basic ingredients of all model fits to the
full sample. The first column
in this table gives the cluster name; the second, the detector/filter
combination from which the density profile was derived;
the third, the extinction in the F606W band;
the fourth, the color term to transform photometry from the native bandpass of
the data to the standard FORMULA  scale (see §REF ),
and the fifth column lists the number of points in the intensity profile
that are flagged as OK in Table  above, and thus were
used to constrain our model fits.
Subsequent columns in Table  cover three lines for each
cluster, one line for each type of model fit. Column (6) identifies the model.
Column (7) gives the minimum unreduced FORMULA  obtained for that class
of model (without the re-scaling applied for uncertainty estimation).
Column (8) gives the best-fit background intensity.
Column (9) gives the dimensionless central potential FORMULA  of the best-fitting
model (for {{cite:180bd449-b0aa-4918-aa6a-a9400081904b}} and {{cite:c04595a7-3d20-40d2-8ffc-66f8258a6030}} models only).
Column (10) gives the concentration FORMULA , or
the {{cite:f86c0ebf-8843-475d-93da-c6b86fcf23a7}} index FORMULA  of the best fit.
Column (11) gives the calibrated and extinction-corrected central surface
brightness in the native bandpass of the data.
Column (12) gives the logarithm of the best-fit scale radius FORMULA  in
arcsec (see §), and Column (13) gives the logarithm of FORMULA 
in units of pc (obtained from the angular scale assuming FORMULA  kpc for M31).
Error bars on all these parameters were defined in the same way as {{cite:4f1c8f8a-5adf-422d-bc4c-3e0b1936fab5}}.

Derived quantities
Table  contains a number of other structural cluster
properties derived from the basic fit parameters. The details of their
calculation are given in {{cite:4f1c8f8a-5adf-422d-bc4c-3e0b1936fab5}}; the contents are:

FORMULA , the model tidal radius in pc (always
infinite for {{cite:f86c0ebf-8843-475d-93da-c6b86fcf23a7}} models)

FORMULA , the projected core radius of the model
fitting a cluster, in units of pc

FORMULA , the projected half-light, or effective, radius of a model:

FORMULA , a measure of cluster concentration

FORMULA , the logarithm of the best-fit central (FORMULA ) luminosity surface
density in the FORMULA  band, in units of  FORMULA

FORMULA , the logarithmic central (FORMULA ) luminosity volume density in the FORMULA  band

in units of  FORMULA

FORMULA , the logarithm of the total integrated model
luminosity in the FORMULA  band

FORMULA 
is the total, extinction-corrected apparent FORMULA -band magnitude of a
model cluster

FORMULA  is the FORMULA -band
luminosity surface density averaged over the half-light/effective radius, in
units of FORMULA .

The uncertainties on all of these derived parameters have been
estimated (separately for each given model family) following the FORMULA 
re-scaling procedure described above.
The re-computed values for the 59 clusters from {{cite:89200cb4-8d55-437a-802a-67e397dbf7fe}}, for {{cite:180bd449-b0aa-4918-aa6a-a9400081904b}}
models only, are reported at the end of this Table.
Table  next lists a number of “dynamical” cluster
properties derived from
the structural parameters already given plus a mass-to-light ratio.
The first two columns of this table contain the name of each cluster and the
combination of detector/filter for the observations. Column
(3) lists the mass-to-light ratio, in solar units, adopted for
each object from the analysis in §.
The values of FORMULA  assume an age of 13 Gyr for all clusters.
The error bars on FORMULA  in Table  include
a FORMULA -Gyr uncertainty in age, as well as the previously tabulated
uncertainties in [Fe/H]. The remaining entries in Table 
are, for the best fit of every model type to every cluster:

FORMULA , the
integrated model mass in solar units, with FORMULA  taken from Column (10)
of Table 

FORMULA , the integrated binding energy in ergs, defined through
 FORMULA

FORMULA , the central surface mass density in units of  FORMULA

FORMULA , the central volume density in units of FORMULA 
(for {{cite:f86c0ebf-8843-475d-93da-c6b86fcf23a7}} models the density at the 3-D radius FORMULA )

FORMULA , the surface mass density averaged over the effective radius FORMULA ,
in units of  FORMULA

FORMULA , the predicted line-of-sight velocity
dispersion at the cluster center (or at FORMULA  for {{cite:f86c0ebf-8843-475d-93da-c6b86fcf23a7}} models), in km s FORMULA

FORMULA , the predicted central “escape” velocity in
km s FORMULA

FORMULA , the two-body relaxation time at the model
projected half-mass radius, in years

FORMULA ,
a measure of the model's central (at FORMULA  for {{cite:f86c0ebf-8843-475d-93da-c6b86fcf23a7}} models)
phase-space density or relaxation time, in units of
FORMULA .
For FORMULA  in these units, and FORMULA  in years, FORMULA 
{{cite:adb9445d-e9e9-48be-822b-94d4f636012e}}.

The uncertainties in these derived dynamical quantities are estimated from
their variations around the minimum of FORMULA  on the model grids,
as above, combined in quadrature with the uncertainties in the
population-synthesis model FORMULA .
Finally, Table  provides the last few parameters
required to construct the fundamental plane of globular clusters in M31
under any of the equivalent formulations of it in the literature (see
§REF  below). The last three columns of Table 
are modified versions of the “FORMULA ” parameters of {{cite:544f9c83-3574-4ff0-a526-71e707fe0907}},
who found that early-type galaxies and (separately) globular clusters
defined the edges of planes in FORMULA  space. We define the parameters
using mass rather than luminosity surface density, as this is more useful
for comparing globulars to younger clusters and galaxies {{cite:c29a35ef-b6bb-4f9f-8a4c-c961b1b96d9a}},
and emphasize this by using the notation FORMULA .
FORMULA 
In calculating FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA  for Table
, the FORMULA  predicted
in Table  (Column 7) by adoption of
population-synthesis mass-to-light ratios has been used, and FORMULA  evaluated
by adding FORMULA  to FORMULA  from Column
(12) of Table . (This means FORMULA  is therefore
independent of the assumed mass-to-light ratio.) FORMULA  is also taken
from Table  but put in units of kpc rather than pc, for
compatibility with the galaxy-oriented definitions of {{cite:544f9c83-3574-4ff0-a526-71e707fe0907}}.

Predicted Velocity Dispersions
One use for the material presented in the previous subsections is to predict
observable, line-of-sight velocity dispersions averaged over circular
apertures of any radius, which can then be compared directly to extant and
forthcoming spectroscopic data on the clusters in the
sample. Ultimately such comparisons will be useful not only for independent
assessments of the self-consistency of the structural model fits, but
also to evaluate how close the dynamical mass-to-light ratios in these old
globulars come to the expectations of population-synthesis models with no dark
matter.
Given any of the models with a fitted FORMULA  and FORMULA  or FORMULA  for any
cluster, solving Poisson's and Jeans' equations and projecting along
the line of sight yields a dimensionless velocity-dispersion
profile, FORMULA  as a function of projected clustercentric radius FORMULA . The
density-weighted average of FORMULA  within a
circular region of radius FORMULA  then gives a dimensionless
aperture dispersion for the cluster. Finally, normalizing with the
predicted FORMULA  from the fits in Table , we can
predict an observable FORMULA  for every model
for every cluster, and for any specified FORMULA . Table  gives
the results of these calculations for each of 5 apertures: FORMULA , and FORMULA . For a
distance of 780 kpc to M31, a typical GC FORMULA –4 pc translates
to roughly 08–11, so the range of apertures over which
FORMULA  is calculated should be a good match to reasonable
observations. The velocity dispersion inside other apertures
can be obtained by interpolation.
These predicted velocity dispersions can already be compared
in a limited way to observations.
Measured velocity dispersions for 29 M31 GCs, of which 22 are included in
the current HST sample,
are available from from {{cite:a6d0d495-649a-4c9d-88e2-a1f065fcd525}}, {{cite:10f9cee3-2b8c-4116-b2af-c11fa84eea7f}}, {{cite:eab5a78a-ebdf-485a-9313-8551d7af8a1c}}, and {{cite:52138fe6-f1c4-41b4-8391-f32bfbd237e3}}.
These are summarized in Table .
Figure REF  compares observed and model-predicted
velocity dispersions, where the model predictions are derived from
interpolation on the values in Table  to the aperture
size reported for the observations.
Aperture sizes were computed as FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the reported spectrograph slit dimensions.
Figure REF  shows that, except for a constant ratio, there is
generally good agreement between observed and predicted velocity dispersions
(the exception, cluster B037, is discussed further in §REF ).
This justifies our use of population synthesis model
mass-to-light ratios to derive masses and other properties such as binding energy.
This procedure gives us a much larger sample
of clusters to work with for a wider variety of analyses than would be possible
using only direct velocity dispersion measurements. The median ratio
between observed and predicted velocity dispersions is
FORMULA , with an inter-quartile range
FORMULA .
This corresponds to an ratio between dynamical and population-synthesis-derived
mass-to-light ratios of FORMULA ,
consistent with the value for this ratio of FORMULA  found by {{cite:adb9445d-e9e9-48be-822b-94d4f636012e}}
for Milky Way and old Magellanic Cloud clusters.
The lower dynamical mass-to-light ratios compared to those derived from
population-synthesis models is consistent with with theoretical expectations
that old Milky Way and M31 GCs have lost low-mass stars through evaporation,
an effect not included in the models.

Comparison of Fits in F606W and F814W
Comparing model fits to the same cluster observed in different filters allows
assessment of the systematic errors and color dependencies in the fits.
Figure REF  compares the
parameters derived from fits to the 15 ACS clusters observed in both F606W and F814W.
In general the agreement is quite good, with somewhat higher scatter for the
{{cite:c04595a7-3d20-40d2-8ffc-66f8258a6030}} and {{cite:f86c0ebf-8843-475d-93da-c6b86fcf23a7}} model fits than for the {{cite:180bd449-b0aa-4918-aa6a-a9400081904b}} fits.
There are a few unsuccessful fits with very high concentrations, small sizes
and extremely bright central surface brightnesses: the {{cite:180bd449-b0aa-4918-aa6a-a9400081904b}} model fit to B082 in F606W;
{{cite:c04595a7-3d20-40d2-8ffc-66f8258a6030}} model fit to B042 in F606W and B063 in F814W; and the {{cite:f86c0ebf-8843-475d-93da-c6b86fcf23a7}} model
fit to B147 in F814W. These are all clusters in which the central core data are
not used due to saturation; fortunately the data in the other filter produce
a more reasonable-looking fit. For all three models, the central FORMULA -band surface brightnesses
as fit to the F814W data are slightly fainter than those from the
F606W data, while the total model luminosities are essentially the same.
The latter implies that our estimated FORMULA  and FORMULA  colors in
§REF  are correct, while the former implies that the cluster
centers are slightly bluer than the average cluster color. This could indicate
the presence of blue stragglers or blue horizontal branch stars
in these massive clusters, but it could also
be due to the differing levels of saturation.
A broader range of data will be needed
to investigate the issue of color gradients in M31 GCs more thoroughly
{{cite:57457a5e-c287-427f-8547-73ae90b68632}}.
Because the model fit results in the two ACS bands are quite similar, and also
because for the STIS and WFPC2 data we have only FORMULA -band data, we do
not consider the F814W model fits in the following analyses.
Parameters derived from the model fits given in Tables –
refer to the F606W band observations only. The exception
is B082, where we substitute the F814W fit results for the {{cite:180bd449-b0aa-4918-aa6a-a9400081904b}} fit.

Comparison to previous results for individual clusters
The famous M31 cluster G001 has discrepant published values of its half-light
radius {{cite:89200cb4-8d55-437a-802a-67e397dbf7fe}}, {{cite:3b34e06d-7cda-41c9-8a14-02106a93be04}}, which was a major motivation for re-analyzing
it in this paper.
{{cite:0aec54ac-db4f-4420-aa9c-69bfe6f1b7de}} reported a three-dimensional FORMULA , which converts to a projected
FORMULA , while {{cite:89200cb4-8d55-437a-802a-67e397dbf7fe}} measured FORMULA  and {{cite:d1d05c62-fc3f-44bb-b3c8-dd11a6988df4}}
FORMULA .{{cite:77e63577-d26a-4c47-8fc0-a6582e866ef6}} pointed out that the integrated photometry given by {{cite:0aec54ac-db4f-4420-aa9c-69bfe6f1b7de}}
implies a half-light radius of about 118, much closer to
other values.
Our {{cite:180bd449-b0aa-4918-aa6a-a9400081904b}} model fits to the ACS/HRC F555W data resulted in a
half-light radius FORMULA , and our {{cite:c04595a7-3d20-40d2-8ffc-66f8258a6030}} fit to the same data
yielded FORMULA . The {{cite:0aec54ac-db4f-4420-aa9c-69bfe6f1b7de}} value is clearly the outlier,
likely because it is for the half-mass, rather than the half-light radius,
and because the {{cite:0aec54ac-db4f-4420-aa9c-69bfe6f1b7de}} analysis used multi-mass {{cite:180bd449-b0aa-4918-aa6a-a9400081904b}} models.
The surface brightness profile from the HRC observations is almost identical
to that presented in {{cite:0aec54ac-db4f-4420-aa9c-69bfe6f1b7de}}, which combined data from WFPC2 observations
including those used by {{cite:d1d05c62-fc3f-44bb-b3c8-dd11a6988df4}}, so we conclude that the physical model
assumptions used are responsible for the differences between authors.
Recently, {{cite:73a8ede5-90a0-4873-a836-e0c4744d6338}} also analyzed the ACS/HRC data used here: these authors derived
a higher concentration FORMULA  compared to our {{cite:180bd449-b0aa-4918-aa6a-a9400081904b}} model value of 1.77,
and a value of FORMULA  about twice as large as ours.
This appears to be the result of weighting
the outermost points in the surface brightness profile more heavily,
yielding a larger tidal radius and higher concentration.
The dashed line in {{cite:73a8ede5-90a0-4873-a836-e0c4744d6338}}'s Figure 3, which represents their
model fit with the outermost surface brightness points excluded, is
quite similar to our model fit, and we believe this to be more robust
particularly in the better-defined inner part of the cluster.
The heavily-reddened M31 cluster B037 has also been the subject of
intensive study. {{cite:3b34e06d-7cda-41c9-8a14-02106a93be04}} analyzed the same F606W image of B037 discussed
here, fitting a {{cite:4a695301-0723-4fde-a21d-bf6619075086}} model to a surface brightness profile made
from a PSF-deconvolved image. They derived a core radius FORMULA , half-light
radius FORMULA , concentration FORMULA ,
and central surface brightness FORMULA  mag arcsecFORMULA  in F606W
[using our values for extinction and FORMULA  color, this becomes FORMULA .]
Our model fits generally result in a somewhat higher concentration
and smaller core radius [FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  for the {{cite:180bd449-b0aa-4918-aa6a-a9400081904b}} model].
This relatively small change would not likely have affected {{cite:3b34e06d-7cda-41c9-8a14-02106a93be04}}'s
conclusions about the nature of this cluster.
{{cite:0f058d48-87ed-4aa9-a13e-0994e95390a5}} predict a velocity dispersion of 72 km sFORMULA 
for B037, on the basis of a mass estimate of FORMULA .
However, these FORMULA  and FORMULA 
values are based on a population-synthesis FORMULA  ratio applied to an
intrinsic cluster luminosity obtained by assuming a distance of FORMULA  kpc
to M31, instead of our adopted 780 kpc (and a large FORMULA  close to
the one we have used). Thus, comparison of their numbers with
ours requires first multiplying their derived mass by FORMULA .
In addition, the {{cite:0f058d48-87ed-4aa9-a13e-0994e95390a5}} mass and velocity dispersion are actually
calculated for what the cluster would have been at an age of 10 Myr.
However, the same population-synthesis models that they (like us)
used—i.e., {{cite:3cc597c6-3705-4c06-8dda-6ff25e218a19}}—show that the cumulative effects
of supernova explosions, massive-star winds, and AGB mass loss over 12–13 Gyr
lead to a reduction of the 10-Myr total cluster mass by another factor
of FORMULA  at its current, old age {{cite:8c81a036-85cc-4ad3-84d2-bd5ea2053fb1}}.
Therefore, the present-day mass of B037
implied by the work of {{cite:0f058d48-87ed-4aa9-a13e-0994e95390a5}} is in fact FORMULA ,
in good agreement with our results here (Table ).
The high velocity dispersion predicted for B037 by {{cite:0f058d48-87ed-4aa9-a13e-0994e95390a5}} is a `global'
(not central) value following from the virial theorem assuming both their
high mass and a rough estimate of the cluster half-light radius (FORMULA  pc in their analysis), which is significantly smaller than that in our
more accurate profile fitting (FORMULA  pc; e.g., Table , column 5).
Scaling to a 3-times smaller present-day mass, as above, and to a
FORMULA -times larger FORMULA , the expected global velocity dispersion following
self-consistently from Ma et al. is 72 km sFORMULA  km sFORMULA ,
which is then entirely consistent with our predicted FORMULA 
inside the largest apertures in Table .
{{cite:a6d0d495-649a-4c9d-88e2-a1f065fcd525}} has measured a velocity dispersion of FORMULA  km sFORMULA 
for B037 within an aperture of FORMULA  arcsec. Our predicted
dispersion within this aperture follows from interpolation on Table :
FORMULA  km sFORMULA . This factor-of-two discrepancy (which
implies a factor-of-four discrepancy between the true cluster mass and
that estimated from our de-reddened total luminosity and 13-Gyr old
population-synthesis FORMULA  ratio) could be resolved by
lowering the mass-to-light ratio, but reducing FORMULA  by a factor
of 4 would require imply an age for B037 of only a few Gyr, in conflict with the SED-fitting
results. Reducing the reddening of B037 to FORMULA  would yield a total
luminosity in better agreement with the measured FORMULA , but this
would also conflict with the {{cite:0f058d48-87ed-4aa9-a13e-0994e95390a5}} SED-fitting. The only viable
resolution appears to be the suggestion by {{cite:a6d0d495-649a-4c9d-88e2-a1f065fcd525}} that the dust
lane projected across the face of the cluster {{cite:3b34e06d-7cda-41c9-8a14-02106a93be04}}
distorts measurements of extinction from integrated photometry.
This should be testable with color profiles and star-count analysis from
the ACS images. Such analysis is beyond the scope of the present paper,
and the properties of B037 computed using FORMULA  are used in our
subsequent analysis.

Quality of Fit for Different Models
{{cite:adb9445d-e9e9-48be-822b-94d4f636012e}} and {{cite:4f1c8f8a-5adf-422d-bc4c-3e0b1936fab5}} give detailed discussions of the differences between various
cluster models and their applicability to GCs in galaxies other than M31.
Which structural model best represents the M31 clusters? Figure REF 
compares the FORMULA  values for the model fits as a function of cluster size
FORMULA  and total (model) luminosity FORMULA . The difference between models is parameterized
as
FORMULA 
which is independent of the FORMULA  re-scaling; significantly better fits
of one model over another are signaled by FORMULA .
In general, {{cite:180bd449-b0aa-4918-aa6a-a9400081904b}} models
fit the M31 cluster data better than {{cite:c04595a7-3d20-40d2-8ffc-66f8258a6030}} or {{cite:f86c0ebf-8843-475d-93da-c6b86fcf23a7}} models.
Cluster size does not strongly affect FORMULA , but luminosity does:
{{cite:180bd449-b0aa-4918-aa6a-a9400081904b}} models are more strongly preferred for more luminous M31 clusters.
The preference for {{cite:180bd449-b0aa-4918-aa6a-a9400081904b}} models for M31 clusters differs
from results using the same profile-fitting software for
for clusters in the Milky Way, Magellanic Clouds, and Fornax dSph
{{cite:adb9445d-e9e9-48be-822b-94d4f636012e}} and NGC 5128 clusters {{cite:4f1c8f8a-5adf-422d-bc4c-3e0b1936fab5}}, where
{{cite:c04595a7-3d20-40d2-8ffc-66f8258a6030}} models fit as well as or better than than {{cite:180bd449-b0aa-4918-aa6a-a9400081904b}} models.
The results for M31 clusters do not appear to depend on
the image saturation for some clusters — the clusters observed with ACS/HRC,
where saturation was not a problem, were also better-fit with {{cite:180bd449-b0aa-4918-aa6a-a9400081904b}} models.
The fitting procedure returned higher background levels for M31 clusters than those in NGC 5128, but
the background value does not correlate with FORMULA .
Figure REF  compares the values of cluster
parameters derived from {{cite:180bd449-b0aa-4918-aa6a-a9400081904b}} and {{cite:c04595a7-3d20-40d2-8ffc-66f8258a6030}} model fits.
The parameters do not clearly vary with goodness-of-fit,
and even the major outliers are not always much better fit with one model or the other.
The mean offsets between parameters derived
for the same cluster from {{cite:180bd449-b0aa-4918-aa6a-a9400081904b}} and {{cite:c04595a7-3d20-40d2-8ffc-66f8258a6030}} models are
comparable to the rms scatter, and only slightly larger than the typical
parameter uncertainties:
FORMULA , FORMULA ,
FORMULA , and FORMULA .
Small-scale systematic differences between the models (for example,
{{cite:c04595a7-3d20-40d2-8ffc-66f8258a6030}} models, which have more extended halos, always return fainter central
surface brightnesses FORMULA  than {{cite:180bd449-b0aa-4918-aa6a-a9400081904b}} models) do not affect
the global cluster parameters, such as the binding energy FORMULA  and
total luminosity FORMULA . These are very similar in all three of {{cite:180bd449-b0aa-4918-aa6a-a9400081904b}}, {{cite:c04595a7-3d20-40d2-8ffc-66f8258a6030}}
and {{cite:f86c0ebf-8843-475d-93da-c6b86fcf23a7}} models.
We suspect that the preference for {{cite:180bd449-b0aa-4918-aa6a-a9400081904b}} over {{cite:c04595a7-3d20-40d2-8ffc-66f8258a6030}} models is
due to some more subtle feature of the observational data that we have not yet been able to isolate,
rather than an intrinsic difference
between M31 clusters and those in other galaxies. However, since a majority of the M31
clusters have parameters derived only with {{cite:180bd449-b0aa-4918-aa6a-a9400081904b}} model fits, we use these
models as the basis for the fundamental plane analysis presented in §REF .
We do not expect the following discussion to depend on the model choice.

Discussion
We now combine the M31 GC parameters newly derived in the previous section
with those for clusters in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds {{cite:adb9445d-e9e9-48be-822b-94d4f636012e}}
and NGC 5128 {{cite:4f1c8f8a-5adf-422d-bc4c-3e0b1936fab5}} to form a large sample of GCs that have been
analyzed in a nearly homogeneous way. The sample comprises
291 clusters in six galaxies, an unprecedentedly large sample for defining
the GC fundamental plane.
In the following analysis, cluster luminosities are derived from the model fits
to the surface photometry rather than integrated or aperture measurements.
For the M31 and NGC 5128 clusters, model and measured luminosities are found to have excellent
correspondence, while for Milky Way and Magellanic Cloud clusters, discrepancies
between model and measured luminosities are often attributable to the measurement
aperture being smaller than the clusters' full size {{cite:adb9445d-e9e9-48be-822b-94d4f636012e}}.
Where M31 clusters are compared with NGC 5128 clusters from {{cite:4f1c8f8a-5adf-422d-bc4c-3e0b1936fab5}},
the 27 clusters omitted from that analysis are also omitted here.
As discussed above, {{cite:180bd449-b0aa-4918-aa6a-a9400081904b}} model parameters are adopted for clusters
in all galaxies.
Ellipticity distribution
There are several possible explanations for the elongation of globular clusters:
{{cite:77e63577-d26a-4c47-8fc0-a6582e866ef6}} lists elongation as possibly resulting from galaxy tides,
internal rotation, cluster mergers {{cite:93ec48a0-e7ec-4a90-92b7-aa8538ea9484}}
and `remnant elongation' (due to accretion?) from some clusters' former lives as
dwarf galaxy nuclei.
The latter two mechanisms would seem to be applicable to only a small
fraction of clusters, probably the more massive one. They could be related to the
observations that the most luminous young and old
LMC clusters tend to be more flattened, and that
the brightest globular clusters in both the Milky Way and M31 are also the most
flattened {{cite:06a78532-ceca-4e24-bed5-9490c5915265}}, {{cite:ab7495f7-e85f-415f-83f3-cf5afffc7504}}.As discussed in §REF , there is some controversy about whether
G001 or B037 is the most luminous M31 GC, but both are quite elliptical.
Measurement of GC ellipticities is an uncertain business particularly
for faint clusters: the shape of
outer isophotes is affected by the galaxy background light and low
signal-to-noise. For the extragalactic clusters measured with ELLIPSE,
very low values of ellipticity are disfavored because the ELLIPSE algorithm
diverges at FORMULA . With these caveats in mind, it is still
worthwhile to explore ellipticity distributions and correlations with other
parameters for clues to the origin of GC flattening.
Testing the idea that GC elongation is due to galaxy tides can be done to some
extent by comparing the ellipticities of clusters in different galaxies, and
thus different dynamical environments. Figure REF  shows the
distribution of ellipticities for clusters in the Milky Way {{cite:a1acc265-01a8-475f-89b1-fd8a1c5e4b16}}, M31 (this work),
and NGC 5128 {{cite:ab95b589-59d4-4a6a-8c08-d435b5c24bb0}}.
Compared to Figure 7 of {{cite:ec66d18a-a660-4ba7-9aa0-134eccdeb714}}, the number of M31 clusters is about 10%
larger (although the sample is somewhat different and includes more very luminous clusters);
the number of NGC 5128 clusters is about 3 times larger and the distribution
of their ellipticities somewhat more skewed to lower values.
The distributions of ellipticities for M31 and NGC 5128 are not statistically
different; both differ from the Milky Way distribution in having few very round clusters
(likely an artifact of the measurement technique).
The bottom panel of the Figure shows the distribution of ellipticity with
galactocentric position: no correlation is evident.
From this comparison there is no clear evidence for major differences in ellipticity
distribution between the three different galaxies' GCs, and thus no evidence that the overall
galaxy environment is a major factor.
If cluster ellipticities are caused by internal processes such as rotation
or velocity anisotropy, then relaxation through dynamical evolution should act
to reduce any initial flattening {{cite:28d9f9e7-b823-4f33-93e6-253ba2467f32}}. More dynamically-evolved clusters might be
expected to be rounder (although the relaxation time is long in the outer
regions of clusters which heavily influence measured ellipticity).
Figure REF  shows
ellipticity as a function of luminosity and half-mass relaxation time for clusters
in the three galaxies.
A mild systematic decrease in FORMULA  with increased FORMULA  is visible, though with considerable
scatter; measurements of very large ellipticities for clusters with
low luminosities are more likely to be spurious.
While the observation of {{cite:ab7495f7-e85f-415f-83f3-cf5afffc7504}} that the most luminous clusters in M31 and the Milky Way
are highly elliptical remains true, it is clear that all three galaxies also have very luminous clusters
which are quite round: did these bright, round clusters simply have less angular momentum at formation?
Or are they the `true' globular clusters while the more flattened luminous clusters
are remnant dwarf galaxy nuclei somehow flattened while being removed from their original
galaxies? Further modeling of the dwarf galaxy stripping process might help to answer this question.
No correlation of FORMULA  with the more important dynamical quantity FORMULA  is evident:
the data do not appear to favor the contention that more evolved clusters are rounder.
While primordial angular momentum still seems to be the most straightforward
explanation for GC ellipticity, the observed distribution appears to be due to
a number of factors.

Correlations with position and metallicity
Structures of GCs in the Milky Way have been shown to be largely independent of
galactocentric distance and metallicity {{cite:2ed68725-9edd-47a6-9b5d-9c6be70813e0}}, {{cite:9a6fa58e-ac86-4278-bb68-5d1ea81d39f7}}, {{cite:61c4ed7e-9b09-4a39-905d-1f94c8e7fa45}}, except for
the correlation of half-light radius with FORMULA  first noted by {{cite:8f506f06-64a7-40ac-be92-c438824f39e8}}.
Studies of cluster
structures in nearby galaxies {{cite:89200cb4-8d55-437a-802a-67e397dbf7fe}}, {{cite:ec66d18a-a660-4ba7-9aa0-134eccdeb714}} have found similar results, with the
exception of a mild correlation between cluster half-light radius and metallicity:
more metal-rich clusters tend to be smaller. The same effect is seen in more distant galaxies
where the clusters' structures are barely resolved.
{{cite:1bb76fbb-a2b1-4fc8-a9dd-026a8bb0b092}} discuss several possible explanations and conclude that the FORMULA 
correlation is most likely a consequence of the correlation between FORMULA  and FORMULA 
and the tendency of metal-rich GCs to be located at smaller FORMULA .
Figure REF  plots structural parameters and [Fe/H] for our sample as
a function of galactocentric distance FORMULA . For the Milky Way clusters
the true three-dimensional distance is used, while for external galaxies only
projected distances are available. For the M31 clusters, no correlation of
concentration FORMULA  with FORMULA  is seen. Central surface brightness FORMULA 
becomes fainter with increasing FORMULA  but this is likely to be a selection
effect: fainter clusters are difficult to see against the bright background of
the M31 bulge ({{cite:c29a35ef-b6bb-4f9f-8a4c-c961b1b96d9a}} discuss the same effect in detail for NGC 5128).
As expected, FORMULA  increases with FORMULA , although the
trend is largely driven by the innermost clusters in M31. In the Milky Way
the FORMULA  trend is driven both by small inner clusters and the large
clusters at very large distances from the Galactic center. Such distant, low-surface
brightness clusters will be difficult to detect in external galaxies, and their
absence from the present sample may well be due to selection effects.
For the clusters in NGC 5128, which cover a more restricted range in FORMULA ,
{{cite:c29a35ef-b6bb-4f9f-8a4c-c961b1b96d9a}} conclude that the FORMULA  trend is weak and only
marginally significant. For the M31 and Milky Way clusters, a weak correlation
of [Fe/H] with FORMULA  is present, but again is driven mainly by
clusters at the extremes of FORMULA .
The Magellanic Cloud and Fornax dSph clusters are offset from the larger
galaxies in all of these plots, as might be expected from the parent galaxies' smaller sizes.
Scaling cluster properties by galactocentric distance as in {{cite:61c4ed7e-9b09-4a39-905d-1f94c8e7fa45}}
is therefore expected to be useful in computing the `fundamental plane'
for these clusters.
There are half a dozen very small (FORMULA  pc) M31 clusters visible in the
upper right panel of Figure REF . Such clusters are not found in
the other galaxies studied, which makes their presence in M31 slightly suspicious.
Of the six clusters, only the largest, B155, has a confirmatory radial velocity
{{cite:fd15bce7-318d-447b-a422-4b3e2d97f112}} while the remainder are classified by those authors as “cluster candidates”.
The compactness of these objects makes assessing their nature problematic, even
with the use of HST imaging. They are a reminder that the structural analysis of
star clusters in distant galaxies will always be problematic: existing catalogs are
neither fully complete nor entirely reliable.
Figure REF  plots cluster
structural parameters as a function of [Fe/H]; only clusters with measured values of
[Fe/H] (not assumed average values) are shown.
No correlation of concentration FORMULA  with [Fe/H] is seen.
A weak correlation of FORMULA  with [Fe/H] is present in the expected sense:
FORMULA  decreases with increased metallicity.
The exception is NGC 5128, for which the best-fit slope of
FORMULA  against [Fe/H] is zero; the present sample of clusters in this galaxy also has
a lower metallicity gradient ([Fe/H] vs. FORMULA ) than in other galaxies.
The FORMULA [Fe/H] corrlation weakens if only clusters with FORMULA  kpc are considered,
suggesting that a different mix of bulge and halo clusters in M31
and the Milky Way compared to NGC 5128 may be responsible.
For central surface brightness FORMULA  there is a slight
systematic increase with [Fe/H], likely because of the weak correlation of [Fe/H]
and FORMULA . Finally, the lower-right panel shows that there is
a weak mass-metallicity correlation: this is due entirely to our use of population
synthesis model mass-to-light ratios, which increase rapidly above
FORMULA  {{cite:c29a35ef-b6bb-4f9f-8a4c-c961b1b96d9a}}.
All of these trends,
however, are mild compared with the correlations with cluster luminosity
to be presented below.
Figure REF  shows some of the correlations between cluster parameters
and luminosity, for GCs in M31, the Milky Way, NGC 5128, the Magellanic Clouds (MCs), and
the Fornax dSph. The properties of clusters in all six galaxies fall in the same
regions of parameter space. The selection effects discussed above are apparent
in that there are fewer faint and low-surface-brightness clusters in the extragalactic samples.
The new M31 ACS/STIS observations in particular
do not contain any faint, low-concentration clusters, partly because the ACS
observations targeted luminous M31 clusters and also because very low-concentration
M31 clusters are too well-resolved to be analyzed with the ellipse-fitting method used
(see § REF ). There are few very large (FORMULA  pc) extragalactic
clusters, probably because these are difficult to recognize and more easily confused
with background galaxies. The right-hand panels of the Figure show the lack of
correlation between FORMULA  and FORMULA  and the strong correlation of FORMULA  with FORMULA  which
are both hallmarks of the globular cluster fundamental plane. The fundamental plane
correlations evidently hold over nearly 4 decades in luminosity and in a variety
of environments.

The Fundamental Plane
Correlations between globular cluster structural parameters are
often summarized as describing a “fundamental plane” analogous to (but different from)
that for elliptical galaxies. There are several equivalent formulations of the globular cluster
fundamental plane in the literature {{cite:321661fe-45a1-4fbe-8b9a-33739f932707}}, {{cite:9a6fa58e-ac86-4278-bb68-5d1ea81d39f7}}, {{cite:61c4ed7e-9b09-4a39-905d-1f94c8e7fa45}}, {{cite:c29a35ef-b6bb-4f9f-8a4c-c961b1b96d9a}}.
Here we concentrate on the relationships between half-light radius, mass, and binding energy
to search for differences between the fundamental planes of clusters
in different galaxies. An important caveat to this analysis is that the GC masses used are
derived from population synthesis model-predicted mass-to-light
ratios, not from directly observed velocity dispersions (see § REF ).
One of the many ways of looking at the globular cluster fundamental plane
is a plot of projected cluster half-light radii as a function of mass.
Modulo some stretching, this plot is equivalent to one of projected half-light
surface density FORMULA  versus FORMULA , which in turn is the largest part of
the FORMULA  and FORMULA  parameter space. A different reformulation
makes FORMULA  vs. FORMULA  equivalent to binding energy FORMULA  vs. FORMULA :
FORMULA  where FORMULA  is a weak function of the cluster concentration
{{cite:61c4ed7e-9b09-4a39-905d-1f94c8e7fa45}}.
Figure REF  shows FORMULA  versus FORMULA  for GCs in all of our galaxies. As
is well known from previous investigations of the Galactic GC system
{{cite:8f506f06-64a7-40ac-be92-c438824f39e8}}, {{cite:2ed68725-9edd-47a6-9b5d-9c6be70813e0}}, there is no clear, monotonic mass-radius relation for globular
clusters. However, at masses FORMULA  there is an
apparent upturn in the lower envelope of FORMULA  versus FORMULA . {{cite:c29a35ef-b6bb-4f9f-8a4c-c961b1b96d9a}}
interpret this increasing lower bound on FORMULA  for
clusters as an extension of a very similar relation for early-type
galaxies. The latter relation follows from the existence of a “zone of
exclusion” in the (luminosity-based) FORMULA  space of {{cite:321661fe-45a1-4fbe-8b9a-33739f932707}},
which can be interpreted as a mass-dependent upper limit
on the average surface density FORMULA . The bound FORMULA  for galaxies, simply extrapolated
down into the GC mass range, is drawn as the dash-dot line in Figure REF ;
see {{cite:c29a35ef-b6bb-4f9f-8a4c-c961b1b96d9a}} for further details.
The two dashed lines in the lower-left corner of the Figure
represent a different bound on GC size: evaporation by two-body relaxation,
which is expected to occur within 20–40 initial half-mass relaxation times
{{cite:b38782e0-932d-4a06-8f7b-dd61c6393e57}}. The two lines correspond to FORMULA  Gyr (upper)
and FORMULA  Gyr (lower); clusters which formed with masses and sizes
to the lower-left of these lines are expected to have evaporated by the present day.
Several of the M31 clusters are below the `evaporation' lines, indicating that they
must have evolved into this region of the diagram and may in fact be dissolving.
The most extreme of these are the very compact M31 clusters discussed in
§ REF . The identfication of these objects as M31 GCs is
somewhat suspect: high-resolution spectroscopic observations would be of interest
to confirm their status and measure velocity dispersions.
None of the galaxies' clusters show evidence for correlation of half-light radius
with mass, but there are differences between galaxies in both position and scatter
of their clusters in Figure REF .
The larger scatter for Milky Way clusters compared to those in M31 and NGC 5128
can be attributed to the presence of more very diffuse clusters in the MW sample
{{cite:c29a35ef-b6bb-4f9f-8a4c-c961b1b96d9a}}
and greater distance uncertainties for individual Galactic GCs.
The M31 sample has very few diffuse clusters due to the selection effects described above,
and so is offset to smaller average FORMULA  than the Milky Way or NGC 5128 samples
The Magellanic Cloud and Fornax cluster samples are complete, however, and
have larger average FORMULA  than the large-galaxy GCs.
Is the difference between cluster sizes in different galaxies due to local environment?
The structure of tidally-limited clusters should depend on the local galaxy density,
and cluster sizes are known to be correlated with galactocentric position (see the
upper right panel of Figure REF ). A better indicator of galactic
potential than galactocentric distance alone is:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the galaxy circular velocity.The normalization of FORMULA  ensures that quantities derived from it are
equivalent to those plotted for Milky Way clusters in {{cite:61c4ed7e-9b09-4a39-905d-1f94c8e7fa45}}.
It should properly be computed with the three-dimensional galactocentric
distance, but only the projected distance is available for the extragalactic clusters.
We use values FORMULA  in km sFORMULA  of: Milky Way, 220;
M31, 230 {{cite:a0ae2083-ec2a-4339-b684-3fa9391592f7}}; NGC 5128, 190 {{cite:a1399aab-52f0-41ee-8b72-4de84dc42143}}, {{cite:8f03cba1-e5fb-4eb9-b020-3f521d9e30a7}}, {{cite:d487e896-0451-4c90-af82-330cde98eb10}}, {{cite:6e9c748a-8cca-4dd4-a7a7-01770bf3ad4d}};
LMC, 65 {{cite:169303a1-21c5-41f3-a7ff-8d70eba179c1}}; SMC, 60 {{cite:9e0c2879-ad58-46af-88fe-2406b3b5291a}}, and Fornax dSph, 18 {{cite:6109d789-7066-4154-b73f-4da5c3472436}}.
For a galaxy whose total mass distribution
is an isothermal sphere, mass density FORMULA , so
FORMULA  is a guide to the local galaxy density.
Figure REF  shows FORMULA  as a function of re-normalized galactocentric
distance FORMULA , with the four galaxies plotted separately.
The normalization has removed the FORMULA  offset between the Magellanic Cloud/Fornax clusters
and those in the large galaxies, indicating that the larger cluster sizes
in the small galaxies can be understood as due to the lower galactic densities.
The least-squares fit of FORMULA  is shown
for each galaxy, and given in Table . As might be expected,
there is less dependence of FORMULA  on FORMULA  for the extragalactic clusters
compared to the Milky Way GCs, due to the use of projected galactocentric distances in
computing FORMULA .
The normalization by galactic potential should allow us to fairly
compare the fundamental planes of clusters in the different galaxies.
In analogy with {{cite:61c4ed7e-9b09-4a39-905d-1f94c8e7fa45}} and {{cite:ec66d18a-a660-4ba7-9aa0-134eccdeb714}} we define the re-normalized quantities
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is derived from the fits given above.
Figure REF  shows that there is no correlation of FORMULA  with [Fe/H],
so any differences between galaxies are not due to residual effects of metallicity
on the fundamental plane.
The top panel of Figure REF  shows FORMULA  versus FORMULA , with the
the corresponding least-squares fits for each galaxy given in Table .
The basic proportionality FORMULA  is built into the definition of
FORMULA , and clusters in all galaxies follow this relation very tightly.
In particular, the fits for
NGC 5128 and Milky Way clusters are identical within their errors, confirming
the {{cite:ec66d18a-a660-4ba7-9aa0-134eccdeb714}} result with a sample three times
larger and extending to much lower luminosities.
At the high end of the mass range, the clusters in both M31 and NGC 5128 fall below
the best-fit lines, indicative of the `break' in
cluster properties at FORMULA  MFORMULA  noted by {{cite:c29a35ef-b6bb-4f9f-8a4c-c961b1b96d9a}}.
Below this break, the fits for all galaxies are similar, with the largest
differences at the low-mass end where the number of clusters is small
and measurement errors are large.
The bottom panel of Figure REF  shows the difference between
FORMULA  predicted from the Milky Way fit and the measured values.
Table  gives the mean offsets for each galaxy.
The NGC 5128 and Magellanic Cloud clusters (and the Milky Way clusters, by
construction) have offsets consistent with zero, while the M31 clusters have
a slight offset which can be attributed to sampling issues: the lack
of diffuse clusters and the presence of the low-FORMULA  objects at FORMULA  M FORMULA
Globular clusters have a strikingly similar nature
in the widely different environments we have sampled, including a dwarf
spheroidal, irregulars, large disk galaxies, and a giant elliptical.
The homogeneous and internally precise data we can now work with,
in addition to the much larger sample sizes of clusters, have
established the trend of the fundamental plane securely, showing
that globular clusters in all these environments follow the first-order
trend FORMULA  quite accurately. The scatter around this
basic relation is surprisingly small, showing that the structural
properties of these star clusters are far simpler than we could
have expected from theoretical arguments alone. Even the
most massive GCs seem to show a fairly smooth transition between
the properties of clusters and those of dwarf galaxies.

Summary
New Hubble Space Telescope observations are used to construct surface brightness profiles for
34 M31 globular clusters, including the most massive clusters in the galaxy. Structural
models are fit to the surface brightness profiles: for reasons not yet understood,
M31 clusters are unlike those in other nearby galaxies in slightly preferring {{cite:180bd449-b0aa-4918-aa6a-a9400081904b}} models
over the more extended {{cite:c04595a7-3d20-40d2-8ffc-66f8258a6030}} models. When combined with previously-published data,
we now have a comprehensive and publicly available compilation of a complete
suite of structural and dynamical parameters for as many GCs in M31 as in the Milky Way.
The structural parameters of
clusters in M31 and other local galaxies define a very tight fundamental plane with similar slopes
FORMULA ,
showing the essential similarity of clusters in different environments over a range
of almost 4 decades in luminosity or mass.
M31 clusters are slightly offset from the FORMULA  relation
defined by the Milky Way and NGC 5128, likely because of sampling effects.
In both M31 and NGC 5128 clusters, the most massive GCs trend towards
dwarf galaxies in the binding-energy/mass relation at about FORMULA  MFORMULA .
The detailed modeling made possible by high-resolution imaging shows that
the overall properties of globular clusters in different galaxies are
remarkably similar; the subtle differences noted here may point to differences
in the histories or environments of their parent galaxies.
The present dataset pushes our assessment of the fundamental plane
beyond the previous state of the field {{cite:61c4ed7e-9b09-4a39-905d-1f94c8e7fa45}}, {{cite:ec66d18a-a660-4ba7-9aa0-134eccdeb714}}, {{cite:89200cb4-8d55-437a-802a-67e397dbf7fe}}, {{cite:adb9445d-e9e9-48be-822b-94d4f636012e}},
making it possible to search for second-order trends in the FP line
and probe the transition between the structures of globular clusters and galaxies.
