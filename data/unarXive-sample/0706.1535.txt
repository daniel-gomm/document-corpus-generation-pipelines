The earliest phases of clustered star formation and the origin of the stellar initial mass function (IMF)
are currently much debated. In one school of thought the IMF of embedded clusters
is entirely determined by turbulent fragmentation at the prestellar stage of star formation, while in a major
alternative view it results from dynamical interactions and competitive accretion at the protostellar stage.
In an effort to discriminate between these two pictures for the origin of the IMF, we investigated
the internal and relative motions of starless condensations and protostars
previously detected by us in the dust continuum at 1.2 mm
in the L1688 protocluster of the Ophiuchus molecular cloud complex.
The starless condensations have a mass spectrum
resembling the IMF and are therefore likely representative of the initial stages of star formation in the protocluster.
We carried out detailed molecular line observations, including some NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0) mapping, of the
Ophiuchus protocluster condensations using the IRAM 30m telescope.

We measured subsonic or at most transonic levels of internal turbulence within the condensations, implying virial masses
which generally agree within a factor of FORMULA  with the masses derived from the 1.2 mm dust continuum.
This supports the notion that most
of the L1688 starless condensations are gravitationally bound and prestellar in nature.
We detected the classical spectroscopic signature of infall motions in CS(2–1), CS(3–2), HFORMULA CO(FORMULA ),
and/or HCOFORMULA (3–2) toward six condensations, and obtained tentative infall signatures toward 10 other condensations.
In addition, we measured a global one-dimensional velocity dispersion of less than FORMULA  km sFORMULA  (or twice
the sound speed) between condensations. The small relative velocity dispersion implies that, in general, the
condensations do not have time to interact with one another before evolving into pre-main sequence
objects.
Our observations support the view that the IMF is partly determined by cloud fragmentation at the
prestellar stage. Competitive accretion is unlikely to be the dominant mechanism at the protostellar stage
in the Ophiuchus protocluster, but it may possibly
govern the growth of starless, self-gravitating
condensations initially produced by gravoturbulent fragmentation toward an IMF, Salpeter-like mass spectrum.

Introduction
While most stars are believed to form in clusters {{cite:10f0ce26-011c-442f-b4dc-4f44c33d454e}}, {{cite:2204e432-a41f-462b-821b-4be6845f7ad3}},
our present theoretical understanding of the star
formation process is essentially limited to isolated dense cores and
protostars {{cite:67decdd8-0be0-49fc-b82f-d51a5e747f38}}, {{cite:805d7f80-c9c6-4417-824e-438de11c0bc4}}.
Studying the formation and detailed properties of prestellar condensations
in cluster-forming clouds is thus of prime importance if we are to
explain the origin of the stellar initial mass function (IMF).
Some progress has recently been made in this area
{{cite:7ecd1fee-fa19-44a1-8f58-f2afb6b49ea3}}, {{cite:2f9f3b03-c1da-4898-9bcc-c4c324ae73d1}}, {{cite:850f01d3-ce48-4e9c-9f3d-f269e44367d0}}.
On the observational side, recent ground-based (sub)-millimeter continuum
surveys of a few nearby cluster-forming clouds such as
the L1688 clump in Ophiuchus (also known as the FORMULA  Ophiuchi main cloud; FORMULA  150 pc),
the Serpens central clump (FORMULA  pc), or the NGC 2068/2071 clumps
in Orion B (FORMULA  pc) have uncovered `complete'
samples of prestellar condensations whose associated mass distributions
resemble the stellar IMF
{{cite:11ae1524-54d3-40d9-8d7c-b14f5eeeae24}}, {{cite:3764c0bf-d1ce-4135-b0f8-ca975bbc1590}}, {{cite:0e9513f5-4eb4-4df1-9d54-8c1b054c2ce8}}, {{cite:eb02664d-bcd7-4ac1-a404-edd679c12d10}}.
In particular, this is the case for the population of 57 starless
condensations identified by {{cite:66ab4ffe-19d2-449a-a753-482cc5c04ebb}} in their 1.2 mm continuum mosaic of L1688 with
the MPIfR bolometer array (MAMBO) on the IRAM 30m telescope.
These Ophiuchus condensations, which were identified using a multi-resolution
analysis equivalent to a wavelet decomposition {{cite:4aaf2438-08f4-46de-b4ff-170189929982}}, {{cite:3fd8c07d-ff6f-4ce6-9e51-7bb936f2b298}}, are seen
on the same spatial scales as protostellar envelopes (i.e., FORMULA  2300–4500 AU or
FORMULA  in L1688).
Their mass spectrum is consistent with the {{cite:a807f4cc-e14c-424b-9c2a-86ac59a81f8f}} power-law IMF
at the high-mass end and shows a tentative break at FORMULA 
(see Fig. REF ).
This break is reminiscent of the flattening observed in the IMF of field
stars below FORMULA  {{cite:0091c315-ada4-4f11-9c2b-48a6416309f1}}, {{cite:e9403d41-b4fa-4426-bdfb-70b992590ff6}},
also present in the mass function of L1688 pre-main sequence objects
{{cite:2c813015-be63-44d5-95e5-ee3961d2fb23}}, {{cite:eb02664d-bcd7-4ac1-a404-edd679c12d10}}.
If real, the break occurs at a mass comparable to the typical Jeans mass
in the dense (FORMULA ) DCOFORMULA  cores of the central Ophiuchus
molecular cloud {{cite:cdcf46f4-7a0a-4c70-943f-5f59df87126f}}.
The results of {{cite:66ab4ffe-19d2-449a-a753-482cc5c04ebb}} in L1688 were essentially confirmed by
independent (sub)-millimeter dust continuum surveys of the same region
with SCUBA on JCMT {{cite:3764c0bf-d1ce-4135-b0f8-ca975bbc1590}} and SIMBA on SEST
{{cite:85df8d63-1097-469b-bfe3-9eaad4303080}}.
FIGURE 
Such a close resemblance of their mass spectrum to the IMF,
in both shape and mass scale, suggests that the starless
condensations identified by {{cite:66ab4ffe-19d2-449a-a753-482cc5c04ebb}}
are about to form stars on a one-to-one or perhaps one-to-two basis,
with a high local efficiency, i.e., FORMULA  > FORMULA 50%FORMULA M < 0.3  MFORMULA On the theoretical side, two main scenarios have been proposed
for clustered star formation in turbulent molecular clouds.
In the first scenario, the distribution of stellar masses
is primarily determined by gravoturbulent cloud fragmentation at the
prestellar stage.
Briefly, self-gravitating condensations
form as turbulence-generated density fluctuations
{{cite:aaa8bdc1-9b8a-4143-bd64-eefdfcd114e3}}, {{cite:ee713c0c-64b7-4633-9cdb-65228c1d828f}}, then decouple from
their turbulent environment through the dissipation of MHD waves on small
scales {{cite:86b002f8-1d6f-456d-935f-b9552ac6ee64}}, {{cite:73e5242c-76ca-44f4-af96-83cbe102b0c2}},
and eventually collapse with little interaction with their
surroundings. Such protocluster condensations
are local minima of turbulence (traced by narrow linewidths) and have
small relative motions with respect to one another and to the surrounding
gas. A given star is entirely formed from (a fraction of) the gas that
was initially present in the corresponding prestellar condensation.
Thus, in this scenario, the IMF derives directly from the condensation mass
distribution (CMD) {{cite:ee713c0c-64b7-4633-9cdb-65228c1d828f}},
which provides a simple explanation for the observed similarity between the CMD and the IMF
(e.g. {{cite:66ab4ffe-19d2-449a-a753-482cc5c04ebb}} and Fig. REF ).
By contrast, in the second scenario, the distribution of stellar masses
results entirely from the dynamics of the parent protocluster
{{cite:976fd19a-e425-426f-ba9e-097b4cdd5372}}, {{cite:bf83cad5-432f-4c4e-929b-77f71a1280b8}}.
Here, a protocluster is initially made up of gas and protostellar seeds.
These protostellar seeds result from turbulence-generated cloud structure
like in the first scenario, but their initial masses are unrelated to final stellar masses.
The seeds travel in the gravitational potential well of the system
and are characterized by a large, essentially virial velocity dispersion.
They accrete mass competitively as they execute several orbits through
the protocluster.
The seed trajectories within the protocluster are highly stochastic in nature
and feature close encounters, merging and/or dynamical ejections.
In this alternative scenario, competitive accretion and
dynamical interactions between individual protocluster members play a
dominant role in shaping the resulting IMF at the protostellar (Class 0/Class I)
stage {{cite:a0532561-39c5-4c4b-901f-6c62dd26e6ca}}.
Furthermore, most of the final mass of a given star comes from gas
that was initially not gravitationally bound to the corresponding protostellar
seed(s) {{cite:69bbaf9b-1bee-44ed-a15e-bba5963ab20d}}.
In an effort to discriminate between these two broad pictures for the origin of
the IMF and further constrain the nature of the starless condensations identified
by {{cite:66ab4ffe-19d2-449a-a753-482cc5c04ebb}}, we carried out detailed molecular line observations of the
central Ophiuchus protocluster with the IRAM 30m telescope.
The present paper describes the results of these line observations and
discusses them in the context of the above-mentioned theoretical scenarios
for clustered star formation.
The layout of the paper is as follows. Section  provides
observational details. Section  presents the results of our
line mapping observations. Section  analyzes the constraints
set by these observations on the kinematics of the
L1688 protocluster.
We discuss the implications of our results for our understanding of cluster-forming
clouds in Sect. . Our conclusions are summarized in Sect. .

Observations
We used the IRAM 30m telescope at Pico Veleta, Spain, in June 1998, July 2000, and June 2005
to carry out millimeter line observations of the DCOFORMULA  cores and
1.2 mm continuum condensations of L1688
in the following molecular transitions:
NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0), HFORMULA COFORMULA (1-0),
CS(2-1), CFORMULA S(2-1) at 3 mm,
CS(3-2), HFORMULA CO(2FORMULA -1FORMULA ), DCOFORMULA (2-1) at 2 mm, and HCOFORMULA (3-2)
at 1.1 mm.
Our adopted set of rest line frequencies is given in Table REF .
The half-power beamwidth of the telescope was FORMULA , FORMULA ,
and FORMULA  at 3 mm, 2 mm, and 1.1 mm, respectively.
We used four SIS heterodyne receivers simultaneously and an autocorrelation
spectrometer as backend, with a spectral resolution of 20–40 kHz at 3 mm and 2 mm,
and 40 kHz at 1.1 mm. The corresponding velocity resolution ranged from
0.04 to 0.07 km sFORMULA  per channel, depending on the observed transition.
All our observations were performed in single sideband mode, with sideband rejections
of 0.01, 0.1 and 0.05 at 3 mm, 2 mm and 1.1 mm, respectively.
The resulting calibration uncertainty is FORMULA .
The forward and beam efficiencies of the telescope
used to convert antenna temperatures FORMULA  into
main beam temperatures FORMULA  are listed in Table REF .
The telescope pointing was checked every FORMULA  hours
on NRAO 530 and/or 1514-241 and found to be accurate to
FORMULA  (rms).
The telescope focus was optimized on 3C273 and NRAO 530 every FORMULA  hours on average.
Single-point line observations were performed in the position switching mode,
while extensive mapping was performed in the “on-the-fly” (OTF) mode.
All of the data were reduced with the CLASS software packagesee

Molecular line mapping results and analysis
Detections of protocluster condensations in NFORMULA HFORMULA (1–0) and other tracers
The NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0) integrated intensity mapsOur NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0) data cubes are available in FITS format at the CDS.
we took toward the six main DCOFORMULA  cores of the Ophiuchus
central cloud are shown in Fig. REF . The positions of the starless 1.2 mm continuum
condensations found by {{cite:66ab4ffe-19d2-449a-a753-482cc5c04ebb}} are marked by crosses.
NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0) emission was found to be present toward most of these condensations.
Altogether, we performed NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0) observations toward 48
of the 57 compact starless condensations{{cite:66ab4ffe-19d2-449a-a753-482cc5c04ebb}} counted 58 compact starless condensations but one
of these – E-MM3 – was subsequently shown to be an edge-on T Tauri disk as opposed to a prestellar object {{cite:dd36d9a1-451f-40bf-bf20-370d360b3b5f}}.
identified by {{cite:66ab4ffe-19d2-449a-a753-482cc5c04ebb}}
and detected line emission for 41 of them, either through position-switch integrations (rms FORMULA  K in FORMULA  units)
or in OTF maps (rms FORMULA  0.1–0.2 K, depending on core).
However, the FORMULA  angular resolution of our NFORMULA HFORMULA 
observations is not always sufficient to clearly distinguish between line emission from the condensations
themselves and emission from the parent cloud/DCOFORMULA  core. In order to estimate the background NFORMULA HFORMULA 
emission from the parent core, we used our OTF maps to produce a smoothed NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0) image of the
local background toward each object. In practice, we used the multi-resolution wavelet analysis software of
{{cite:4aaf2438-08f4-46de-b4ff-170189929982}} to decompose our OTF NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0) data cubes into two
wavelet “views”, corresponding to small (FORMULA  20-40) and large (FORMULA  >  FORMULA FORMULA FORMULA FORMULAFORMULA 1FORMULA 2FORMULA +FORMULA +FORMULA Additional HFORMULA COFORMULA (1-0) and DCOFORMULA (2-1) OTF maps were obtained toward some of the cores
(cf. Fig. REF ), which were background-subtracted and analyzed in a similar fashion.
TABLE 
At the position of each target condensation/protostar,
the seven hyperfine components of the NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0) multiplet were fitted simultaneously using the
Gaussian HFS (HyperFine Structure) fitting routine of the CLASS software package.
This routine derives the line optical depth by assuming the same excitation temperature
for all hyperfine components, and therefore yields an estimate of the intrinsic linewidth (i.e., properly corrected
for optical depth effects provided that the assumption is correct).
The results of these HFS fits, both before and after background subtraction,
are given in Table REF 
for all the objects detected in NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0).
(Note that, in some cases, the signal-to-noise ratio was not good enough to perform a significant HFS fit after background
subtraction.)
The quoted error bars correspond to standard deviations (FORMULA ) as estimated by the HFS routine
of CLASS.
Examples of NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0) spectra and HFS fits are shown in Fig. REF .
A single-component HFS fit failed and a two-component HFS fit was required
for three condensations in Oph B1, four condensations in Oph B2, one condensation in Oph F, as well as
the protostar CRBR 85.
TABLE 
In addition, we also used the Gaussclumps fitting procedure of {{cite:6b1b878f-cc52-4a1a-ace2-d511d1e70730}}
{{cite:84e0786a-3bea-4e4e-a027-06f3f9da57ad}} to decompose each of our background-subtracted OTF NFORMULA HFORMULA (101-012), HFORMULA COFORMULA (1-0),
and DCOFORMULA (2-1) data cubes into a series of Gaussian-shaped “clumps”. The significant (FORMULA ) clumps identified with
Gaussclumps in the various DCOFORMULA  cores of L1688 are shown as ellipses in
Fig. REF  and Fig. REF .
Their main characteristics are given in Table REF .
In this way, a total of 17 starless 1.2 mm condensations and 3 Class 0/Class I protostars (VLA 1623, LFAM 26, GY 210)
were found to have well-defined NFORMULA HFORMULA , HFORMULA COFORMULA , or DCOFORMULA  counterparts in position-velocity (FORMULA ) space.
The relevance of such a Gaussclumps decomposition is that it further helped us discriminate between the line emission
arising from the compact condensations themselves (with well-defined “positions” in FORMULA  space) and the line emission from
the surrounding, more extended dense gas (with less-well-defined “positions” in FORMULA  space).
In particular, for six of the above-mentioned eight condensations with double NFORMULA HFORMULA  HFS components, the Gaussclumps decomposition
allowed us to reject one of the two components and to identify the component most likely associated with the compact 1.2 mm continuum
object.
In Oph B1, for instance, two HFS components were detected toward B1-MM2, B1-MM3, and B1-MM4 prior to background
subtraction (cf. Table REF ), but only one of these two components was found to be associated with each condensation
after running Gaussclumps on the background-subtracted NFORMULA HFORMULA (101-012) data cubes (cf. Table REF ).
In the following, we will consider the multiple components detected toward the remaining two
condensations with double HFS components (B2-MM2 and B2-MM4)
as representative of independent objects when we discuss the statistics of linewidths (Sect.  REF )
and relative motions (Sect.  REF ) between condensations.

Linewidths and virial masses of the protocluster condensations
TABLE 
Based on the measured NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0) linewidths (Table REF ),
we can calculate the nonthermal component of the
line-of-sight velocity dispersion {{cite:5713fee3-9d18-4965-956d-9a4ffceab55f}}
and estimate a virial mass for each condensation.
Table REF  gives the deconvolved (FWHM) diameter
(col. [2], {{cite:66ab4ffe-19d2-449a-a753-482cc5c04ebb}})
and gas FORMULA  dust mass derived from the 1.2 mm continuum (col. [4],
{{cite:66ab4ffe-19d2-449a-a753-482cc5c04ebb}}), the assumed gas/dust temperature (col. [3], cf.
{{cite:66ab4ffe-19d2-449a-a753-482cc5c04ebb}}), the thermal velocity dispersion FORMULA 
for a particle of mean molecular weight FORMULA  (col. [5]),
the one-dimensional nonthermal velocity dispersion FORMULA 
obtained from the NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0) linewidth (col. [6]), the nonthermal to
thermal velocity dispersion ratio FORMULA  (col. [7]),
the estimated virial mass FORMULA  (col. [8]), and the virial mass ratio
FORMULA  (col. [9]) for each observed object.
Columns [10] to [13] list the values of the same parameters when estimated from the
background-subtracted spectra.
For some condensations, the dust temperatures (col. [3]) adopted to estimate FORMULA 
(col. [4]) from the measured 1.2mm flux differ slightly from those assumed by
{{cite:66ab4ffe-19d2-449a-a753-482cc5c04ebb}}. Here, we used FORMULA  K for all condensations except SM1N, SM1,
A-MM6, SM2, A-MM8 in Oph A, which are likely warmer (FORMULA  K)
due to their proximity to the B3 star S1 {{cite:f5e6bbbf-d112-4d95-b9e2-222862e59317}}. Our adopted default
FORMULA  K is consistent with the typical mass-averaged temperature found by
dust radiative transfer models of starless cores {{cite:98a2a5be-7dd7-440d-8959-c6f5f3b09a61}}, {{cite:c5b4589b-093e-4dc1-953b-aa7b2c70c845}}.
In agreement with the radial profiles measured by {{cite:66ab4ffe-19d2-449a-a753-482cc5c04ebb}}, the values quoted for FORMULA  and FORMULA 
assume that the density structure of the sources approaches that of centrally-condensed
spheres with outer profiles such as FORMULA , for which FORMULA .
Here, FORMULA  is the total
(thermal FORMULA  nonthermal) line-of-sight velocity dispersion and FORMULA  is the condensation outer radius,
which we take to be twice the geometrical mean of the deconvolved major and minor HWHM radii
measured in the 1.2 mm dust continuum
(i.e., FORMULA  – cf. col. [2] of Table REF  and Table 2 of {{cite:66ab4ffe-19d2-449a-a753-482cc5c04ebb}}).
For unresolved condensations, the quoted FORMULA  and FORMULA  values are only upper limits
obtained under the assumption that the deconvolved FWHM diameter is 400 AU (i.e., FORMULA  one fourth of
the HPBW spatial resolution of the 1.2 mm continuum observations).
Note also that our NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0) observations provide the line-of-sight velocity dispersion
averaged over a FORMULA  beam, while the FWHM angular size of the dust condensations
ranges from FORMULA  to FORMULA .
However, since both FORMULA  and FORMULA  are derived for a diameter FORMULA  twice the FWHM size,
our method of estimating FORMULA  should be reasonably accurate.
Some of the secondary components listed in
Table REF  were ignored in Table REF ,
based on the Gaussclumps identifications summarized in
Table REF .
The measured NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0) linewidths are narrow, indicative of
small internal velocity dispersions.
Prior to background subtraction,
the average one-dimensional nonthermal
velocity dispersion, FORMULA , is estimated to be
FORMULA  0.20 FORMULA  0.08 km sFORMULA 
among the 43 components listed in Table REF .
More precisely, the average one-dimensional nonthermal
velocity dispersion of the condensations ranges from 0.12 FORMULA  0.02 km sFORMULA  in Oph E,
0.13 FORMULA  0.02 km sFORMULA  in Oph C,
0.15 FORMULA  0.04 km sFORMULA  in Oph B1/B1B2,
0.17 FORMULA  0.04 km sFORMULA  in Oph F,
to 0.20 FORMULA  0.08 km sFORMULA  in Oph A, and
0.24 FORMULA  0.08 km sFORMULA  in Oph B2.
For comparison, the isothermal sound speed or one-dimensional thermal velocity
dispersion is FORMULA  0.21–0.27 km sFORMULA  for gas temperatures
of 12–20 K. Therefore, the condensations of Oph A, Oph B1, Oph C, Oph E, and
Oph F are characterized by only subsonic
levels of internal turbulence with
FORMULA  0.6–0.8 on average, while
the condensations of Oph B2 have at most “transonic” internal turbulence
with FORMULA  on average.
This is especially true since the measured nonthermal component of the NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0)
linewidth may overestimate the intrinsic level of internal turbulence in the presence of
infall motions and/or rotation (see Sect. REF  and
REF ).
In contrast, the line-of-sight velocity dispersions measured
on the scale of the parent DCOFORMULA  cores are significantly larger
{{cite:cdcf46f4-7a0a-4c70-943f-5f59df87126f}}, with corresponding values of FORMULA  ranging
from FORMULA  km sFORMULA  in Oph E, 0.2–0.3 km sFORMULA  in Oph C and
Oph F, to 0.35–0.5 km sFORMULA  in Oph A, Oph B1, and Oph B2.
Furthermore, the values of FORMULA 
derived from NHFORMULA  observations of the cores tend to be larger, by up to a factor of 2,
than those inferred from DCOFORMULA  {{cite:cdcf46f4-7a0a-4c70-943f-5f59df87126f}}. For instance,
FORMULA  km sFORMULA  is estimated in Oph B1 from NHFORMULA 
{{cite:c8da6cd6-9250-4d42-b5db-998854425a7d}}, compared to FORMULA  km sFORMULA  from DCOFORMULA .
Thus, the internal
velocity dispersions derived here for the compact condensations
are typically a factor of FORMULA  smaller than the nonthermal velocity dispersions
of their parent dense cores.
We conclude that the level of turbulence decreases from marginally supersonic on the
scale of the DCOFORMULA  cores to transonic or marginally subsonic on the scale
of the prestellar condensations.
The above results are reminiscent of the transition to “coherence” observed by {{cite:4913357e-e669-4cda-83e3-db2abe4421f3}} in
isolated starless cores. They suggest that, at least in nearby cluster-forming clouds,
the initial conditions for individual protostellar collapse are “coherent” and largely free of turbulence.
They are also consistent with scenarios, such as the “kernel” model of {{cite:73e5242c-76ca-44f4-af96-83cbe102b0c2}},
according to which protocluster condensations form by dissipation of MHD turbulence on small
scales within massive, turbulent cores {{cite:86b002f8-1d6f-456d-935f-b9552ac6ee64}}.

observed in CFORMULA O(2-1) but are not seen in NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0).
They likely arise from the ambient cloud rather than from
C-MM5 et C-MM6 themselves..
Such asymmetric line profiles skewed to the blue in optically thick tracers
are produced when a gradient in excitation temperature toward source center
is combined with inward motions {{cite:516e9fbd-8f43-4383-bb12-c8f891cbb3d0}}.
Here, among a total of 25 starless condensations observed in at least one optically thick
infall tracer and one optically thin transition, blue infall profiles are clearly
observed in 6 condensations (A-SM2, B2-MM16, C-MM5, C-MM6, E-MM2d, and E-MM4,
see Fig. REF ),
tentatively observed in 10 other condensations
(A-MM4, A-MM5, A-SM1, A-MM8, C-N, B2-MM12, B2-MM13, B2-MM14, B2-MM15, B2-MM17),
and not seen in the remaining 9 sources
(A-MM6, A-SM1N, F-MM1, F-MM2, B1-MM4, B2-MM2, B2-MM6, B2-MM8, B2-MM10).
In the case of A-SM2 and C-MM6,
the absorption dip observed in the optically thick line profiles is slightly
redshifted with respect to the LSR velocity traced by the optically
thin lines,
by FORMULA  and FORMULA  0.1-0.2 km sFORMULA , respectively.
This suggests that the outer gas layers responsible for the absorption dip in these
two condensations are characterized by significant inward velocities FORMULA  km sFORMULA 
{{cite:fb58051e-294c-44c1-b5d8-3b5c4ac3147d}}.
By contrast, the absorption dip is not redshifted (nor blueshifted) toward
E-MM2d, E-MM4, B2-MM16, and C-MM5, suggesting that only comparatively
deeper layers undergo infall motions in the latter sources.

Large-scale velocity structure
FIGURE 
In order to investigate the presence of systematic velocity gradients, such as rotational gradients,
within the DCOFORMULA  cores of L1688, we plot maps of the NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0) centroid velocity across
Oph A, Oph B1, Oph B2, Oph C-S, Oph E, and Oph F in
Fig. REF a–f.
These centroid velocity maps were derived from the original NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0) data cubes
before background subtraction.
No clear, large-scale velocity gradient can be seen in the velocity maps of
Oph A, Oph B1, and Oph B2, and the underlying kinematic structure cannot be described as
a simple superposition of a small number of velocity gradients.
In Oph A, which resembles a curved filament in the integrated intensity map, the two ends
of the filament are characterized by lower systemic velocities (FORMULA  and FORMULA  km sFORMULA )
than the central region (FORMULA  km sFORMULA ), dominated by the objects A-SM1 and VLA 1623.
In Oph B2, the two condensations B2-MM10 and B2-MM15 stand out with significantly higher
systemic velocities (FORMULA  km sFORMULA ) than the bulk of the
core (FORMULA  km sFORMULA ).
In Oph B1, two velocity components are detected on the lines of sight
to B1-MM2, B1-MM3, and B1-MM4. Based on the results of our
Gaussclumps analysis (see Table REF ), we believe that
only the FORMULA  km sFORMULA  component, connected to Oph B2,
is physically associated with the compact condensations B1-MM2, B1-MM3, and B1-MM4.
TABLE 
Well-defined NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0) velocity gradients were identified toward Oph C-S, Oph E, and Oph F,
and their amplitudes estimated using the least-squares fitting method of {{cite:8dd1bc06-c084-4f96-aa66-2773a9af5599}}.
In particular, Oph C-S is characterized by a systematic projected velocity gradient of mean
value FORMULA  km sFORMULA  pcFORMULA ,
with velocities increasing along the direction of position angle FORMULA  in
the plane of the sky (see Table REF  and Fig. REF f).
In Oph E, our NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0) data suggest the presence of a velocity gradient
FORMULA  km sFORMULA  pcFORMULA  at FORMULA 
(cf. Fig. REF e). The signal-to-noise ratio in our NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0) map is however
insufficient to constrain the nature of the velocity field.
Fortunately, we can also use our higher signal-to-noise maps taken in HFORMULA COFORMULA (1-0),
DCOFORMULA (2-1), and DCOFORMULA (3-2) to further constrain the velocity structure.
For Oph E as a whole,
the three tracers indicate a mean velocity gradient FORMULA  km sFORMULA  pcFORMULA  at
FORMULA , in fairly good agreement with the gradient suggested by the
NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0) data (cf. Fig. REF e).
In Oph F, our NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0) data indicate the presence of two distinct velocity components,
overlapping near the position of F-MM2 in the plane of the sky (see Fig. REF d).
Oph F may thus actually
consist of two independent dense cores, Oph F1 and Oph F2,
with differing line-of-sight velocities (FORMULA  and FORMULA  km sFORMULA ).
Figure REF d shows the direction of the mean
velocity gradient derived in each of these two cores (see Table REF  for derived
parameters).
The fact that the velocity gradient found in Oph F1
(FORMULA  km sFORMULA  pcFORMULA  at FORMULA )
is nearly opposite to the gradient in Oph F2
(FORMULA  km sFORMULA  pcFORMULA  at FORMULA )
The direction of the velocity gradient is however more uncertain in Oph F2
since it was derived using only 5 independent points.
supports the view that Oph F is made up of two independent cores,
partly overlapping in projection, and not a single core
with a mean velocity gradient FORMULA  km sFORMULA  pcFORMULA 
at FORMULA  as suggested by {{cite:cdcf46f4-7a0a-4c70-943f-5f59df87126f}}
based on lower-resolution DCOFORMULA (2-1) observations.
For L1688 considered as a whole (cf. Fig. REF ),
a global velocity gradient of FORMULA  km sFORMULA  pcFORMULA  is seen from North-West
(Oph A) to South-East (Oph F) (see also Loren 1989 in FORMULA CO and Loren et al. 1990 in DCOFORMULA ).
The direction of this large-scale gradient is FORMULA 
(cf. note a of Table REF ),
as determined by a least-squares fit to the observed distribution of the line-of-sight
systemic velocities of the condensations detected in NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0).
The observed velocity pattern is however clearly more complex than that expected from simple large-scale
rotation {{cite:a8ff2d60-811d-4110-8686-77271b721b22}}. For instance, the direction of the mean velocity gradient
changes to FORMULA  if the condensations of Oph B1 and Oph B2
are ignored.

Relative motions of the protocluster condensations within the DCOFORMULA  cores
Our estimates of the centroid line-of-sight velocities toward the
prestellar condensations of L1688 (cf. col. 7 of Table REF )
provide interesting constraints on the relative motions between condensations.
Figure REF  shows the distribution of systemic velocities as derived from
our NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0) HFS fits, overlaid on the lowest contours of the 1.2 mm continuum map of
{{cite:66ab4ffe-19d2-449a-a753-482cc5c04ebb}}.
FIGURE 
TABLE 
Both the velocity differences between neighboring condensations and the overall
velocity dispersion of the condensations within the
L1688 protocluster are small.
Table REF  gives the
one-dimensional velocity dispersion,
FORMULA , derived from our NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0) observations for various samples of condensations (cf. col. [6] and col. [7]).
This velocity dispersion was estimated in two ways, first around the mean LSR velocity of the condensations
(estimate given in col. [6]), and second around the mean centroid NFORMULA HFORMULA (101-012) velocity measured in the maps of
Fig. REF  (estimate given in col. [7]).
For the ensemble of 41 compact
prestellar condensations and 3 protostars detected in NFORMULA HFORMULA ,
we estimate a global velocity dispersion FORMULA  0.36 km sFORMULA  about
the mean systemic velocity  FORMULA FORMULAFORMULA  3.95 km sFORMULA .
Assuming isotropic random motions, this corresponds to a three-dimensional velocity dispersion
FORMULA  0.62 km sFORMULA 
(cf. col. [8] and [9] of Table REF ).
If the velocity distribution is Maxwellian, the mean condensation
speed relative to the center of mass of the system
is FORMULA  0.57 km sFORMULA 
and the mean relative speed between condensations is
FORMULA 
0.81 km sFORMULA .
Adopting a diameter FORMULA  pc {{cite:ff65f405-29d8-4382-aa42-1f1e21f4a470}} for the L1688 cloud,
such a velocity dispersion implies a typical crossing time,
FORMULA  1.8 FORMULA  yr
(cf. col. [10] and col. [11] of Table REF ),
for the condensations within the L1688 protocluster.
After subtracting the global, systematic velocity gradient of FORMULA  km sFORMULA  pcFORMULA 
seen across L1688 (cf. Sect. REF  above),
the resulting 1D velocity dispersion of the condensations is even lower,
FORMULA  km sFORMULA , suggesting that the crossing
time associated with purely random condensation motions is larger,
FORMULA  yr.
The crossing times estimated separately within the individual DCOFORMULA  cores
with a statistically significant number of condensations (i.e., Oph A, B2, C)
are only a factor of FORMULA  shorter, FORMULA  0.6-1.0 FORMULA  yr.

Discussion
Dynamical state and fate of the L1688 condensations
The starless condensations identified by {{cite:66ab4ffe-19d2-449a-a753-482cc5c04ebb}}
in L1688 are highly
centrally concentrated
and feature large density contrasts over the local background medium, strongly suggesting
they are self-gravitating. More specifically, the estimated mean densities of the condensations
exceed the mean densities of the parent DCOFORMULA  cores by a typical factor FORMULA  5–20,
while the mean column densities of the condensations exceed the background core
column densities by a factor FORMULA  >  FORMULAFORMULA BE/ext 2.4FORMULA BE/ext 1.5FORMULA The line observations reported in this paper provide more direct evidence that most of the
L1688 condensations are gravitationally bound.
Indeed, the narrow linewidths measured in NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0)
(see Sect. REF ) imply virial masses
which generally agree within a factor of FORMULA  with the mass estimates derived
by {{cite:66ab4ffe-19d2-449a-a753-482cc5c04ebb}} from the 1.2 mm dust continuum.
This can be considered a good agreement since both FORMULA 
and FORMULA  are themselves uncertain by a factor of FORMULA . On the theoretical side,
self-gravitating condensations are expected to have virial mass ratios
FORMULA  < FORMULA 2FORMULA vir 1FORMULA 2FORMULA +FORMULA vir < 1FORMULA vir FORMULA 2.5FORMULA vir FORMULA 2.5FORMULA vir FORMULA 3FORMULA M1.2mm 0.35  MFORMULA vir < 2FORMULA 2FORMULA +FORMULA vir FORMULA 2.5FORMULA We conclude that a large majority (FORMULA  75-90FORMULA )
of the L1688
condensations detected in NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0),
including FORMULA  90FORMULA  of those more massive
than FORMULA ,
are likely gravitationally boundNote that the surface pressure term of
the virial theorem, which we neglect here, tends to reduce the mass required for virial
equilibrium, i.e., to increase the value of FORMULA  expected in virial equilibrium
– see {{cite:69ed25c6-ed6f-4d63-bd77-935ad756455f}}..
Coupled with the detection of signatures of infall motions toward some of them
(see Sect. REF ), this supports the notion that
FORMULA  of the starless condensations identified by {{cite:66ab4ffe-19d2-449a-a753-482cc5c04ebb}}
at 1.2 mm are prestellar in nature and on the verge of forming protostars
(cf. {{cite:7ecd1fee-fa19-44a1-8f58-f2afb6b49ea3}} 2000 and {{cite:850f01d3-ce48-4e9c-9f3d-f269e44367d0}} 2007 for a definition of the prestellar stage).

Lifetime of the L1688 condensations
The lifetime of the L1688 prestellar condensations is rather uncertain but
several lines of reasoning suggest a typical value of FORMULA  yr.
Table REF  provides estimates of some relevant evolutionary timescales.
First, based on the measured mean densities FORMULA ,
the free-fall dynamical timescales of the condensations, FORMULA ,
range from FORMULA  yr to FORMULA  yr.
While some of the condensations show evidence of infall motions, most of them are
unlikely to be in free-fall collapse. We may conservatively estimate their evolutionary
timescale to be FORMULA , which is appropriate for magnetically supercritical
dense cores {{cite:64a09ac6-a619-43be-8ca2-60c80d510ec4}} and typical of isolated prestellar cores detected
in the submillimeter continuum {{cite:5429d803-924c-479b-b81a-67539326c6e8}}.
This leads to timescale values ranging from FORMULA  yr to FORMULA  yr
(cf. col. [6] of Table REF ).
Second, assuming that the L1688 condensations evolve into stellar systems at a constant
rate, we may derive a rough statistical estimate of their lifetime (col. [7] of Table REF )
by comparing the number of observed prestellar condensations (col. [3] of Table REF )
to the number of pre-main sequence (PMS) systems found in the same region (col. [2] of Table REF ).
The ISOCAM mid-IR survey of {{cite:eb02664d-bcd7-4ac1-a404-edd679c12d10}} revealed a total of 109 Class II PMS
objects in L1688 with ages FORMULA  Myr. If all of the 45 starless condensations identified
by {{cite:66ab4ffe-19d2-449a-a753-482cc5c04ebb}} above FORMULA  are truly prestellar in nature, this points
to a prestellar lifetime FORMULA  yr.
A third timescale estimate may be obtained by dividing the typical condensation outer radius
FORMULA  AU by a typical infall speed FORMULA  km/s {{cite:ba0ee960-1ce7-404c-81cd-94c6c406d320}}.
This approach yields a condensation lifetime FORMULA  yr.
We conclude that the 1.2mm continuum condensations of L1688 are likely characterized
by a range of lifetimes between FORMULA  yr and FORMULA  yr
(see col. [6] and col. [7] of Table REF ).
FIGURE 
As pointed out by {{cite:a1f50999-3cec-48a8-8bf7-9406483a8727}},
if the lifetime of the condensations depends
on their mass, then the observed mass spectrum is not necessarily representative of the intrinsic
condensation mass distribution (CMD) {{cite:53da9466-b31a-4391-8f58-20bf44f28679}}.
This is due to the fact that an observer
is more likely to detect long-lived condensations than short-lived condensations.
Here, however, the mean densities of the L1688 condensations are essentially uncorrelated with
their masses, so that there is no systematic dependence of the dynamical timescale on the mass.
To quantify the importance of the potential timescale bias, we plot, in Fig. REF ,
a weighted version of the central Ophiuchus CMD in which each condensation was assigned
a weight equal to FORMULA  (instead of 1 as used for
Fig. REF ), where FORMULA  is
the average free-fall time of the condensations.
Such a weighting should allow us to recover the intrinsic shape of the CMD assuming that the lifetime of
each condensation is proportional to its free-fall time.
As can be seen in Fig. REF , this weighting does not change the high-mass end of the CMD
and only affects the low-mass end. We conclude that the steep, Salpeter-like slope of the CMD
at the high-mass end is robust, but that the presence of a break at FORMULA  is
less robust.
TABLE 

Likelihood of interactions between condensations
Using the velocity dispersions derived for the condensations in Sect. REF  and
the lifetime estimates of Sect. REF  above, we are now in a position to assess
whether dynamical interactions between condensations are a frequent or rare phenomenon
in the L1688 protocluster.
Assuming an isotropic, Maxwellian velocity distribution,
the time, FORMULA , required for a condensation to interact or collide with another
condensation can be estimated from the following formula for the collision rate
FORMULA  :
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the number density of condensations,
FORMULA  is the condensation outer radius (which we take to be
twice the measured HWHM radius at 1.2mm - cf. Sect. REF ),
FORMULA  is the collisional cross section
of the condensation, and FORMULA 
is the gravitational focusing factor {{cite:1187ab0b-4664-4159-b8f4-deac5036c3d2}}.
Further assuming that the condensations are homogeneously distributed in a spherical system
of radius FORMULA , so that FORMULA , the ratio
of FORMULA  to FORMULA  takes on the simple form:
FORMULA 
Using the above equation for the entire L1688 cluster-forming clump (FORMULA  pc, FORMULA , FORMULA  km sFORMULA )
and adopting typical condensation properties (FORMULA  AU and FORMULA ), we find
FORMULA  and thus FORMULA  yr.
The latter is two orders
of magnitude larger than the estimated lifetime of the condensations (Sect. REF )
and about one order of magnitude longer than the age of the L1688 PMS cluster
{{cite:eb02664d-bcd7-4ac1-a404-edd679c12d10}}.
For simplicity, our analysis ignores the dynamical impact of the ambient protocluster environment.
In such a dense environment, gas drag is likely to have an effect on the motions of individual condensations,
which will make the associated velocity field depart from a true Maxwellian distribution. A detailed assessment
of the effects of gas drag is beyond the scope of this paper, but qualitatively at least we expect the environment
to make the interaction timescales even longer than the above estimates.
We conclude that
the interaction process is much too slow on the scale of the entire L1688
system to play any significant role in the evolution of the protocluster condensations.
Dynamical interactions are however more likely to occur on smaller scales than the whole L1688 cluster-forming clump.
In their mid-IR census of the PMS cluster, {{cite:eb02664d-bcd7-4ac1-a404-edd679c12d10}} identified three main sub-clusters associated with
the DCOFORMULA  cores Oph A, Oph B1/B2, and Oph C/E/F, respectively. The fact that sub-clustering is observed in the spatial
distribution of PMS objects further supports our conclusion that significant interactions between individual objects
have not yet occurred on the scale of the entire protocluster.
Using Eq. (2) for the condensations associated with each of the three sub-cluster
systems (FORMULA  pc, FORMULA ),
we find shorter interaction timescales than for L1688 as a whole,
FORMULA  yr (see col. [9] of Table REF ).
The derived collision timescales nevertheless remain significantly longer than the
typical condensation lifetime FORMULA  yr,
indicating that dynamical interactions between condensations cannot be a dominant process even on the scale of the
sub-clusters and DCOFORMULA  cloud cores.
The collision timescales are even longer than the combined lifetime of the prestellar and protostellar (Class 0/Class I)
phases, which we estimate to be at most FORMULA  yr {{cite:770afa9a-2404-4a11-ba8a-4ee75f78cc81}}.
In general, therefore, the prestellar condensations do not have
time to orbit through their parent DCOFORMULA  core and collide with one another before evolving into Class II PMS objects.
We note that FORMULA  is only slightly larger than FORMULA  yr
in the case of the Oph A
cluster-forming core, suggesting that a few interactions may occur during the whole evolution of this sub-cluster.
Interestingly, based on a recent detailed study of the NGC 2264-C cluster-forming clump in the Mon OB1 complex,
{{cite:0bc0fdb5-2cd6-4679-9946-27eb0069224e}} found direct evidence of a strong dynamical interaction in the dense inner region of that
protocluster. However, the interaction observed at the center of NGC 2264-C is purely gravitational in origin and
results from large-scale, coherent collapse motions as opposed to random turbulent motions {{cite:759b5059-3230-440c-916d-f218bbf5621c}}.
Our present results in L1688 seem inconsistent with models which resort to
strong dynamical interactions
to build up a mass spectrum comparable to the IMF {{cite:dd0cf869-5a41-4d1f-855c-fc80ab3c0616}}.
TABLE 

Comparison with the competitive accretion picture
In a scenario of clustered star formation proposed by
Bonnell, Bate and collaborators {{cite:76a2f7a4-3fc3-4e9e-8d52-81d62abb6481}}, {{cite:bf83cad5-432f-4c4e-929b-77f71a1280b8}},
the IMF is primarily determined by competitive accretion and dynamical
interactions/ejections during the protostellar phase, corresponding observationally to
Class 0 and Class I objects. In this picture, turbulence generates density fluctuations
within molecular clouds, some of which are gravitationally unstable and collapse to
interacting protostars or protostellar seeds.
The initial envelope/core masses of these protostars are essentially uncorrelated with the
corresponding final stellar masses, especially at the high-mass end of the IMF
{{cite:69bbaf9b-1bee-44ed-a15e-bba5963ab20d}}.
The protostars acquire most of their mass by moving around in the
gravitational potential well of the parent cluster-forming clump and accreting background gas
that initially did not belong to the corresponding protostellar envelopes/cores.
This process of competitive accretion of background gas is highly non-uniform and depends
primarily on the initial stellar position FORMULA  within the protocluster.
The few protostars initially located near the center of the
cluster potential accrete rapidly from the start and
become massive stars, while protostars in the low-density
outer regions accrete much more slowly and become low-mass stars
{{cite:bf83cad5-432f-4c4e-929b-77f71a1280b8}}.
In the context of this scenario, it is difficult to explain why the Ophiuchus
prestellar condensations have a mass distribution resembling the IMF.
Our present results on the kinematics
of the protocluster condensations allow us to further discuss the possible relevance of
the competitive accretion picture in the case of the L1688 embedded cluster.
The rate at which a protostar accretes mass competitively as it travels through
the background protocluster gas is FORMULA 
{{cite:76a2f7a4-3fc3-4e9e-8d52-81d62abb6481}}, which gives:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the background gas density, FORMULA  is the relative
velocity between the protostar and the local ambient gas, and FORMULA  is the accretion radius.
{{cite:76a2f7a4-3fc3-4e9e-8d52-81d62abb6481}} have shown that a good analytic approximation for FORMULA 
is provided by the smaller of the Bondi-Hoyle radius, FORMULA ,
and the local tidal-lobe radius,
FORMULA ,
where FORMULA  is the gas sound speed and FORMULA  is the mass enclosed within the protocluster at the
protostar's position FORMULA .
The Bondi-Hoyle radius, FORMULA , is the radius where the gravitational potential due to the protostar
exceeds the kinetic energy of the gas. Here, we estimate the relative gas–protostar velocity to be
the derived mean condensation speed FORMULA  km sFORMULA  < FORMULA 2  csFORMULA RBH 9900  AU  (M/0.5  M) (vrel /0.3  km/s )-2FORMULA RtidalFORMULA Rtidal FORMULA RBH FORMULA Racc RtidalFORMULA RBH FORMULA RtidalFORMULA Racc RBHFORMULA To estimate the typical value of FORMULA  in the central Ophiuchus case, we assume that the overall gas distribution in
the centrally-condensed L1688 protocluster and individual subclusters (e.g. Oph A)
follows a FORMULA  density profile on average.
This assumption is consistent with the density gradient derived by {{cite:66ab4ffe-19d2-449a-a753-482cc5c04ebb}}
for the outer parts of the DCOFORMULA  cores based on the circularly-averaged profiles observed
at 1.2mm.
Under this assumption, FORMULA  has a very simple
expression, FORMULA ,
and thus FORMULA ,
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the total (gas FORMULA  stars) mass and outer radius of the
protocluster, respectively.
For the entire L1688 protocluster, we have FORMULA , FORMULA  pc,
and thus FORMULA .
For the Oph A subcluster, we adopt FORMULA , FORMULA  pc,
and thus FORMULA .
As expected, we see that FORMULA  and thus FORMULA .
Based on these simple estimates, we find that the typical tidal-lobe radius of the
L1688 condensations/protostars is comparable to the actual radius of the condensations
and protostellar envelopes as measured by {{cite:66ab4ffe-19d2-449a-a753-482cc5c04ebb}} at 1.2 mm.
This suggests that the overall gravitational potential of the L1688 protocluster
does play an important role in limiting
the condensation/envelope masses, in qualitative agreement with the competitive accretion
picture {{cite:76a2f7a4-3fc3-4e9e-8d52-81d62abb6481}}, {{cite:69bbaf9b-1bee-44ed-a15e-bba5963ab20d}}. Note that the small value found here for
the mean condensation velocity relative to the local gas (FORMULA  km sFORMULA )
is also consistent with the predictions of the competitive accretion model during the gas-dominated
phase of protocluster evolution {{cite:76a2f7a4-3fc3-4e9e-8d52-81d62abb6481}}.
However, when we estimate the mass accretion rate resulting from competitive accretion
in various typical situations, we find relatively low values (see Table REF ),
which are smaller than the infall rate expected from the gravitational collapse
of individual condensations, i.e., FORMULA 
(see {{cite:4ea39c36-4545-40d4-af6b-479934c41edb}} 1977 and {{cite:a5ec6147-99d9-48d8-a6e9-37540b7bc242}} 1993 for model predictions,
and {{cite:4b6e791e-4138-428b-a334-bf544a7b4ecf}} 2006 for an observed example).
For a Class 0 protostar such as VLA 1623 embedded in the inner part of the Oph A DCOFORMULA  core, we estimate
the background gas density to be relatively high, FORMULA ,
and the tidal radius to be at most
FORMULA , giving FORMULA .
For comparison, the
infall rate due to gravitational collapse is significantly higher at this early stage
FORMULA  > FORMULA 10  cs3/G FORMULA 10-5-10-4  M  yr-1FORMULA +FORMULA nH2back 5 104  cm-3 FORMULA RtidalIRS43 3000  AUFORMULA  Macc 6 10-7  M  yr-1FORMULA Minf cs3/G 2 10-6  M  yr-1FORMULA  Macc < Minf/3FORMULA We also believe that competitive, Bondi-like accretion is more likely to operate at the prestellar stage and may
possibly govern the growth of starless condensations within a cluster-forming
cloud {{cite:bf83cad5-432f-4c4e-929b-77f71a1280b8}}, {{cite:0ace9f39-6f17-4f89-98bf-960dc6f3adb7}}, {{cite:b8b8117c-cda1-412d-bc79-1efbdd16bba3}}.
The growth rate of a typical FORMULA  condensation embedded in the inner part of a DCOFORMULA  core such as Oph A
should be similar to the competitive accretion rate estimated above for VLA 1623, i.e.,
FORMULA . This is sufficient to approximately double the mass
of the condensation in FORMULA  yr, a timescale comparable to the condensation lifetime.
However, once fast, nearly free-fall collapse sets in, we expect the growth rate to be quickly overwhelmed by
the infall rate, so that a collapsing prestellar condensation should not have time to grow significantly in mass before
evolving into a PMS system.
Another feature of the dynamics of a gas-dominated protocluster
is that the entire system is expected to undergo global collapse/contraction,
resulting in a centrally-condensed overall structure much like a self-gravitating
isothermal sphere {{cite:ca1afc9f-301a-4d56-a655-080673c60297}}, {{cite:bf83cad5-432f-4c4e-929b-77f71a1280b8}}. In this view,
both the gas accretion and the protocluster evolution occur on the global dynamical
timescale {{cite:aaa8bdc1-9b8a-4143-bd64-eefdfcd114e3}}.
Observationally, the velocity dispersion, FORMULA , estimated in Sect. REF 
above for the L1688 condensations implies a binding virial mass
FORMULA , which is much less than
the total gas mass FORMULA  of the associated CFORMULA O cloud
{{cite:ff65f405-29d8-4382-aa42-1f1e21f4a470}} and even less than the total stellar mass of
the present infrared embedded cluster
{{cite:eb02664d-bcd7-4ac1-a404-edd679c12d10}}.
In other words, the observed condensation-to-condensation velocity dispersion is
a factor of FORMULA  smaller than that expected in virial equilibrium {{cite:0bc0fdb5-2cd6-4679-9946-27eb0069224e}},
Since the magnetic field does not seem to be strong enough to support the
cloud {{cite:0bcedb03-3b94-4040-93b6-4ac7117833d3}}, this comparison suggests that the L1688 system is indeed
gravitationally unstable and possibly in an early state of large-scale, magnetically supercritical
contraction.
Interestingly, the CO and FORMULA CO lines
observed toward the L1688 cloud exhibit the classical spectroscopic
signature of contraction motions (cf. Sect. REF  above) over most of the
protocluster extent {{cite:6561d7af-8c84-4396-a756-a7c50493e69a}}.
We also note that L1688 is not the only protocluster for which both subvirial relative speeds and evidence
of large-scale contraction have been found. Two other examples are NGC 2264
{{cite:0bc0fdb5-2cd6-4679-9946-27eb0069224e}}, {{cite:759b5059-3230-440c-916d-f218bbf5621c}} and NGC 1333 {{cite:bd47cae7-8f7c-4338-85a8-4c7f5837310c}}, {{cite:374c3841-c9ab-4f10-b98f-2218eca2d29f}}.
This suggests that protoclusters often start their evolution from “cold”, out-of-equilibrium
initial conditions {{cite:e2e6dfa2-99e8-40c8-b007-30682ef33add}}, possibly as a result of the influence of external triggers {{cite:b2b2dd5b-54a0-4936-828f-987555c1ce9f}}.

Summary and conclusions
We carried out a detailed observational study of the kinematics of the L1688 protocluster
condensations in the central Ophiuchus molecular cloud
using NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0) as a tracer of dense gas. Additional observations
were also taken in molecular lines such as HFORMULA COFORMULA (1-0), DCOFORMULA (2-1), HCOFORMULA (3-2),
CS(2-1), and CFORMULA S(2-1).
Our main results and conclusions are as follows:

The NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0) line was positively detected toward 41 of the 57 compact starless
condensations identified by {{cite:66ab4ffe-19d2-449a-a753-482cc5c04ebb}} at 1.2 mm, as well as 3 Class 0/Class I protostars
(VLA 1623, CRBR 85, YLW 15/IRS 43). The same objects were also detected in HFORMULA COFORMULA (1-0)
and/or DCOFORMULA (2-1) when observed in these transitions. In addition, the Class I sources LFAM 26
and GY210 were detected in HFORMULA COFORMULA (1-0).

For 29 of the 44
condensations/protostars detected in NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0) we are confident that the line emission
is at least partly associated with the compact 1.2 mm continuum object as opposed to the more extended
parent cloud/DCOFORMULA  core, since the sources remained positively detected after subtraction of the local
background line emission. Furthermore, at least 17 starless condensations and 3 protostars were found
to have well-defined line counterparts in position-velocity space and could be identified in our
background-subtracted NFORMULA HFORMULA (101-012), HFORMULA COFORMULA (1-0), or DCOFORMULA (2-1) data cubes
using the Gaussclumps clump-finding algorithm of {{cite:6b1b878f-cc52-4a1a-ace2-d511d1e70730}}.

The measured NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0) linewidths are narrow, indicative of
small nonthermal velocity dispersions. The condensations of Oph A, Oph B1, Oph C, Oph E, and Oph F
are characterized by subsonic levels of internal turbulence (FORMULA ), while
the condensations of Oph B2 have at most “transonic” internal turbulence (FORMULA ).

We detected the classical spectroscopic signature of infall motions toward six 1.2 mm continuum
condensations (A-SM2, B2-MM16, C-MM5, C-MM6, E-MM2d, and E-MM4). For these objects,
the optically thick CS(2–1), CS(3–2), HFORMULA CO(FORMULA ), and/or HCOFORMULA (3–2) lines are double-peaked
with a stronger blue peak, while the low-optical-depth NFORMULA HFORMULA (101–012) line peaks
in the dip of the optically thick line. The same signature was tentatively observed in 10 other condensations.

The virial masses derived from our NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0) detections of the condensations
generally agree within a factor of FORMULA  with the masses estimated from the 1.2 mm dust continuum.
On this basis, most (FORMULA  75-90FORMULA ) of the L1688 condensations detected in NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0),
including essentially all (FORMULA ) of those more massive than FORMULA ,
appear to be gravitationally bound and prestellar in nature.
The status of the starless 1.2 mm condensations less massive than FORMULA  is less clear
since these were often undetected in NFORMULA HFORMULA .

We estimate that the prestellar condensations of L1688 are characterized by a range of lifetimes
between FORMULA  yr and FORMULA  yr. There is however no systematic dependence
of lifetime on mass, so that the observed mass spectrum is not severely affected by the timescale bias pointed out
by {{cite:a1f50999-3cec-48a8-8bf7-9406483a8727}}. In particular, the steep, Salpeter-like slope of the condensation mass distribution at
the high-mass end appears to be robust.

Based on the observed distribution of NFORMULA HFORMULA (1-0) line centroid velocities, a global
velocity dispersion FORMULA  km sFORMULA  was estimated for the condensations of L1688.
This condensation-to-condensation velocity dispersion is subvirial.
It implies a crossing time FORMULA  Myr for the condensations
within the parent protocluster and a typical collision time FORMULA  Myr between condensations.
Since these timescales are longer than the estimated condensation lifetime FORMULA  0.2-5 FORMULA  yr, we
conclude that, in general, the L1688 prestellar condensations
do not have time to orbit through their parent
DCOFORMULA  core and interact with one another before evolving into PMS objects.

Using an estimated mean relative velocity of FORMULA  km sFORMULA  between protostellar envelopes
and the background ambient gas, the mass accretion rate expected from competitive accretion was found to be
significantly smaller than that resulting from gravitational collapse at the Class 0 stage. On the other hand,
the typical tidal-lobe radius of the L1688 condensations/protostars was estimated to be comparable to the
actual radius of the condensations and protostellar envelopes as measured in the dust continuum at 1.2 mm.
This suggests that the overall gravitational potential of the protocluster does play an important role
in limiting the condensation/envelope masses, but that competitive accretion at the protostellar stage
is not the dominant mechanism responsible for determining the final masses of stellar systems
in the central Ophiuchus star-forming cloud.

We find that competitive, Bondi-like accretion is more likely to operate at the prestellar stage and
propose that it may partly govern the growth of starless, self-gravitating condensations initially produced
by gravoturbulent fragmentation toward an IMF, Salpeter-like mass spectrum.

We would like to thank Bruce Elmegreen and Ian Bonnell for enlightening discussions on
protocluster dynamics. We are grateful to an anonymous referee for constructive comments
that helped us improve the clarity of the paper.
