We construct a calculable model of electroweak symmetry breaking
in which the Higgs doublet emerges from the meta-stable SUSY
breaking sector as a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson. The Higgs boson
mass is further protected by the little Higgs mechanism, and
naturally suppressed by a two-loop factor from the SUSY breaking
scale of 10 TeV. Gaugino and sfermion masses arise from standard
gauge mediation, but the Higgsino obtains a tree-level mass at the
SUSY breaking scale. At 1 TeV, aside from new gauge bosons and fermions similar to other little Higgs models and their superpartners, our model predicts additional electroweak triplets and doublets from the SUSY
breaking sector.

Introduction
Dynamical supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking has always been difficult
due to the existence of nonzero Witten index of supersymmetric
pure gauge theories {{cite:f08ded66-e318-407c-b29e-de200bba5158}}. It was believed before
that gauge theories breaking SUSY dynamically must either be
chiral or have massless matter {{cite:bd949c91-1c68-4fa1-aa94-f5c0e2ce385d}}. Models built
along this line turn out to be rather baroque. The situation is
greatly improved by the recent discovery of long-lived metastable
SUSY breaking vacua in FORMULA  supersymmetric QCD theory by
Intriligator, Seiberg and Shih (ISS) {{cite:60127b6b-3c50-4fcc-a6f3-134b83132ceb}}.
The ISS model opens up new possibilities to build realistic
models. Using ISS's idea, a number of new and simple models have
been constructed to communicate SUSY breaking (directly) to the
standard model {{cite:8dd89b67-fc42-4c82-834d-0cb28037ac4a}} .
In an interesting attempt, the ISS model is embedded into the
supersymmetric standard model by extending the Higgs
sector {{cite:c3786171-727d-47c5-b39c-1fd49a11421b}}. But in that work, a strong coupling
in the Higgs sector is needed to generate sufficiently large
gluino masses. In this paper we will construct an electroweak
symmetry breaking model with a weakly coupled Higgs sector
embedded inside the meta-stable SUSY breaking sector.
In our model, the soft masses of gauginos and sferminos are
generated by the standard gauge mediation. To obtain the soft
masses above a few hundred GeV, the lowest allowed SUSY breaking
scale is of order 10 TeV. We take two identical ISS sectors with
FORMULA  massive fundamental flavors and set the SUSY breaking and
the global FORMULA  breaking scale FORMULA  to be of order 10 TeV. We
then gauge the diagonal subgroup FORMULA  of the
unbroken global symmetry FORMULA . By adding Yukawa couplings with
extra vector-like fermions, both of the FORMULA  symmetries are
spontaneously broken at the scale FORMULA . At the same time the gauge symmetry is broken to
the electroweak symmetry. Among the resulting Goldstone boson
fields, one doublet is eaten by the heavy gauge bosons, while the
other doublet is a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson (PNGB) and
identified as the Higgs doublet (this Higgs doublet is a light
linear combination of the two doublets FORMULA  and FORMULA  in the minimal
supersymmetric standard model). The one-loop effective potential
of the Higgs doublet also breaks electroweak symmetry at FORMULA  and gives a
light Higgs boson with a mass from 100 GeV to 200 GeV. In short,
all the mass scales arise from one single scale FORMULA  in our
model. Since the scale FORMULA  can be generated
dynamically {{cite:1acc6f08-6890-4d42-b595-93c9e08d15c8}}, the hierarchy between the
electroweak scale and the Planck scale may also be explained.
Below the SUSY breaking scale, the “collective symmetry breaking
mechanism" protects the Higgs boson mass as in the little Higgs
models {{cite:4d52c714-601a-4cc9-b589-5a8f26b06445}}. Then in our model, like in the
super-little Higgs models {{cite:23cd9fd3-b8bc-4f4a-8fa0-5b46d047390f}} {{cite:e7abbbfa-8be3-4ba7-b92b-687b1bb8838e}},
the Higgs boson mass is doubly protected by both SUSY and the
little Higgs mechanism, and the fine-tuning problem has been
alleviated compared to the minimal supersymmetric standard model.
However, unlike the super-little Higgs models where the soft
masses are introduced by hand, all the soft masses in our model
are calculable. Our model contains new gauge bosons and fermions
at 1 TeV that are also present in other little Higgs models.
Furthermore, our model predicts additional electroweak triplets
and doublets at 1 TeV from the psedu-moduli in the meta-stable
SUSY breaking sector.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we will briefly
review the ISS model, its symmetries and its field content. In
Sec. III we present our model and describe how to break
FORMULA  to FORMULA . In Sec. IV we
explain how to break the electroweak symmetry. We address the
vacuum alignment and order one quartic Higgs coupling issues. We
also explicitly minimize the full effective scalar potential to
support our step-by-step analysis. In Sec. V we discuss the soft
masses of gauginos and sferminos generated via gauge interactions.
In Sec. VI we provide a sample of the mass spectrum of our model.
We conclude in Sec. VII.

Meta-stable SUSY breaking
The ISS model is a deformed FORMULA  supersymmetric FORMULA  QCD,
with FORMULA  massive fundamental flavors. FORMULA  is taken to be in
the free magnetic range, FORMULA  for a
controllable IR description of the theory. For concreteness, we
will concentrate on the simplest model FORMULA  where the
magnetic gauge group is trivial.
In terms of the superfields with normalized kinetic terms
 TABLE ,
the low-energy effective superpotential we study is
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is a dimensionless parameter of order one; FORMULA  is
related to a holomorphic scale FORMULA  of the microscopic
theory, but much smaller than FORMULA . FORMULA  are identified as mesons, baryons and
antibaryons of the electric theory. In addition, there is an
instanton generated operator FORMULA . For
FORMULA , this term is irrelevant and will be neglected in
discussions of the physics around the origin of FORMULA . Thus,
below we will set FORMULA . The reason for this choice will be
discussed later.
The F-terms of the meson field FORMULA  are
FORMULA 
SUSY is broken since FORMULA  has rank one while
FORMULA  has rank FORMULA . Up to global transformations,
the vacua are
FORMULA 
In these vacua, the global symmetry is broken to
FORMULA .
To see what the light fields are, we expand around
Eq. (REF ) using the following parametrization
FORMULA 
where the component fields transform under the unbroken global
symmetry as
 TABLE
and FORMULA  has a non-zero F-term
FORMULA 
Another two fields, corresponding
to the Cartan generators in the adjoint representation, have
nonzero F-terms as well.
To identify the Goldstone fields, we use the following non-linear
parametrization of scalar fields
FORMULA 
with
FORMULA 
To the leading order, FORMULA  and FORMULA  are related to FORMULA , FORMULA  as
FORMULA 
The scalar mass spectrum is
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the heavy combination of the triplets FORMULA ,
while the massless combination FORMULA  together with the singlet FORMULA  are the seven Nambu-Goldstone bosons (NGB)'s in
the coset space FORMULA . FORMULA  are pseudo moduli and obtain masses of order
FORMULA  through the one-loop Coleman-Weinberg
potential
FORMULA 
In the UV regime, the instanton term in the superpotential can not
be neglected and is crucial to generate supersymetric vacua
FORMULA . The
distance in field space between the local vacua and the global
minima is controlled by a small parameter FORMULA , and thus
the meta-stable vacuum can have a lifetime much longer than the
age of the Universe.

The model
The ISS model provides a way to break SUSY and can be used to
construct a gauge mediation model, where the soft masses of
gauginos and sfermions are roughly of the same scale,
FORMULA . Here, FORMULA  are the gauge
coupling constants in the standard model, FORMULA  is the value of an
F-term indicating SUSY breaking and FORMULA  is the supersymmetric mass
of the messenger. As the superpartner masses are of order 100 GeV
or more, we need to have FORMULA  TeV. To avoid tachyonic
directions of the messenger fields, FORMULA  and the lowest
allowed scale of FORMULA  is of order FORMULA .
Since the Higgs boson mass is likely to be FORMULA , it
has to be at least two-loop factor below the SUSY breaking scale
in the ISS model. Below the SUSY breaking scale, we introduce the
collective symmetry breaking mechanism as in little Higgs models
to protect the mass of the Higgs boson. In the simplest little
Higgs model {{cite:dd1ae3ea-e02a-4e87-83c8-7be8680e3926}}, the Higgs boson mass is
lighter than the FORMULA 's breaking scale FORMULA  TeV by a
factor of FORMULA . For our purpose, we need to achieve the
FORMULA 's breaking scale FORMULA  one loop factor lower than the SUSY
breaking scale FORMULA  TeV.
To achieve this purpose and to have enough light degrees of
freedom containing the Higgs doublet as a PNGB, we adopt two ISS
sectors with FORMULA  global symmetry. For simplicity, we choose
two identical ISS sectors by imposing a FORMULA  symmetry between
them. In each ISS sector, the global symmetry FORMULA  and SUSY are
broken at the same scale, FORMULA , where the coupling
FORMULA  in the ISS sectors is chosen to be of order one. Then there
are two massless triplets FORMULA  and FORMULA , which are the NGB's in
each sector. Hence, the effective field theory below FORMULA 
resembles the simplest little Higgs model with the unbroken global symmetry FORMULA . After
gauging the diagonal FORMULA  subgroup, FORMULA  and
FORMULA  become PNGB's. We will later introduce a superpotential to
spontaneously break the approximate global FORMULA  symmetry to
FORMULA . The Higgs doublet is a PNGB and contained in the light
triplets as
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are broken at the same scale
FORMULA ; FORMULA  is chosen to have properly normalized kinetic term
of the Higgs doublet.
Higgs sector and D-term
For the two identical ISS sectors, the superpotential is
FORMULA 
The symmetry breaking and the vacua in both
sectors are the same as described in
section .
The parametrization around the ISS vacua are then
FORMULA 
where FORMULA . The unbroken global symmetry is
FORMULA . The
diagonal subgroup of this global symmetry is gauged and denoted as
FORMULA  with the electroweak gauge group as a
subgroup. Under the gauge symmetries, the field content in the
Higgs sector is described in Table  REF
TABLE 
The D-term potential of FORMULA  preserves the global
FORMULA  symmetry, so it will not give a potential
to the Higgs doublet and we neglect it here. To study the Higgs
doublet potential, we ignore fields FORMULA , FORMULA  and
FORMULA  and only consider the following part of the FORMULA 
D-term potential
FORMULA 
where in the second line we expand the D-term potential in terms
of FORMULA , which are defined in section ; FORMULA  is
the FORMULA  gauge coupling; FORMULA  are the gererators of
FORMULA  and FORMULA ; the dots
represent other FORMULA  preserving terms and do
not contain quartic terms of FORMULA  and FORMULA . Substituting
FORMULA , the D-term does not provide a
self-interaction potential of FORMULA  and the Higgs doublet at tree
level (the Higgs doublet is embedded in FORMULA  as in
Eq. (REF )). Actually, this result comes from
the same vacuum expectation values (VEV)'s of FORMULA  and
FORMULA  in the ISS model. After integrating out the heavy
modes, the one-loop effective potential of the two light triplets
from the gauge interaction is of the form
FORMULA 
where order one numbers are neglected in the parenthesis.
Substituting the parameterization of FORMULA  and FORMULA  in
Eq. (REF ) into this potential, the Higgs
doublet mass is FORMULA  and it is at most of order 100 GeV.

Breaking FORMULA  to  FORMULA
To spontaneously break the global FORMULA  symmetries, we employ the trick of adding vector-like fermions
that has been widely used in the little Higgs model building. The
superpotential we propose is
FORMULA 
where the superfields FORMULA  and FORMULA  with FORMULA . Here FORMULA  and FORMULA  are top and bottom left-handed quarks. The charge assignments of those new fields are listed in Table REF .
TABLE 
We only list fields in the top sector, which provides the
dominate contribution to the Higgs doublet mass. The full list of
fields without gauge anomalies can be found in {{cite:23cd9fd3-b8bc-4f4a-8fa0-5b46d047390f}}.
In order not to change the “rank condition" of the ISS model and
not to generate VEV's for the FORMULA  charged fields, the
following relation among Yukawa couplings must be satisfied
FORMULA 
Other than the superpotential in Eq. (REF ), we also need an
additional superpotential to generate order one quartic couplings
for FORMULA  and FORMULA . We introduce extra singlets FORMULA 's which
couple to FORMULA  and FORMULA  as
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is of order one. This superpotential is FORMULA 
invariant and contains operators FORMULA  and FORMULA  at
tree level. Additional operators like FORMULA  from this superpotential do not provide a self-interaction potential of FORMULA  at tree level, but they contribute to the masses of FORMULA  at one-loop level. We will neglect their contributions by choosing FORMULA  to be smaller than the Yukawa couplings in Eq. (REF ).
From Eq. (REF ), we calculate the one-loop
Coleman-Weinberg potential for those light triplets FORMULA  and
FORMULA . Together with the order one quartic couplings, the
potential of those two triplets is
FORMULA 
The fermion and scalar mass matrices are too complicated
to be diagonalized analytically, and hence we present a
numerical study here. Choosing FORMULA , FORMULA  (satisfying the condition in
Eq. (REF )) and FORMULA , we plot the triplet potential along the FORMULA  direction in
Fig. REF .
FIGURE 
Fig. REF  shows that
the triplet FORMULA  develops a nonzero VEV at FORMULA , which
parametrically is
FORMULA 
and breaks FORMULA  to
FORMULA . A similar result can be obtained for
FORMULA  to break FORMULA  to FORMULA .
A few comments are in order about the superpotential in
Eq. (REF ) and Fig. REF :

The scale FORMULA  on the vertical axis of
Fig. REF  comes from the product of the
one-loop suppression factor and small values of FORMULA  near the minimum.

The potential of FORMULA  is periodic as FORMULA  are PNGB's. It is
found that the minimum in Fig. REF  is the
global one, so we only consider the parameter space near the
origin.

If the operator FORMULA  were generated in our
effective potential, naive dimensional analysis suggests it would
give an FORMULA  contribution to the Higgs doublet mass. However,
our superpotential preserves the FORMULA  symmetry
which forbids the FORMULA  term.

The gauge couplings are smaller than the Yukawa couplings in Eq. (REF ), so we neglect the contributions from the gauge interactions to the potential of FORMULA  in Fig. REF .

Logarithmic divergence for the one loop potential of the
triplets from Eq. (REF ) is absent. This is due to the
double protection of SUSY and the collective symmetry breaking
mechanism on the masses of PNGB's or triplets here. Without SUSY,
more than one Yukawa coupling is needed to generate a potential
for PNGB's, and then there is not any quardratic divergent
potential for the PNGB's at one loop. SUSY protects the mass of
PNGB's furthermore and leaves us one finite potential for those
triplets at one loop.

After FORMULA  and FORMULA  develop nonzero VEV's as FORMULA 
(the alignment issue will be discussed later), the global symmetry FORMULA 
spontaneously breaks to FORMULA  and generates two doublets as NGB's. The gauge
symmetry FORMULA  spontaneously breaks to FORMULA .
One of those two NGB doublets is eaten by the gauge bosons, FORMULA 's and FORMULA ,
and the other one becomes a PNGB, which is the Higgs doublet in our model and
parameterized in Eq. (REF ). The D-term also gives an additional
mass to one linear combination of FORMULA  and FORMULA  to complete the “super Higgs mechanism".

Electroweak symmetry breaking
Other than providing negative mass terms to FORMULA  and FORMULA , the
one-loop Coleman-Weinberg potential of FORMULA  calculated from Eq. (REF ) also contains an operator,
FORMULA , with a positive FORMULA 
coefficient. For example, using the same values of Yukawa
couplings as in the previous section, the coefficient is
FORMULA . Substituting the parametrization of FORMULA  and
FORMULA  in terms of the Higgs doublet in Eq. (REF ), we have
FORMULA 
Here FORMULA . The Higgs doublet mass is negative and the
electroweak symmetry successively breaks to FORMULA .
However, this result is based on the assumption that the VEV's of
FORMULA  and FORMULA  are aligned (the VEV's of both triplets have only
nonzero values at the third entries). Therefore, we need to address
the vacuum alignment issue first.
Vacuum alignment
Although the operator FORMULA  with a positive
coefficient gives a negative mass to the Higgs doublet, it prefers
anti-aligned VEV's of FORMULA  and FORMULA . Thus, we need to introduce
a new operator together with FORMULA  to achieve the
alignment and a negative mass for the Higgs doublet at the same
time. One possibility is to include an operator, FORMULA , which is the only operator explicitly
breaking one linear combination of FORMULA .
Therefore, the coefficient FORMULA  can be as small as possible
and we choose it to be FORMULA . Combining the FORMULA -term
potential of FORMULA  and FORMULA , we have
FORMULA  breaking parts of the potential as
FORMULA 
where we define FORMULA  and the positive FORMULA  coefficient in
front of FORMULA  as FORMULA . For this potential,
under the following condition
FORMULA 
the VEV's of FORMULA  and FORMULA  are aligned and at the same time the
Higgs doublet has a negative mass
FORMULA 

Order one quartic Higgs coupling
To obtain the electroweak symmetry breaking scale at 246 GeV, we
need to introduce an order one quartic Higgs coupling, which is
difficult without generating a large Higgs mass term. This problem
is present not only in a realistic super little Higgs model but
also in the simplest little Higgs model. In our model, we use the
“sliding singlet mechanism" {{cite:aa7044f4-1ad0-44c3-98eb-8305c13eb728}} to reach this goal by
including the following renormalizable superpotential:
FORMULA 
By assigning appropriate charges to FORMULA  and
FORMULA , this superpotential also preserves the global FORMULA  symmetry. The FORMULA -term potential of the FORMULA 's is
FORMULA 
Minimizing this potential, one can see that the VEV's of FORMULA 
cancel the VEV's of FORMULA . After substituting the parametrization
of FORMULA  in Eq. (REF ), we have a potential of
the Higgs doublet without any VEV's. Hence, the quartic coupling
of the Higgs doublet is of order one, and with a negative mass
from Eq. (REF ) the Higgs doublet develops a VEV at
FORMULA .

Complete triplet potential
Up to now, we have first studied the spontaneously breaking of
FORMULA  to FORMULA , and then studied
the Higgs doublet potential to break the electroweak symmetry. On
the other hand, we can also study the full FORMULA 
invariant potential of the two light triplets FORMULA , minimize
their potential and derive the final VEV structure. Combining
Eqs. (REF ), (REF ), (REF )
and choosing FORMULA  (the reason to choose a smaller FORMULA 
than the Yukawa couplings in Eq. (REF ) is the same as
FORMULA ), we have the following complete potential
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  and FORMULA  determined by the
Yukawa couplings in Eq. (REF ). The crucial “–" signs in
the first two terms and the “+" sign before the fourth term are
also derived from Eq. (REF ). Here, we neglect the
contributions to the effective potential from the gauge
interaction, due to the smallness of the gauge coupling compared
to the Yukawa couplings. For simplicity, we neglect the quartic
operator FORMULA  generated at one loop, which does not
change our final result significantly.
Minimizing this potential, we derive
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
Appoximately we have
FORMULA 
Eqs. (REF ), (REF ) show a relation
between the Higgs doublet mass and its VEV as FORMULA .
Using FORMULA  GeV, the Higgs boson mass is around 150 GeV.
Actually the ratio of the Higgs boson mass over FORMULA  depends on
order one Yukawa couplings in our model. Thus, the Higgs boson
mass can vary from 100 GeV to 200 GeV by choosing FORMULA  from FORMULA 
to FORMULA .
After electroweak symmetry breaking, the lightest quark in the top
sector, which is identified as the top quark in the standard
model, has top Yukawa coupling
FORMULA 
Choosing the
same numerical values FORMULA  as in
Fig. REF , FORMULA .

Direct gauge mediation
In our model, the soft masses of gauginos and sfermions arise from
gauge mediation. The messenger fields are embedded inside the SUSY
breaking sector, and therefore our model belongs to a direct gauge
mediation model.
The couplings in the superpotential in Eq. (REF )
explicitly break the continuous FORMULA  symmetry to FORMULA  parity.
We calculate the one-loop Coleman-Weinberg potential of the pseudo-moduli FORMULA , and find that they develop nonzero VEV's as FORMULA  (similar results can be found
in {{cite:7e27f42d-142e-4c49-9654-8aa7eac4eac8}}). In our model, it is crucial to
have non-zero VEV's of FORMULA  to generate masses for
FORMULA  and FORMULA  gauginos, which include winos and bino. But
the masses of gluinos can be generated independent of FORMULA .
For the gluino masses, FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA , are the
“messengers" in our model. We only need to consider the last four
operators in Eq. (REF )
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .
The SUSY breaking mass terms of the messenger fields are given as FORMULA . From the standard one-loop Feynman diagram calculation, we have the formula for the
masses of gluinos as
FORMULA 
where the factor of 2 comes from the presence of two ISS sectors
and the function FORMULA  is defined as
FORMULA 
Here, FORMULA  are fermion masses and FORMULA  are
scalar masses. Corresponding expressions are
FORMULA 
with
FORMULA 
Three interesting limits for Eq. (REF ) can be studied:

When FORMULA  or FORMULA , we have FORMULA  and FORMULA . As FORMULA ,
the gluinos mass is zero. For a small FORMULA , expanding the gaugino mass in
terms of FORMULA , we find that the leading non-vanishing term
is proportional to FORMULA  which agrees with {{cite:a1e0bbbd-5121-4e39-aec2-3ad1662a7b8d}}. In terms of the fermion masses, the leading term
of gluino masses is
FORMULA 

When FORMULA , this is the simpliest case of gauge
mediation models with only one messenger. In this case,
FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and FORMULA . After
algebraic manipulations, the masses of the gluino are FORMULA ,
with FORMULA .
This agrees with the result in the literature {{cite:80ded5f5-fe93-49b7-bedf-a467bde42457}}.

When FORMULA , the continuous FORMULA  symmetry is
unbroken. We have FORMULA , FORMULA  and
FORMULA . Considering that FORMULA , we have FORMULA .

In our model, all the Yukawa couplings are generally order one numbers, so FORMULA  and FORMULA  are at the same scale. With FORMULA  and FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
For the FORMULA  gauginos, the mixed messengers are FORMULA . Considering the non-zero VEV
FORMULA  and applying the same formula in
Eq. (REF ) by substituting FORMULA , FORMULA  and
FORMULA , we have the masses of those FORMULA 
gauginos to be also of FORMULA . Similar results
are derived for the FORMULA  gaugino with two sets of mixed
messengers: one is FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA ; the other
one is FORMULA . The winos and bino
are parts of FORMULA  gauginos, and hence have
masses of FORMULA .
Finally, the masses of squarks and sleptons are generated through
the traditional two-loop diagrams and are also of FORMULA .

Mass Spectrum and Phenomenology
SUSY and the global FORMULA  symmetry are broken at order FORMULA . Most fields in the ISS sectors have masses at this scale.
Especially, the Higgsino mass is
FORMULA 
This arises naturally in our model and will not cause any
fine-tuning problem for the Higgs boson mass due to the little
Higgs mechanism present in the effective low energy theory. In
addition, we have heavy colored superfields FORMULA , which are responsible for FORMULA 
breaking to FORMULA .
At the FORMULA  breaking scale FORMULA , there are the
pesudo-moduli FORMULA  and their fermionic partners containing
electroweak triplets and doublets, and massive vector superfields
FORMULA 's and FORMULA  corresponding to FORMULA  . Colored superfields FORMULA 
also have masses of this scale.
The gauginos and sfermions in the minimal supersymmetric standard
model obtain masses from direct gauge mediation as described in
the previous section and are of order a few hundered FORMULA .
Finally we comment on the masses of the standard model singlets in
our model. Most singlets in the ISS sectors, FORMULA  and FORMULA  have
masses at or above 1 TeV. The singlet PNGB in the coset space
FORMULA  obtains a mass of FORMULA 
from the operator FORMULA  added to
achieve the vacuum alignment.
In summary, we list a sample of the mass spectrum of the particles
charged under the standard model gauge group in
Table REF .
TABLE 
The scales in Table REF  are only an order-of-magnitude estimate.
The detailed spectrum depends on order one parameters in the model, and is subject
to constraints from electroweak precision measurements. To estimate the constraints,
we compare our model with the simplest little Higgs model. Previous analyses on the simplest little Higgs model {{cite:04a15562-54b6-4e34-9c64-c04f5464371f}} yield lower bounds for the masses of FORMULA 's, and then a lower bound for FORMULA  about FORMULA  TeV, depending on different choices of fermion charge assignments. Here, FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the magnitudes of the two FORMULA  breaking VEV's (we have assumed FORMULA  for the sake of simplicity throughout the paper, but this is not essential for our model). As discussed below Eq. (REF ), the Higgs mass remains variable when the scale of FORMULA  is fixed. Therefore, we can achieve FORMULA  TeV without introducing significant fine tuning. At and below the TeV scale,
in addition to particles present in the simplest little
Higgs model, there are extra scalars and superparticles from the SUSY breaking sector.
The TeV scale scalars contribute to electroweak observables only at loop levels unless the FORMULA  triplets develop VEV's to break the custodial symmmetry {{cite:bd8e6fbd-91a9-4799-8307-8e13006dee21}}, which is not the case in our model. The superparticles contribute to the electroweak observables only at loop levels. The full analyses of their effects again depend on order one parameters and are beyond the interests of this paper.
A lot of particles in our model are at or below the TeV scale and thus can be produced at the upcoming LHC. The spectrum bears a resemblance of the super-little Higgs models, namely, there exist heavy gauge bosons and fermions predicted by the little Higgs mechanism, and superpartners of the SM fields predicted by SUSY. Indeed, our model can be viewd as a UV completion of the super-simplest little Higgs model. However, there are also important differences between our model and previous super-little Higgs models. First, as discussed above, the Higgsino is necessarily absent from TeV scale spectrum. Second, our model predicts extra scalars from the SUSY breaking sector.

Conclusions
The SUSY breaking sector is usually treated as a “hidden" sector
and its effect is only mediated to the standard model through
messenger fields. In this paper, we have explored another approach
which is to identify the meta-stable SUSY breaking sector as an
extended Higgs sector. In our model, the standard model Higgs
doublet emerges from the meta-stable SUSY breaking sector as a
PNGB, and the electroweak scale is naturally two-loop factor below
the SUSY breaking scale.
We have employed two identical meta-stable SUSY breaking sectors
with FORMULA  global symmetry. At order 10 TeV, SUSY is broken and
the global symmetry is broken to FORMULA . Most fields in the SUSY
breaking sectors have tree-level masses of order 10 TeV. Among
those massless Nambu-Goldstone boson fields, there are two
triplets FORMULA  and FORMULA , in which the standard model Higgs boson
sits.
The electroweak gauge group, FORMULA , is extended
to a FORMULA  gauge group embedded in the unbroken
global symmetry. The gauge interaction explicitly breaks the
global FORMULA  symmetry and makes the triplets FORMULA  and FORMULA 
PNGB's. Introducing additional vector-like quarks in the top
sector, we have studied the one-loop effective potential of FORMULA 
and FORMULA  and found that FORMULA  and FORMULA  obtain negative masses.
With order one quartic potential, FORMULA  spontaneously breaks to
FORMULA  at the scale of 1 TeV. At the same time the gauge
symmetry FORMULA  is broken to FORMULA  and a light doublet PNGB is identified as the Higgs
doublet. At order 1 TeV, aside from the massive vector superfields
FORMULA 's and FORMULA  and additional colored superfields, there
are pseudo-moduli fields including electroweak triplets and
doublets from the dynamical SUSY breaking sectors. The soft masses
of gauginos and sfermions in the minimal supersymmetric standard model arise at one loop and two loops, respectively, in a similar way as in gauge mediation, and are of order a few hundred GeV. It is interesting that the Higgs sector plays the role of a messenger field, which distinguishes our approach from traditional gauge mediation models.
The Higgs doublet, which is a PNGB inside FORMULA  and FORMULA , has a
negative mass with another loop factor below the triplet masses
and triggers the electroweak symmetry breaking. With order one
quartic potential generated through the sliding singlet mechanism,
the correct Higgs doublet VEV can be obtained and the Higgs boson
mass can vary from 100 GeV to 200 GeV depending on order one
Yukawa couplings in our model.
