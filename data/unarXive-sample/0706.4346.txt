ABSTRACT

We study possible anomalous FORMULA -violating Higgs couplings to
FORMULA  and FORMULA  fully model-independent way
through top-quark pair productions at muon colliders. Assuming
additional non-standard neutral Higgs bosons, whose couplings
with top-quark and muon are expressed in the most general
covariant form, we carry out analyses of effects which they
are expected to produce via FORMULA -violating asymmetries and also
the optimal-observable (OO) procedure under longitudinal and
transverse muon polarizations. We find the measurement of the
asymmetry for longitudinal beam polarization could be useful to
catch some signal of FORMULA  violation, and an OO analysis might
also be useful if we could reduce the number of unknown parameters
with a help of other experiments and if the size of the parameters
is at least FORMULA .

1.FORMULA Introduction

It is widely known that the standard model of the electroweak
interaction (SM) has been so far quite successful in describing
various phenomena below the electroweak scale with high precision.
Its top-quark and Higgs-boson sectors are however still not
fully-tested part of the model. If there exists any new physics
beyond the SM within our reach, its effects will be likely to
appear in those sectors. Therefore it is worth to look for
experiments which allow for a comprehensive investigation of
top-quark and Higgs-boson properties.
Anomalous top-quark interactions could be tested, for instance,
at the FORMULA  colliders in the International Linear Collider
(ILC) project {{cite:7a943773-adf2-4ac2-afc7-2f63401ac11e}}. However it is not easy to study Higgs
sector thereby. Muon colliders were proposed as an ideal machine
to explore Higgs properties {{cite:0599c6ff-c037-4f39-b1a8-2c84d917a919}}. From a purely theoretical
point of view, muon colliders are quite similar to FORMULA 
colliders, but the fact that a muon is much heavier than an
electron could provide with a non-negligible difference in
phenomenological studies of Higgs sector.
Indeed many authors have studied how to analyze Higgs-top
interactions at muon colliders. Most of them focused
on the resonance region, i.e., direct Higgs productions, and/or
FORMULA  in the framework of some
specific models with multi Higgs doublets, like MSSM,
and pointed out that a muon collider will be a useful tool to
identify FORMULA  properties of Higgs scalars {{cite:0599c6ff-c037-4f39-b1a8-2c84d917a919}}–{{cite:b4d96845-c927-4d3d-8794-6bdf82b93850}}.
As a complementary work to them, we study in this article possible
anomalous Higgs interactions with FORMULA  and FORMULA  in a
fully model-independent way through FORMULA 
processes. Our main purpose is to clarify to what extent we would
be able to draw a general conclusion on those interactions without
assuming any particular models at muon colliders in off-resonance
region. In other words, we aim to study the possibility and limit
of muon colliders for model-independent analyses of possible new
physics in the top-quark and Higgs-boson sectors.
After describing our calculational framework in section 2, we compute
FORMULA -violating asymmetries for both longitudinal and transverse beam
polarizations in section 3, where based on the results we also discuss
a detectability of the anomalous-coupling parameters. In section 4,
we study whether the optimal-observable procedure is effective when
we try to determine the anomalous parameters separately. Finally, a
summary is given in section 5.


2.FORMULA Framework

As mentioned in Introduction, we perform a model-independent analysis
of possible non-standard Higgs interactions with top-quark/muon for
longitudinal and transverse beam polarizations. Let us summarize our
framework first which is the basis of our calculations. Throughout
this paper, we express the standard-model Higgs as FORMULA  and the
non-standard neutral Higgs as FORMULA .
Effective amplitude
The invariant amplitude of FORMULA 
corresponding to Figure REF  is given as follows:
FIGURE 
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  are the standard FORMULA  and FORMULA  exchange terms
FORMULA 
with
FORMULA 
FORMULA  being the propagators multiplied by the coupling constants
FORMULA 
FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  being the elementary charge, the FORMULA  gauge
coupling, the Weinberg angle respectively, and
FORMULA ,
FORMULA  is the standard Higgs-boson exchange term
FORMULA 
while FORMULA  is the non-standard Higgs exchange contribution, for
which we assume the most general covariant form:
FORMULA 
with
FORMULA 
(FORMULA ), FORMULA  and FORMULA  being the total decay width and
the vacuum expectation value of the SM Higgs field. We treat
FORMULA  and FORMULA  as complex numbers to take into account
the possibility that they are form factors.
Readers may claim that we assume only one additional Higgs-boson in spite
of our statement that we perform a fully model-independent analysis.
In fact, our frame can incorporate any number of Higgs exchange terms.
It will be clear by re-expressing such an amplitude as
FORMULA 
Thus, all the contributions can be packed into our parameters as
follows:
FORMULA 
Beam polarization
The beam polarization, FORMULA , along one axis (polarization axis) whose direction
is defined by a unit vector FORMULA  is given by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the number density of the particle
in each beam whose spin component on this axis is FORMULA .
We can take into account this polarization by multiplying
the spin vector FORMULA  in the projection operator
FORMULA  and FORMULA 
by FORMULA . That is,
we are to use FORMULA  as the spin vector in its rest frame.
In the following, we choose the direction of FORMULA  as the FORMULA  axis
and express the azimuthal angle of FORMULA  as FORMULA . Then the degree of
the longitudinal polarization is given by FORMULA , that of the
transverse polarization by FORMULA , and consequently
FORMULA 
The FORMULA  and FORMULA  spin vectors in the FORMULA  CM frame are
obtained from (REF ) via appropriate Lorentz transformations as
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
and the momenta of FORMULA  and FORMULA  in this frame are
FORMULA 


3. FORMULAFORMULA -violating asymmetries

It is straightforward to calculate the cross section
FORMULA  starting from amplitude
(REF ) as
FORMULA 
We perform this via FORM {{cite:01257757-f098-4a8f-bf89-0ea85d5042e5}}, but the analytical result is a
bit too long to give here explicitly. Therefore we show in the following
our results numerically. Throughout our analysis in this article,
we take FORMULA  or FORMULA . It may seem to be an extreme and
unrealistic assumption, but we chose the polarization this way
because our aim here is to know “to what extent" we could know
about the anomalous interaction (REF ), i.e., we would
like to study the possibility and limit of muon colliders for
model-independent analyses of new physics beyond the standard
model.
Numerical results
We study two FORMULA -violating asymmetries FORMULA  and FORMULA , the
former of which is the one for longitudinal beam polarization
FORMULA 
and the latter is the one for transverse polarization
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  express the cross sections for
FORMULA , while FORMULA  are
the ones for FORMULA  with FORMULA . We here chose FORMULA  to be FORMULA  since it maximizes
the FORMULA -violation effects (see, e.g., {{cite:b4d96845-c927-4d3d-8794-6bdf82b93850}}).
Concerning the decay widths of FORMULA  and FORMULA , FORMULA , they
are of course different quantities, but we use the same formula for
FORMULA  as FORMULA  within the standard model
{{cite:ae3a7902-2a40-452a-822a-b32dec310329}} (see the later discussions). The other SM
parameters are taken as follows:
FORMULA 

FORMULA 
In Figures REF  and REF  are presented FORMULA  as functions of
FORMULA  and FORMULA , while in Figures REF  and REF  are given
FORMULA  in the same way for FORMULA  as an example to sketch a
rough feature of these quantities. We find that the absolute value of
FORMULA  could be sizable, but that of FORMULA  is very small.
FIGURE 
FIGURE 
It may seem strange that there appears such big difference between
FORMULA  and FORMULA  though they are both FORMULA -violating asymmetries computed
with the same anomalous parameters. The reason is in their denominators.
In the case of FORMULA , not only the numerator FORMULA  but
also the denominator receives little contribution from FORMULA  exchange
terms, while they can contribute to FORMULA  without being
suppressed except in the difference FORMULA .
Indeed if we focus on the numerators alone, there is only small difference
between FORMULA  and FORMULA . For FORMULA  GeV and FORMULA  GeV with the same
anomalous couplings as in the figures, e.g.,
FORMULA 
It is obvious that the peaks in FORMULA  are all due to the FORMULA  propagator,
but readers might wonder why FORMULA  changes its sign while FORMULA  not in the
vicinity of FORMULA . Therefore, it would also be helpful to give a brief
explanation here about those different behaviors of them. As mentioned above,
FORMULA  receive sizable contributions from FORMULA 
exchange terms. This means the interference between the FORMULA -exchange
and FORMULA -exchange terms, which is proportional the FORMULA  propagator, is
important in FORMULA , and its sign changes thereby depending on whether
FORMULA  or FORMULA . On the other hand, this is no longer the case
for FORMULA  since the FORMULA -exchange terms are suppressed in both
FORMULA  and FORMULA . Therefore the sign of FORMULA  is determined by
the difference of FORMULA , where the size of the amplitude
FORMULA  itself is much more crucial. Here we chose FORMULA  as
an illustration, which makes FORMULA  larger than FORMULA  and leads to
positive FORMULA  as will be understood from eq.(REF ) on FORMULA 
and a similar calculation for FORMULA . This also tells us that
different parameters, e.g., FORMULA  could make FORMULA  negative.
Detectability of the asymmetry
Let us study the detectability of FORMULA , that is, the expected
statistical precision in its measurement, which tells us how precisely
we would be able to determine FORMULA . For instance if we take
FORMULA 500 GeV with FORMULA , FORMULA 
becomes 0.73, while the cross sections are
FORMULA  fb and FORMULA  fb,
leading to FORMULA  events for an integrated luminosity
FORMULA  500 fbFORMULA , where we expressed the detection efficiency of FORMULA 
productions as FORMULA . They are combined to give the following statistical
uncertainty:
FORMULA 
Consequently, the expected statistical significance FORMULA  is
FORMULA 
That is, we can confirm FORMULA  at FORMULA  level.
For example, FORMULA  for FORMULA . Here, assuming
FORMULA  500 fbFORMULA  may be a bit too optimistic, but we used this value
considering that we aim to find the possibility and limit of the muon
colliders as mentioned in the beginning of this section. It is easy to
transform our numerical results for any other FORMULA .
We have given an example of FORMULA  for FORMULA 500 GeV, but
it is not general, so let us show the results for some other
FORMULA  in Table REF , changing also the parameters as FORMULA .
There we find that we would be able to observe some signal of FORMULA  violation
as long as we are not too far from the FORMULA  pole.

TABLE 
We used the SM formula for FORMULA  as an appropriate
approximation (FORMULA 67.5 GeV for FORMULA 500 GeV {{cite:ae3a7902-2a40-452a-822a-b32dec310329}}), since we
did not introduce any new light particles that can appear in the final
state of FORMULA  and FORMULA  decays. Strictly speaking, however, a new mode like
FORMULA  might be possible for FORMULA  150 GeV and FORMULA  500 GeV.
Instead of re-computing FORMULA  including such new modes, which
demands us to assume a concrete form of those couplings, we give FORMULA 
for FORMULA  80 and 100 GeV with FORMULA  in Table REF , which tells us that
our conclusion would not be affected so much, especially in the off-resonance region.

TABLE 
Parameter dependence of the asymmetry
Measuring FORMULA  would be quite interesting, but what FORMULA  receives is
of course one single combination of contributions from all the anomalous
parameters. We are performing a model-independent analysis of possible
new-physics effects, but once we get actual experimental data, our results
are going to be applied for a realistic model building. If FORMULA  does not
depend on some parameters so much, it will be hard to test any models in
which those parameters play a significant role. Therefore it must be
important to see how FORMULA  depends on each parameter.
TABLE 
Let us study how FORMULA  changes when we vary one parameter
from 0.0 to 0.3. The results are given in Tables REF  and REF ,
where FORMULA  are presented for one of the parameters = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2 and
0.3 with the others being fixed to be 0.2. There we observe that FORMULA 
receives a contribution from every parameter though there are some differences
among them, which indicates that any model will be testable through measuring
FORMULA .

4.FORMULA Optimal-observable analysis

The optimal-observable technique {{cite:ad7066a7-659f-47db-8ecd-40cd475e84b3}} is a useful tool
for estimating expected statistical uncertainties in various
coupling measurements. Suppose we have a cross section
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  are known functions of the final-state
variables FORMULA  and FORMULA 's are model-dependent coefficients.
The goal is to determine the FORMULA 's. This can be done by using
appropriate weighting functions FORMULA  such that FORMULA . In general different choices for
FORMULA  are possible, but there is a unique choice for which the
resultant statistical error is minimized. Such functions are given by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the inverse matrix of FORMULA  which
is defined as
FORMULA 
When we use these weighting functions, the statistical uncertainty
of FORMULA  is obtained as
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  is the total
number of events.
We study whether we could get more information of the anomalous parameters
via this procedure. Here we focus on the longitudinal beam polarization,
since we found that it is practically impossible to catch any new-physics
signal for the transverse beam polarization even when we could fully use
the total cross sections.
In oder to apply this technique to our analysis, we need to express
the angular distribution of the produced top quark in terms of the
anomalous-coupling parameters like eq.(REF ). We have
altogether eight independent
parameters since we assumed the all couplings FORMULA  and FORMULA 
to be complex. Although our aim is to perform an analysis as
model-independently as possible, it will be too complicated to treat
them all equally. Therefore we here assume that the size of the imaginary
part of each parameter is much smaller than that of its real part. Since
the imaginary part of parameters (form factors) is often produced
through higher order loop corrections in an underlying theory, this
assumption is not unreasonable. We also drop the terms quartic in
the anomalous parameters.
With this reduced parameter set and assumption, the top-quark angular
distribution should be represented as
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  expresses the SM contribution,
FORMULA 
and FORMULA  are all independent of each other.
If we reverse the signs of FORMULA  and FORMULA , we get
FORMULA .
Practically, however, FORMULA  and FORMULA  become
equivalent in the limit of FORMULA . We can see this as follows:
In calculating FORMULA , the muon-spinor part
becomes
FORMULA 
in the limit. That is, FORMULA  and FORMULA  contribute almost equally
to FORMULA , which leads to
FORMULA 
Since we keep FORMULA  finite, it is in principle possible to perform
an analysis treating all FORMULA  as independent functions, but
it is clear that we end up having very poor precision thereby
{{cite:7f663977-d8a4-4617-8ba9-4177a3c1b2ca}}.
Therefore we neglect their differences from the beginning and start from
FORMULA 
where FORMULA , FORMULA ,
FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Using these functions we obtain the following results as the matrix
(REF ) for FORMULA  GeV and FORMULA  GeV:
FORMULA 
where we used FORMULA  for FORMULA  in eq.(REF ).
We then compute the FORMULA  and FORMULA  elements of the inverse matrix of
FORMULA :
FORMULA 
This means the expected statistical uncertainty in FORMULA 
measurements are
FORMULA 
This tells us that we need FORMULA  fbFORMULA  for achieving
FORMULA  and FORMULA  fbFORMULA  for FORMULA ,
which are both far beyond our reach!
We then assume one of the parameters is determined in some other
experiments in order to look for realistic solutions. First, if FORMULA 
was unknown (i.e., if FORMULA  was measured elsewhere), the corresponding
precision becomes FORMULA , i.e., FORMULA 
for FORMULA  fbFORMULA . We give also results for some other FORMULA 
in Table REF . Conversely, if FORMULA  is undetermined (i.e.,
only FORMULA  is known), we have
FORMULA , i.e., FORMULA  for FORMULA  fbFORMULA .
Some other results are in Table REF .
TABLE 

TABLE 
Therefore, if the size of FORMULA  is FORMULA , there is some hope to
catch new-physics signal thereby. On the other hand, FORMULA 
is required to be at least FORMULA . Note that it is never unrealistic
to assume FORMULA  to be FORMULA  as is known in various
models with two (or multi) Higgs-doublets (see, e.g., {{cite:d3537820-ef16-406c-a247-b69f0fafe1d7}}
and the references therein).
What we could know via FORMULA  measurements is only on FORMULA  violation,
while FORMULA  are both combinations of FORMULA -conserving and
FORMULA -violating parameters. Therefore those two approaches could work
complementarily to each other.


5.FORMULA Summary

We have carried out a model-independent analysis of possible
non-standard Higgs interactions with FORMULA  and FORMULA 
through top-quark pair productions at future muon colliders. As
was pointed out in Refs.{{cite:0599c6ff-c037-4f39-b1a8-2c84d917a919}}–{{cite:b4d96845-c927-4d3d-8794-6bdf82b93850}}, the muon colliders are
quite useful for studying the Higgs sector around the resonance.
Considering those preceding studies, our main purpose here was to
see if we could also draw any useful information in the off-resonance
region without depending on any specific models.
Starting from
the most general covariant amplitude, we computed two FORMULA -violating
asymmetries for longitudinal and transverse beam polarizations in
order to see if we could get any signal of new-physics which breaks
FORMULA  symmetry, and also studied whether we could determine the
non-standard-coupling parameters separately through the
optimal-observable (OO) procedure as a more detailed analysis.
We found that the longitudinal FORMULA -violating asymmetry FORMULA  would be
sizable, while the transverse asymmetry FORMULA  is too small to be a
meaningful observable. We then estimated the detectability of FORMULA 
and showed that we would be able to observe some signal of FORMULA  violation
as long as we are not too far from the FORMULA  pole. We also studied there
in some detail how FORMULA  depends on each parameter, and found that we
have no parameter that contribute little, although there are some
differences among the parameters.
On the other hand, more detailed
analyses via the OO procedure seem challenging. However, if we could
reduce the number of unknown parameters with a help of other experiments,
and if the size of the parameters is at least FORMULA , we
might be able to get some meaningful information thereby. Readers may
claim that the use of the asymmetry FORMULA  is enough when we have only
one unknown parameter, but this is not necessarily true. What we could
draw from FORMULA  is information on pure FORMULA  violation, while we could
also know something about FORMULA -conserving part through an OO analysis.
In our approach, we need the total cross section of FORMULA  and the angular distribution of the final top quark, for
which we only have to reconstruct the top-quark jet axis. If we further
try to study, e.g., the final lepton distributions in the
top-quark decays, we could get additional information on possible
anomalous FORMULA  coupling, however in that case we would suffer from
another suppression factor, i.e., the branching ratio of the top-quark
semileptonic decay. Therefore it will be more advantageous to use
the top-quark distribution as a whole when performing off-resonance
analyses at muon colliders.
