We present a detailed study of the adsorption of CO on Cu, Rh, and Pt (111) surfaces in top and
hollow sites. The study
has been performed using the local density approximation, the gradient corrected functional PBE, and the
hybrid
Hartree-Fock density functionals PBE0 and HSE03 within
the framework of generalized Kohn-Sham density functional theory using a plane-wave basis set.
As expected, the LDA and GGA functionals show a tendency to favor the hollow sites,
at variance with experimental findings that give the top site as the most stable adsorption site.
The PBE0 and HSE03 functionals reduce this tendency. In fact, they predict
the correct adsorption site for Cu and Rh but fail for Pt.
But even in this case, the hybrid functional destabilizes
the hollow site by 50 meV compared to the PBE functional.
The results of the total energy calculations are presented
along with an analysis of the projected density of states.

Introduction
The adsorption of carbon monoxide on metal surfaces is an important
case study in surface
science
for two reasons. On one hand, the interaction of CO with
metal surfaces plays a major role in understanding phenomena related to
e.g. catalysis, adhesion and coating as well as in many industrial
processes, such as automotive catalysis, corrosion, tribology, and
gas sensing.{{cite:984556a2-1045-4867-a33d-2b92db53db93}} Catalysts containing transition metals, such as
rhodium, palladium and platinum have been widely used to lower the
emissions of CO in automobile exhausts.{{cite:984556a2-1045-4867-a33d-2b92db53db93}} For all
the mentioned applications, it is clear that understanding
adsorption on both bare and adsorbate-covered surfaces is an important
issue.
On the other hand, the failure of Density Functional Theory (DFT)
based on local and semilocal density functionals in predicting the
correct adsorption site for CO on metal surfaces is well known. The
most notable example in literature is the CO/Pt(111) system, often referred to
as CO adsorption puzzle. No "stone was left
unturned"{{cite:c61cb0a1-7ccb-4f93-aa8c-5607ec4e56a4}}
in order to determine
the reason for the discrepancy between theory and experiment, but neither defect structures
and contaminations, nor
relativistic or spin effects, nor zero-point energies can account for the difference:
there is strong
evidence that current approximations to DFT underestimate the CO
preference for low-coordination sites.{{cite:48562f15-d024-4f89-9c9d-c8213c191645}}, {{cite:c61cb0a1-7ccb-4f93-aa8c-5607ec4e56a4}} Most
plane wave codes
predict that the hollow site is preferred
for CO on Cu, Rh and Pt (with the exception of Ref. dacapo for CO on Rh),
whereas experimentally it is found that CO adsorbs
at the top site with the carbon end down at low coverage on all three
substrates.{{cite:baf7ec87-ee02-4cc1-b242-a6d8c5c0083d}}, {{cite:e47cf0ae-1b63-4f0e-bfbe-77c7307496c3}}, {{cite:65a61850-e2d9-412d-a114-ba560fe46b81}}, {{cite:0a9187db-1a9c-4a29-b0a0-c62580e46543}} In all fairness,
it must be emphasized that some local basis set
codes (specifically DMOL and ADF) seem to give the proper site order for
Pt.{{cite:923d76d3-0ede-4704-8b5e-6b62bdd35cc5}}, {{cite:ff5ddee0-239a-4ef1-968d-de8c6e0237a2}}
The reason for the discrepancy between local basis set codes and plane
wave codes is not yet entirely understood, but it is likely to be related
to the different treatment of relativistic effects or basis sets. For Pt, the DMOL
code for instance applies effective core potentials to take into
account relativistic effects, and the site preference
depends critically on the used effective core potential, with the most
accurate effective core potential giving the same site preference as plane wave codes.{{cite:7a91e82d-12c5-4137-b583-eee338b9b0dc}}
The Amsterdam Density Functional code (ADF) also yields the correct site order
for Pt.{{cite:ff5ddee0-239a-4ef1-968d-de8c6e0237a2}} Basis set convergence, k-point sampling as well as relativistic effects
have been carefully checked for CO on Pt, and it is at this point unclear why results differ
from those reported using plane waves.
Very recently, Q.-M. Hu et al.{{cite:35d67f1b-7f46-476b-9435-fa6bf4468c1b}} have shown
that errors of present-day exchange-correlation (xc) functionals are
rather localized and spatially limited
to few nearest neighbors. For extended systems the correction can
be estimated by analyzing properly chosen clusters
and employing wavefunction based methods for an improved xc treatment. According to their study, this
procedure applied to CO/Cu(111) and CO/Ag(111) gives the top site as the most stable adsorption site, in agreement with
the experiments.{{cite:35d67f1b-7f46-476b-9435-fa6bf4468c1b}}
Returning to the discrepancy between theory and experiment obtained using DFT and plane waves, the
current suggestion is that the main reason for the failure is due to the
incorrect description of the relative position
of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of CO
with respect to the Fermi energy of the metal.{{cite:012e89f0-eee6-43e5-9a0d-73d69f5ed2a0}}
To overcome this problem several possibilities have been considered so far.
One is to apply an a posteriori correction, based on the singlet-triplet CO excitation
energy obtained by GGA and configuration
interaction calculations.{{cite:313a7b34-2369-4521-ae92-02e4822e237f}}
A second option is
using a DFT+U approach, where an additional U is added to the
DFT Hamiltonian to shift the CO LUMO to higher energies.
{{cite:48562f15-d024-4f89-9c9d-c8213c191645}}, {{cite:345b7718-2baf-4da6-9fd2-cc14f08f06d8}} A third self contained and less ad-hoc approach
is the use of hybrid functionals.{{cite:012e89f0-eee6-43e5-9a0d-73d69f5ed2a0}}
Hybrid functionals are a combination of exact non-local
orbital-dependent Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange and a standard local
exchange-correlation functional, and they
provide a significant improvement
over the LDA-GGA description for molecular as well as extended insulating and semiconducting solid
state systems.{{cite:33177f32-95fa-4cc6-9b06-4ae016a10f96}} For these systems, hybrid functionals are among the most accurate
functionals available as far as energetics and structural properties are
concerned.{{cite:750e992b-eeda-4ada-87d7-54150f87d661}}, {{cite:5f048845-98fe-4cb4-846f-bd2be8bcd511}}, {{cite:3fc96eeb-9598-4c51-a22f-f5053e7e41ae}}
Currently, the most popular ones are PBE0 (or PBE1PBE)
{{cite:265c5972-2bc9-4657-b827-4a39b976443c}}, {{cite:acac7512-24fa-4b55-8d53-d8d25633313b}} and B3LYP{{cite:46f10abf-fa31-452a-96f0-845f7e28541b}}, {{cite:7e9dbc3d-c14a-4cda-ac6a-496dfffc3519}}. The
former has been proposed by Perdew, Burke, Ernzerhof, Adamo and
Barone {{cite:e00a3824-6762-49d3-a8b8-b14f334167dd}}, {{cite:5942cecd-a70e-48b0-bf58-9279d93d15df}} as a ”parameter-free” functional based
on the PBE exchange-correlation functional. It has promising
performance for all important properties, being competitive with the
most reliable, empirically parametrized functionals.{{cite:acac7512-24fa-4b55-8d53-d8d25633313b}}
The latter was suggested by Becke{{cite:46f10abf-fa31-452a-96f0-845f7e28541b}} and soon developed
into the most popular and most widely used functional for quantum
chemical calculations.
This functional
reproduces the thermochemical properties of atoms and
molecules rather well.{{cite:b3d7701d-33a7-42b9-82a7-5517614dff3a}}
For periodic systems, in particular metals, however, the long-range
nature of the Fock exchange interaction and the resultant large
computational requirements present a major drawback. Recently, a new
hybrid functional, called HSE03, has been introduced by J. Heyd
et al.{{cite:2cabd22d-bc66-4040-9f1e-7bf0088e6038}} This functional addresses this problem by
separating the description of the exchange interaction into a short-
and a long-range part, where the long-range part is treated by
semilocal gradient corrected functionals. The new functional yields
a description of molecular properties comparable to the results
obtained using the PBE0 functional, and, in some cases, it even
gives a slight improvement over the latter.{{cite:2cabd22d-bc66-4040-9f1e-7bf0088e6038}}
To the best of our knowledge, very few ab initio calculations based on
hybrid functionals have been concerned
with the problem of CO
adsorption on
metal surfaces. Gil et al.{{cite:012e89f0-eee6-43e5-9a0d-73d69f5ed2a0}} reported on the CO
adsorption on the Pt(111) surface using both slabs and cluster
models with local, semilocal and hybrid functionals (B3LYP). But the
B3LYP calculations were restricted to clusters and extrapolation to
large clusters seems to indicate that convergence with respect to
the cluster size was not obtained. The B3LYP functional renders the
on top and fcc sites almost degenerate, whereas LDA and GGA show a
pronounced tendency to favour fcc adsorption. This was confirmed in
the work of Doll {{cite:56d345e8-b33b-4e73-823c-223571a95777}} on the same system,
where a careful
comparison between gradient corrected functionals and the B3LYP
functional has been reported. It was shown that the B3LYP functional
gives the top site as the preferred site. Finally, in the work of
Neef and Doll,{{cite:4b0ea7ee-05ec-403f-be7a-fec34a5aec44}} the adsorption of CO on the Cu(111) surface has
been studied using the local density approximation, the gradient
corrected functional of Perdew and Wang and the B3LYP functional. The
LDA and GGA yield the fcc site as favorable adsorption site, whereas
the B3LYP functional results in the preference of the top
site, in agreement with the experiment. The recent study for CO on Cu and Ag(111) come to similar conclusions.{{cite:35d67f1b-7f46-476b-9435-fa6bf4468c1b}}
All these hybrid functional studies applied only B3LYP and they made
use of localized basis sets, which are possibly affected by basis set superposition errors (BSSE).
The aim of the present report is to present an extensive density functional
study of the adsorption of CO
on close-packed (111) metallic surfaces using the PBE0 and HSE03 functionals, which have not been
considered yet for this specific problem. We also include, for comparison,
the local density approximation and the standard
gradient corrected PBE functional,
which is widely accepted as the best parameter-free density functional available.
We discuss in detail the application of these functionals to bulk, bare Cu, Rh and Pt surfaces and the corresponding
CO adsorption problem.
The study is pursued within the framework of the
plane-wave projector-augmented-wave (PAW) formalism. Based on the approach of Chawla and Voth{{cite:2d35ac80-dbc5-4889-aaf8-a5755c950e07}}
for the evaluation
of the exact exchange, PBE0 and HSE03 functionals have been recently implemented in the Vienna ab–initio Simulation
Package (VASP).{{cite:fb5f2a33-77d3-4160-b0a6-5c1a274aae82}}
We remark that the use of a plane-wave basis set for the evaluation
of the exact exchange energy
allows for calculations that are free of basis-set superposition errors and benefit from the computational
efficiency of fast Fourier transforms. Details of the implementation are given elsewhere.{{cite:33177f32-95fa-4cc6-9b06-4ae016a10f96}}, {{cite:9dbb5e33-dfb4-4f14-b038-fdae24ad63fb}}
We will focus on three
reference metal systems, Cu, Rh, and Pt, which are among
the best studied metallic surfaces concerning CO
adsorption.{{cite:984556a2-1045-4867-a33d-2b92db53db93}} We note that the adsorption of CO on Rh(111) has not been investigated
using hybrid functionals.
The paper is organized as follows. In the next Section we describe the computational approach and the
model systems used;
in Sect.  we briefly review the calculated properties for the bulk and corresponding bare (111) surfaces as well
as for the CO molecule; in Sect.  we discuss the results concerning the structural properties
and energetics of the adsorbed CO molecule on the surface; Sect. 
is devoted to the electronic properties in terms of density of states; in
Sect.  we discuss the main results of this work and
in Sect.  we draw our conclusions.

Theoretical and computational method
The first principles density functional theory calculations have been
performed within the local and generalized gradient density approximation to
DFT in the Ceperley-Alder and Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof parametrization, respectively.{{cite:0f90da97-0184-49a7-8bc4-bd3640d98288}}, {{cite:8f84c28b-4191-427b-8f64-f8c8b30116d9}}
In the present calculations, the interaction between the ions and valence electrons is described by the projector
augmented wave (PAW){{cite:bf75f97c-a31c-4c99-aaa4-06d814745ef3}} method in the implementation of Kresse and Joubert.{{cite:531d2271-1f84-40b6-a06a-61a54d4ee4d3}}
The cutoff energy has been fixed to 400 eV, which is sufficient to give well converged
results for the systems considered in this work.{{cite:9dbb5e33-dfb4-4f14-b038-fdae24ad63fb}}
The surfaces have been modelled by a periodic four layer metal slab
with a CO molecule adsorbed on one side of the slab,
vertical to the (111) surface plane (asymmetric setup).
For CO on Pt(111), tests with a six layer metal slab using the HSE03 functional have also been performed in order to
check the convergence with respect to the slab thickness: the relative stability of the different sites
does not change. Each slab is separated from its periodic image in the FORMULA direction
by a vacuum space of FORMULA  10 Å.
The two uppermost surface layers and the CO molecule are allowed to relax (substrate
buckling up to the second layer below the surface). For the
electronic relaxation, we fix the energy threshold to 10FORMULA  eV whereas, the ionic relaxation is stopped
when all forces are smaller than 0.1 eV/Å.
We use a FORMULA  in-plane periodicity, which is equivalent to a coverage of FORMULA  ML.
With this choice,
the separation between the molecule and its in-plane periodic images is large enough
to neglect spurious adsorbate-adsorbate interactions with a reasonable computational effort.{{cite:1cb4f0a4-99f0-4c3d-8081-f28e79d8e838}}
For the HSE03 calculations, the range separation parameter FORMULA  was set to FORMULA ÅFORMULA 
in both the density
functional part as well as the non-local Fock exchange.{{cite:57e36d9b-528b-4c07-ad68-d9d185195b9a}}
The Brillouin zone integrations are performed
on symmetry reduced grids using the Monkhorst-Pack scheme.{{cite:0108be21-dc24-4ab0-a2e6-a53a2f459f7c}}
To accelerate k-point convergence,
we set the Methfessel-Paxton{{cite:395803bb-feaa-400c-917f-fc42eabfb338}} smearing
width to 0.1 eV. We have carefully checked the k-point convergence by performing
calculations using 4FORMULA 4FORMULA 1, 6FORMULA 6FORMULA 1
and 8FORMULA 8FORMULA 1 points (see discussion in Sect. ).
The numerical accuracy of the adsorption
energies is estimated
to be FORMULA  20 meV.
We have also investigated the effect of downsampling the reciprocal space representation
of the Fock exchange operator
for the HSE03 functional as outlined in Ref. Paier2. In particular, the Fock exchange
operator has been evaluated on the ”full”  FORMULA FORMULA FORMULAFORMULA 1 k-point mesh, as well as, on the
corresponding ”downsampled”  FORMULA FORMULA FORMULAFORMULA  grid, with FORMULA =4, 6, 8
(for details see Ref. Paier2). Results are discussed in Sect. . Finally,
we have also tested, for a reference case (HSE03),
the effect of the parameter that controls the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) grid for the HF routines (keyword ENCUTFOCK in the
VASP code). By considering the smallest possible FFT grid that just encloses the cutoff sphere corresponding to the
plane wave cutoff (ENCUTFOCK=0) or simply removing this constraint (without the flag ENCUTFOCK), total energies
change by less than 5 meV.{{cite:cb676460-ffff-4df5-a2d0-1fd027763025}}
We considered three adsorption sites:
top site, where CO is sitting vertically
above a metal atom in the top layer, and
the hcp (fcc) hollow site, where CO is sitting vertically above a
metal atom in the second (third) topmost layer.

Bulk, bare surface and CO molecule
Before studying the effect of CO adsorption on the (111) metal
surfaces, we first consider the bulk and bare surfaces. In
Table REF  we summarize the results for the bulk systems
reporting the lattice constant (FORMULA ) and the bulk modulus (FORMULA )
obtained using the Murnaghan equation of state.
The cohesive energy (FORMULA ) is
calculated considering unconstrained, i.e. spin polarized and nonspherical,
ground states of the atoms.{{cite:33177f32-95fa-4cc6-9b06-4ae016a10f96}} The numbers between
round brackets give the relative errors with respect to experiment.
As usual,
the LDA (GGA) lattice constants are slightly underestimated (overestimated) with respect to
the experiment. Note that the
experimental lattice constants reported in
Tab. REF  have not been extrapolated to 0 K and
the zero-point quantum fluctuations have not been included in the
DFT calculations. However, the inclusion of these contributions
should change the values by only approximately FORMULA 
0.1 %, which we can neglect for the purpose of the present
study.{{cite:97dd287f-631c-4b0d-8018-5d5397d4588d}}
Using hybrid functionals,
the lattice constant is almost unchanged for Cu
(only a slight expansion is found using PBE0 and HSE03) and
the overestimation is generally reduced in the other two cases.
For Rh, the hybrid functionals overcorrect
the lattice constant giving a theoretical value smaller than the
experimental one; for Pt, it remains slightly larger than
experiments.
Except for Cu, the agreement with experiment improves using hybrid functionals (the PBE0 and HSE03
relative errors are smaller than the PBE ones).
The overestimation (underestimation) of the lattice constants goes
in hand with an underestimation (overestimation) of the
bulk-moduli.
The PBE functional predicts
FORMULA  slightly more accurately than hybrid functionals
for the systems under study.
The cohesive energies are overestimated at the LDA level, they are very well
reproduced for the
three bulk metals at the PBE level, but they are underestimated
using
hybrid functionals. The underbinding has been attributed
to the admixture of Fock exchange, and
to the fact that Hartree-Fock usually underbinds, especially for metals.{{cite:56d345e8-b33b-4e73-823c-223571a95777}}, {{cite:ebb572e2-4697-4100-84c0-4741a4bf15ae}}
We believe that this is not generally true for hybrid functionals. In fact,
as shown in Ref. Paier2,
the atomization energies for systems without FORMULA  electrons, like Li, Na and Al are quite comparable for
the PBE, PBE0 and HSE03
functionals (and very close to experimental results within 0.05-0.15 eV). Most probably,
the reason for the reduction of the
atomization energies of FORMULA  metals is related to the increased stability of the
spin polarized atom compared with an artificial
non-spin-polarized atom. The hybrid functional overestimates the exchange splitting
in FORMULA  elements, with a consequent increase of
the spin-polarization energy. This however does not explain the discrepancy for Cu.
Here we believe that the
neglect of dynamical correlation effects between closed FORMULA  shells is a major source of errors accounting for
roughly 210 meV of the discrepancy.{{cite:829bf58a-b0e1-4eb8-a460-0e1000f0bd3c}} Proper inclusion of these Van der Waals-like forces
would also decrease the theoretical lattice constant of Cu.
For Cu and Pt, we can compare our hybrid functional results with Ref. Doll and
Ref. Neef,
respectively. From Tab. REF , it is evident
that our results are significantly closer to the experiment
than those of Ref. Doll and Ref. Neef at the bulk level.
This is most likely related to the B3LYP
functional being specifically designed for small molecules,
limiting or reducing its precision for heavy elements.{{cite:6de6a1d5-28bd-4c85-b411-6db46367ab8a}}
In Tab. REF  we show the relevant properties of the bare surfaces:
FORMULA  is the interlayer distance between the first and
second topmost surface layer
(and the corresponding relative variation with respect to the theoretical bulk value in round
brackets)
and the surface energies (FORMULA ).
For all functionals,
the Cu and Rh surface layer relaxes inwards.
For Pt, the top layer relaxes outward. This "anomalous" relaxation is already documented
in literature.{{cite:2f4b3f8e-0233-4f37-930c-9f3df08eb8ee}}, {{cite:118c04f4-08c5-47ad-b33f-4b27839d5df6}} The change of FORMULA  relative to the theoretical interlayer bulk
distance (FORMULA ) for Cu is FORMULA 0.9 % using PBE,
in agreement
with calculations of Neef (PW91);
the same quantity calculated using PBE0 (HSE03) is FORMULA 1.8 %
(FORMULA 0.9 %) which is again close to the one obtained using B3LYP in
the same work (FORMULA 1.2 %).
For Rh, FORMULA  is FORMULA 1.6% (PBE),
FORMULA 0.6 % (PBE0), FORMULA 1.0 % (HSE03) and for Pt it is
FORMULA 0.7 % (PBE), FORMULA 1.3 % (PBE0) and FORMULA 1.3 % (HSE03).
Our values obtained both using standard GGA and hybrid functionals
are slightly smaller than those obtained by Doll.
The comparison with experiment is not simple due to the
large uncertainties of the experimental
values: for Cu FORMULA  is
FORMULA 1.0FORMULA 0.4 %,{{cite:ab714e1a-1c10-4a1b-a6c7-f2f034965303}}
for Rh it is FORMULA 1.3FORMULA 0.9 %,{{cite:be98c531-9520-492d-a242-bdc0efc27253}} and for Pt it is FORMULA 1.1FORMULA 0.4 % .{{cite:118c04f4-08c5-47ad-b33f-4b27839d5df6}}
Agreement between our calculations and experimental results is certainly reasonable.
The calculated LDA surface energies compare well with previous calculations.{{cite:81362b33-28a5-459b-bb23-4198c0f1352a}}
The GGA surface energy is 0.45, 0.81 and 0.62
eV, for Cu, Rh and Pt,
respectively, also in agreement with the values reported in
the literature (0.50 eV, 0.81, 0.65).{{cite:b65be903-6d99-4edc-963a-42d8cc90b52b}}, {{cite:7a8cb3a3-7207-46e5-8aba-42337d51c458}}, {{cite:56d345e8-b33b-4e73-823c-223571a95777}}
The PBE0 and HSE03 functionals give a slightly increased surface energy
compared to the PBE functional. Such an increase of the surface
energies
is pointing towards an improved description using
the hybrid functionals, but they are still underestimated compared to experiments:
the experimental surface energies
are FORMULA  0.65 eV for Cu(111), FORMULA  1.08 eV for
Rh(111), FORMULA  1.08 for Pt.{{cite:71804c19-73d2-4a7a-a3a4-46930317c82e}}
The B3LYP results{{cite:4b0ea7ee-05ec-403f-be7a-fec34a5aec44}}, {{cite:56d345e8-b33b-4e73-823c-223571a95777}} do not follow a
consistent trend, with an increased surface energy for Cu and a decreased one for Pt.
We have also calculated the PBE and HSE03 work function for the three (111) metal
surfaces (not shown in Tab. REF ).
For Cu, we have 6.34 (6.10) eV; for Rh, 5.38 (5.05) eV; for Pt, 5.69 (5.64) eV using the PBE (HSE03) functional.
The experimental values are 4.98, 4.98, 5.65 eV for Cu, Rh and Pt.{{cite:0f9513e1-dac3-47ec-a2a3-a78734fe057a}}
We note that PBE values are overestimated compared to
experimental values; the HSE03 functional reduces the
overestimation and gives better agreement with experiments especially for Rh, and
Pt.
Finally for the CO molecule, the calculated bond-length
(FORMULA ) is 1.135, 1.143, 1.133, 1.131 Å for LDA, GGA (PBE), PBE0, HSE03,
close to the values reported by Neef (1.150 and 1.140 Å using PW91 and B3LYP{{cite:4b0ea7ee-05ec-403f-be7a-fec34a5aec44}}).
The experimental bond length is 1.128 Å.{{cite:71e5c196-f6f0-4ee1-82db-8455a6fba465}}
As far as the HOMO-LUMO gap is concerned we find 6.80, 6.90, 10.60, 8.80 eV
using LDA, GGA (PBE), PBE0, and HSE03 respectively. The hybrid
functionals give an energy gap increased by FORMULA  2-3 eV due to
the downshift of the HOMO and a simultaneous upshift of the LUMO.
The negative of the calculated HOMO energy is 9.0, 8.6, 10.6, 10.0 eV using LDA, GGA (PBE), PBE0 and HSE03 respectively,
compared to the experimental
ionization potential of 14.10 eV.{{cite:74fe6070-f264-4880-9af1-218450148160}}

CO adsorption: energetics and structural properties
In Table REF , REF  and REF 
we show the results for the adsorption of a CO molecule on Cu, Rh and Pt surfaces, respectively.
As expected, using the standard LDA and GGA functionals
the wrong site is preferred (shown in boldface),
namely fcc, hcp and fcc for Cu, Rh and Pt in agreement with previous
calculations.{{cite:56d345e8-b33b-4e73-823c-223571a95777}}, {{cite:a72be3f4-b9bb-413c-bb99-e3779c431ef3}}, {{cite:4b0ea7ee-05ec-403f-be7a-fec34a5aec44}}
The order of the sites with respect to the energy (starting from the most stable one)
is fcc, hcp, top for Cu; hcp, fcc, top for Rh; fcc, hcp and top for Pt.
These site orders generally agree with those reported in
Refs. Doll, Neef and Lukas, although different
surface reconstructions and computational methods were used.
It should be noted that, for the Cu case, our calculated adsorption energy for
the most stable site is lower
by more than 400 meV
compared to that given in Ref. Neef.
Also the surface energy
(bare surface) differs (see previous Section).
These discrepancies can be possibly related to the
different computational method used in Ref. Neef, where a
local basis set has been applied.
Using PBE0 or HSE03, the top site is preferred for Cu and Rh,
in agreement with experiment.
For Cu and PBE0 and HSE03, the site order is top, fcc, hcp (the same as found
in Ref. Neef using B3LYP). The calculated adsorption energy (top site) is about
FORMULA 0.60 eV.
This value is also close to that reported in Ref. Neef (FORMULA 0.57 eV).
The relative energy splitting (FORMULA ) between hcp and top is FORMULA  40 meV using PBE0 and FORMULA  30 meV
using HSE03. A larger energy splitting (150 meV) was found by Neef,{{cite:4b0ea7ee-05ec-403f-be7a-fec34a5aec44}} and an even larger one (FORMULA  200 meV)
in Ref. Scheffler using B3LYP.
Furthermore, we find an almost degeneracy between the top and fcc sites using HSE03
(FORMULA =FORMULA 6 meV).
For Rh, the site order is top, hcp and fcc using both hybrid functionals. The calculated
adsorption energy is FORMULA 2.109 and FORMULA 2.012 eV using PBE0 and HSE03. The splitting top-fcc is only
FORMULA  5 meV
using PBE0 and FORMULA  16 meV using HSE03, hence certainly within the error bars of the present calculations.
Therefore, even though the calculated adsorption energies predict the correct site order for Cu and Rh,
we can only safely conclude that the applied hybrid functionals
reduce the tendency of LDA and GGA functionals to favor the hollow site
with respect to the top sites.
Finally, for Pt, neither PBE0 nor HSE03 recover the correct site preference:
the top site remains unfavoured with respect to the fcc site,
and the top and hcp sites are almost degenerate within the numerical
accuracy. We, however, note that the top-fcc energy difference is FORMULA  350 meV (LDA), FORMULA 
160 meV (GGA), FORMULA  56 meV (PBE0) and FORMULA  70 meV (HSE03). Therefore,
the tendency to favour the hollow sites is again reduced using hybrid functionals, but not sufficiently
so for Pt.
In order to rule out possible errors due to the k-point mesh,
we performed additional calculations for the HSE03 case and CO on Pt using
a 12FORMULA 12FORMULA 1 k-point grid and downsampling the HF
exchange part to 6FORMULA 6FORMULA 1 k-points.
We found that the relative stability
of the top and fcc sites changed by only FORMULA  20 meV. Also increasing
the number of layers to 6 did not change the site order. The presented numbers are thus essentially converged.
Finally we compare the calculated adsorption energies of Cu, Rh and Pt with experimental values.
For Cu(111), the experimental values are in the range of FORMULA 0.52 to FORMULA 0.46 eV,
{{cite:71f78f96-c89c-4d94-ad99-7a7339edfd08}}, {{cite:a9c53c5d-39bf-4fda-beec-42a7ced01c3e}} close to our calculated value (FORMULA 0.60 eV).
For Rh(111), they are between FORMULA 1.65 and FORMULA 1.43 eV
{{cite:8183636d-cf73-4652-9013-21392b0a2e6c}}, {{cite:04ecf1c0-6029-4b6a-ba4e-df6965933c51}}. In this case, the theoretical values are too large by FORMULA  0.40-0.60 eV
and, worse, the hybrid functionals give a slight increase of the adsorption energy compared to the gradient
corrected functional.
This result
is certainly disappointing, and we will return to it in the conclusions.
For Pt(111), experimental values are in the range
of FORMULA 1.71 to FORMULA 1.43 eV,{{cite:ece68da5-a434-40fe-9805-1c0a1571587c}}, {{cite:9e5691f7-f9dd-4634-a866-f250a1539a9d}}, {{cite:ff24a481-aa6d-47b9-ae17-cf8a4621c4a4}} which compare
reasonably well with the PBE value. Again the hybrid
functionals clearly worsen the
agreement with experiment.
Concerning the geometry relaxations, we summarize the trend common to all the three functionals:
i) the CO bond length is slightly elongated with respect to the theoretical value for the isolated
molecule (FORMULA =1.14  Å)
in the top site, and
even more so in the hollow sites. This holds for all three metal
surfaces. ii) The elongation of FORMULA  correlates
with a corresponding contraction of FORMULA  from low coordination (top)
to high coordination sites (fcc, hcp).
iii)
The buckling FORMULA  is larger for the top site.
iv) FORMULA  varies significantly from top to hcp sites, especially for Cu,
where an inward relaxation for atop adsorption and an outward relaxation for the hollow sites
is observed, whereas an outward relaxation is found in all three sites for Rh and Pt.
We conclude this section with a brief discussion of the k-point convergence
presented in Tab.REF .
Concentrating first on the PBE functional, we note that k-point convergence
is slowest for the Cu surface, but fairly fast for the other two systems.
A relative precision of 10 meV can be attained using 6FORMULA 6FORMULA 1
k-points for all three systems [sampling specified for FORMULA  supercell].
The 4FORMULA 4FORMULA 1 k-point set results in errors between
80 meV (Cu), 30 meV (Rh)  and 10 meV (Pt).
The HSE03 functional shows a similar convergence rate, with  errors
being only slightly larger. Now 6FORMULA 6FORMULA 1 k-points are sufficient
to yield energies to within a precision of 15 meV, whereas
the 4FORMULA 4FORMULA 1 k-point grid causes errors between
120 meV (Cu) and 30 meV (Rh and Pt).
Reducing the k-point sampling for the presentation of the non-local Fock
exchange part has only a very small effect on the relative energies (10 meV), which
is more than acceptable, in particular, in view of a speed up by a factor four if
the sampling for the non-local part of the Hamiltonian
is reduced in FORMULA  and FORMULA  direction by a factor 2.
The PBE0 functional, however, converges exceedingly slowly, with discrepancies
between 6FORMULA 6FORMULA 1 and 8FORMULA 8FORMULA 1 k-points being up to 50 meV.
We were unable to increase the k-point grid beyond 8FORMULA 8FORMULA 1 points with our
available computational resources, but the relative energies using 8FORMULA 8FORMULA 1
k-points are typically within 10-20 meV of those obtained using the HSE03 functional,
and we expect them to come even closer to the HSE03 results, if the k-point set
were further improved.
This clearly demonstrates that the HSE03 functional is vastly superior
in terms of computational requirements, in particular, for metallic systems.
The calculations using the HSE03 functional and 6FORMULA 6FORMULA 1 k-points with the
Hartree-Fock part presented on a 3FORMULA 3FORMULA 1 k-point grid are typically a factor 12 faster
than the PBE0 calculations using 8FORMULA 8FORMULA 1 k-points, although both yield
practically the same results.

Electronic properties
According to the Blyholder model{{cite:106ea145-f3b3-4078-9ab5-698546e91444}}
the interaction of the CO molecule with a
transition metal surface
is usually described as the sum of two contributions. The first is
due to the overlap of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)
FORMULA  with metal states.
Since this interaction is
accompanied by donation of electrons from the FORMULA  orbital
into empty metal surface orbitals, this term is called donating
term. The second term is due to the interaction of the surface-electron
bands with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) FORMULA .
This is a back-donating term, since now electrons are transferred
from the metal surface orbitals into the FORMULA 
orbitals. This
simplistic model has been refined by A.
Föhlisch,{{cite:1a368fa8-ba6d-4d52-8ab2-5b3e4f7f8c53}}, {{cite:71f4f202-3f32-4533-8b0d-3ee620e2eda3}} using x-ray emission spectroscopy
and ab initio cluster calculations. They showed that
the FORMULA  bonding is manifested through the creation of a FORMULA  complex
related to a hybridization of 1FORMULA  and
2FORMULA  orbitals with metal states. The 4FORMULA  and 5FORMULA  orbitals and the metal states
form a hybrid FORMULA  band. The work of Föhlisch
concentrates mainly on the interaction of the frontier orbitals with metal FORMULA  states,
however, another often overlooked issue is that CO chemisorption to a
transition-metal surface also involves interactions between the
broad metal FORMULA  valence electron band (which contains approximately one electron per atom for Cu, Rh, Pt)
and the CO orbitals. Due to symmetry, the FORMULA  orbital can not interact with
the FORMULA  or FORMULA  orbitals for top site adsorption, but the FORMULA -FORMULA  interaction is
strong at high coordination sites, since antisymmetric
combinations of surface FORMULA  orbitals are available at these sites.{{cite:9beaba68-9fcc-4828-8d8b-11c3e1106c36}}
In order to gain insight on the effect of hybrid functionals on the electronic properties,
we show the orbital resolved
electronic density of states (DOS) for the Cu, Rh and Pt
surfaces in Fig. REF , Fig. REF , and Fig. REF  respectively.
For each Figure, we show the DOS for
the bare surface layer [(a), panels d, sp], for CO adsorbed
on the top [(b), panels d, sp, CO], and hollow site
[(c), panels d, sp, CO] as obtained
using PBE (left column) and HSE03 (right column). Here d, sp, CO indicate the projection onto FORMULA , FORMULA  metal states,
and CO molecular orbitals respectively. In panel (a)-d, we show the one-electron energies of the FORMULA , FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
molecular levels aligned with the Fermi level using bold tick marks.{{cite:dbcbe127-0576-445f-9b5c-1dfd1269e60e}}
Since there are no principal differences between the PBE0 and HSE03 DOS, only
results for the latter are shown. We caution the reader that the following analysis based on the atom-projected DOS
can only give qualitative insight on variations of the
chemisorption energies upon changing the adsorption sites,
the metal surface and the exchange-correlation functional.
A more powerful and quantitative analysis can be
done by using the concept of surface group orbitals introduced
by R.A. van Santen,{{cite:6827a9e4-6978-4c91-a735-4a2326d40c62}}, {{cite:0bd99c40-3984-4c76-af9d-db8857ce763d}}, {{cite:817ced97-1ff1-41f0-879a-adf4d1de1684}} but this is
beyond the purpose of this paper.
We recall the basic features of the interaction of the CO molecule with the metal
surface,{{cite:48562f15-d024-4f89-9c9d-c8213c191645}}, {{cite:8235fd57-fb5f-4bcd-9cd0-41894cdeed68}}, {{cite:b5eca503-fe09-4d2a-ae49-aba4142d3552}}, {{cite:9beaba68-9fcc-4828-8d8b-11c3e1106c36}} and we first focus on the
PBE DOS for the Cu case (Fig. REF ,
left column). From panel (a)-d and (a)-sp, we note that the
Cu FORMULA  band is almost completely filled,
it is centered around FORMULA 2.4
eV (FORMULA  band center of gravity) with FORMULA =1.52 eV
(FORMULA  band width);{{cite:49923590-64f0-4f59-b506-33effc349ed4}}
the FORMULA  band extends over a larger energy
range below the Fermi energy, but it is strongly peaked around FORMULA 5
eV;
the FORMULA  level is located at FORMULA 2.70 eV,
and the FORMULA  level is positioned at FORMULA  4.20 eV above the Fermi energy.
Let us now consider the interaction of the metal states
with the CO FORMULA  orbitals in the top configuration [Fig. REF  (b)].
The metal FORMULA  bands broaden and shift down to lower energies due to the
interaction with the CO molecule [compare panels (b)-d with (a)-d]. In particular, the
FORMULA  DOS is strongly modified.
From panel (b)-CO we see that the FORMULA  and FORMULA  orbitals are
shifted to lower energy (two main peaks at FORMULA 10 and FORMULA 7 eV with
continuous line).
Comparing panels in (b), it is clear that a
strong interaction between FORMULA  and FORMULA  metal states and the FORMULA  molecular
states takes place giving
rise to a bonding contribution
below the Fermi level (below FORMULA  6 eV) and non-bonding and
antibonding contributions partly even above the Fermi
level (dFORMULA  band).{{cite:1a368fa8-ba6d-4d52-8ab2-5b3e4f7f8c53}}, {{cite:9beaba68-9fcc-4828-8d8b-11c3e1106c36}}
We recall that, since almost fully occupied states are interacting, the
interaction would be only a Pauli-like repulsion, if the
antibonding FORMULA  hybrid states were not pushed
above the Fermi level (relief of Pauli repulsion).{{cite:b967f3a0-7bff-48c5-a731-0b72ff55696f}}
The corresponding depletion of FORMULA  states
(donation from CO to the metal) is in accordance with the Blyholder model.
Let us now consider the FORMULA  orbitals.
From panel (b)-CO, we note that they are
shifted to lower energy due to the interaction with FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and FORMULA  metal states (bonding contribution).
The FORMULA  states are found at FORMULA 7 eV (dotted line), and a small peak of FORMULA 
symmetry at the position of the FORMULA  orbital is visible and related to the FORMULA 
hybridization.{{cite:1a368fa8-ba6d-4d52-8ab2-5b3e4f7f8c53}} Above FORMULA 6 eV, a non-bonding and antibonding FORMULA derived
band develops (dFORMULA  band){{cite:1a368fa8-ba6d-4d52-8ab2-5b3e4f7f8c53}} which, however, remains below the Fermi energy
(Pauli-like repulsion). The bonding states due to the interaction between the
FORMULA  orbital and the FORMULA  band are found around FORMULA 4 eV
(again FORMULA  complex){{cite:1a368fa8-ba6d-4d52-8ab2-5b3e4f7f8c53}} and antibonding
interactions well above the Fermi energy (not shown in the Figure). The partial occupation of
the 2FORMULA  molecular orbital corresponds
to a back-donation of electrons from the substrate to the originally empty 2FORMULA  molecular
orbital, in accordance with the Blyholder model.
For the hcp site, there are some differences. The FORMULA  orbital is only
marginally affected upon adsorption, whereas the FORMULA 
(FORMULA ) and FORMULA  (FORMULA ) bands are broadened
and shifted to lower energy [compare panel (c)-d with (a)-d].
The interaction is mainly with the FORMULA  orbitals:
the peaks with
dashed and dotted lines above FORMULA 6 eV in panel (c)-CO have increased compared to
the corresponding ones in panel (b)-CO.
In accordance with the arguments of Ref. Santen4,
the interaction between the metal FORMULA  and FORMULA  states and the CO FORMULA  states
is also enhanced, as reflected by a downshift of the metal FORMULA  states. Note that
three metal atoms are affected by adsorption in the hollow site as compared to one
metal atom for the top site.
In summary, the FORMULA  and FORMULA  interaction is larger for the hcp site than for atop adsorption.
At this point, before considering the HSE03 DOS,
we stress again that CO chemisorption to a
transition-metal surface involves interaction of the molecular frontier orbitals
and the broad FORMULA  and narrow FORMULA  band.
The question whether the single-atom or high
coordination site is favoured is clearly the result of a subtle
balance between single-atom favouring interactions with the
FORMULA  molecular states and high-coordination favouring
interactions with the FORMULA  molecular states.
For CO on Cu(111) the balance between single-atom and high-coordination directing interactions
is such that the hollow site adsorption is favoured for the PBE functional.
We now turn our attention to Fig. REF  right column.
For the bare surface [(a)-d],
we see that the FORMULA  states are shifted to lower energy by FORMULA  1 eV with respect to
the Fermi level compared to the PBE DOS (FORMULA =FORMULA 3.6
eV), but
the overall spectral shape and the bandwidth remain
almost unchanged. The downward shift of
the HSE03 FORMULA  bands can be understood as a result of the
reduction of the self-interaction (SIC) within the FORMULA  shell in the
hybrid-functional formalism. It is also
clearly seen that the occupied (unoccupied) molecular levels are shifted downwards (upwards)
with respect to the Fermi energy: the FORMULA  level is now located at
FORMULA 4.30 eV and the FORMULA  level is at 4.50 eV. The
change of the energy positions of the non-interacting
molecular levels with respect to the Fermi energy is mainly related
to the increased HOMO-LUMO gap in the free molecule, but also partly caused by the reduced
work function for the HSE03 functional (6.10 eV compared to 6.30 eV for PBE).
The effect of the inclusion of part of the exact exchange on the broad FORMULA  band is different.
As a matter of fact, the FORMULA  band is restrained to be located at the Fermi level (it is partially occupied),
and the main effect of the non-local exchange is
to increase the total bandwidth by 0.70 eV [compare left and right panel (a)-sp].
The above analysis immediately leads to a
first conclusion. The down-shift of the FORMULA  band and
simultaneous up-shift of the FORMULA  levels suggest a
reduced FORMULA  interaction: according to second order
perturbation theory, the larger energy distance between the
unperturbed energy levels weakens the interaction.
Inspection of the calculated DOS confirms this conjecture for HSE03:
i) the FORMULA  peaks are much weaker,
ii) hybridization between FORMULA  and FORMULA  molecular orbitals decreases
corresponding to a
decrease of the bonding interaction between the CO FORMULA states and the metal FORMULA  states
according to Föhlisch.{{cite:1a368fa8-ba6d-4d52-8ab2-5b3e4f7f8c53}}
We now summarize our analysis concerning the differences between the PBE and HSE03 functional.
For the non-interacting fragments (bare surface and CO molecule) the HSE03 functional
i) pushes the occupied molecular levels
down in energy, whereas
the unoccupied molecular orbitals are moved up
in energy, and ii) the fully occupied FORMULA  band is shifted down in energy.
We have seen that these two combined effects generally disfavour the FORMULA 
interaction. It decreases for both the atop and the hollow site,
but the destabilization is stronger in the hollow sites,
in accordance with the observation that the FORMULA  interaction is dominant at the hollow sites.
This is confirmed by the observation that the adsorption energies in Tab. REF 
decrease for both atop and hollow sites, but the effect is twice as strong
for the hollow sites (compare the relative variation of the
adsorption energies from PBE to HSE03, in Tab. REF ).
A quantitative confirmation of this picture stems from the occupation of the
FORMULA  orbital in the hollow site. We recall that the larger the FORMULA  occupation is,
the stronger is the interaction of FORMULA  with the metal states.{{cite:9beaba68-9fcc-4828-8d8b-11c3e1106c36}}
The FORMULA occupation is
0.80 and 0.66 electrons using PBE and HSE03
respectively, hence the occupation decreases by FORMULA  17% from PBE
to HSE03.
Let us now consider the CO adsorbed on the Rh(111) surface
in Fig. REF . In the following, we mainly concentrate on the differences between
the PBE and HSE03 description (left and right panels).
For the bare surface and HSE03 [panel (a)-d], there is a general downshift
(upshift) of the occupied (unoccupied) part of the FORMULA  bands with respect to the
Fermi energy. This leads to a small downshift of the center of
gravity (FORMULA =FORMULA 1.86 and FORMULA 2.23 eV using PBE and HSE03)
and
a sizeable larger bandwidth (FORMULA =7.40 and 8.90 eV
using the PBE and HSE03 functional).
For atop adsorption [panel
(b)-d], we see a
small decrease of the intensity of the corresponding FORMULA  band
[dotted line in panel (b)-CO]. There is also a small reduction of the
FORMULA  and FORMULA  hybridization and of the FORMULA 
interaction (reduction of the intensity of the corresponding broad
bands with dashed line). As far as the FORMULA  interaction is
concerned, one can see from panel (b)-CO that the FORMULA  band is
slightly less intense at the HSE03 level (reduction of the
interaction strength). For the hcp site, we observe the same trends
as for the top site.
Let us summarize again the differences between PBE and HSE03. As
opposed to Cu, the FORMULA  band is only slightly shifted downwards, but
posses a much larger bandwidth (1.50 eV). As a result, the strength
of the FORMULA  interaction is only slightly reduced using HSE03:
the
reduction of the FORMULA  interaction caused by the up-shift of the
FORMULA  orbital is counteracted by the larger FORMULA  bandwidth of the
metal using HSE03. This is corroborated by the
FORMULA  occupation for the hollow site, which changes only from 1.05 to 1.01 electrons
( i.e. FORMULA  4 %) going from PBE to
HSE03. We recall that for Copper, the variation was about 17 %,
i.e. much larger than for Rh.
Secondly, the FORMULA  electrons are largely affected by the
introduction of the non-local exchange. For the bare surface,
HSE03 reduces the self-interaction within the FORMULA  shell
and moves them to lower energies.
This
suggest an enhancement of the back-donation due to the interaction of the 2FORMULA  states
with antisymmetric linear combinations
of metal FORMULA  orbitals, which, we recall, is active only for the hollow site.{{cite:9beaba68-9fcc-4828-8d8b-11c3e1106c36}}
For Rh, the balance between atop- and hollow-directing interactions
gives still a slight preference for atop adsorption using HSE03 (cfr. Tab. REF ).
Finally we turn our attention to Pt(111).
Basically we observe the same trends as for Rh using HSE03, a
down-shift
of the FORMULA  band center of gravity and a larger bandwidth is observed (FORMULA =FORMULA 2.13 and FORMULA 2.53 eV,
FORMULA =8.29 and 9.32 eV using PBE and HSE03, respectively).
The work-function changes only a little
(5.69 and 5.64 using PBE and HSE03).
For both adsorption sites, there are only small changes in the DOS due to the introduction of exact
exchange. In particular, for the hollow site, we note that the peak corresponding to the
FORMULA  and FORMULA  hybridization has the same intensity for HSE03 and PBE [panel (c)-CO].
Also the FORMULA  intensity is almost the same as in the PBE case [panel (c)-CO, dashed line]
as confirmed by the FORMULA 
occupation: it is 1.03 and 0.97 electrons using PBE and HSE03. i.e. it decreases by only 6 % using HSE03.
Probably, the most pronounced difference between the FORMULA  Rh and FORMULA  Pt metal is the enhanced FORMULA  occupation,
related to the stronger
binding of the FORMULA  electrons (the shell structure requires that the orbitals are filled in the
order FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  placing the FORMULA  electrons at
significantly larger binding energies than FORMULA  electrons). This effect is further enhanced by the HSE03 functional.
As before, this should stabilizes the CO in the hollow site due to
the increased FORMULA  interaction. Indeed now
the destabilization of the FORMULA  interaction in the hollow site is
not sufficient to yield the top site as preferred adsorption site.

Discussion
Let us start with a brief discussion of the computational aspects of
the current work. We have shown that periodic slab calculations
using hybrid Hartree-Fock density functionals are perfectly feasible
for metallic systems using a plane wave basis set. We have also
shown that the HSE03 functional, suggested by Heyd, Scuseria and
Ernzerhof, yields practically identical results as the more
conventional PBE0 functional, albeit, at a computational cost that
is reduced by almost a factor ten. This is achieved by replacing the
long range part of the Fock-exchange by its density functional
approximation, leading to a rapid k-point convergence of the
non-local exchange and total energies. Thus the HSE03 functional
presents a promising functional for large scale studies of molecules
on surfaces.
Our study concentrated on the chemisorption of the CO molecule on
FORMULA -metal surfaces, specifically Cu(111), Rh(111) and Pt(111). The
study has been pursued using local and generalized gradient density functionals, and
PBE0 and HSE03 hybrid
Hartree-Fock density functionals. As expected, the LDA and GGA functionals give the
wrong site preference for Cu, Rh and Pt. In contrast, the PBE0 and HSE03 functionals reduce this tendency,
predicting the correct site order for CO on Cu(111) and Rh(111). In
both cases, the fcc and hcp sites are destabilized by roughly 150
meV compared to the top site. Unfortunately the HSE03 and PBE0 functionals
do not work so well for Pt(111), where the destabilization is only 50
meV for the fcc site and 80 meV for the hcp site, which is not
sufficient to yield the correct site preference. In
both Rh and Pt, we have made significant efforts applying for
instance different PAW sets and parameters (not all have been
discussed in detail) to make certain that the present numbers are
essentially converged within the theoretical framework.
The wrong site order for Pt is not the only unsatisfactory aspect of
our study; results for the energetics are also largely
disappointing. It is well accepted that gradient corrected
functionals have a tendency to overestimate adsorption energies on
metal surfaces.{{cite:c61cb0a1-7ccb-4f93-aa8c-5607ec4e56a4}}, {{cite:16c5fb4d-17ce-44ef-8ab1-6caa77fbdeb4}} One would have hoped that admixing
a certain fraction of the exact non-local exchange lifts this
deficiency, but this hope is not fulfilled by the PBE0 and HSE03
functionals. In fact, Cu is the only case where the hybrid
functionals improve the overall energetics. This is related to the
upshift of the empty CO FORMULA  orbital and a simultaneous
downshift of the filled Cu 3FORMULA  states, with both effects reducing,
in concert, the FORMULA  interaction; thus the top site becomes
preferred.
For Rh and Pt, the FORMULA  band is restrained to stay at the Fermi-level,
and for the transition metals the main effect of the inclusion of
non-local exchange is an increase of the FORMULA  bandwidth. This
increase of the FORMULA  bandwidth counteracts the reduced interaction
caused by the upshift of the CO FORMULA  orbital. One therefore
observes that the interaction energies generally increase from PBE,
over HSE03 to PBE0, with the last one yielding the largest FORMULA  band
width and the largest CO-metal interaction energies. In a ball-pack,
the increased metal bandwidth caused by the non-local exchange is the
main origin of problems: it partially restores the CO FORMULA 
interaction that we had aimed to reduce by means of the hybrid
functional. This counterbalance works efficiently for Pt, which has the largest FORMULA  bandwidth
and the largest interaction matrix
elements between molecule and metal states.{{cite:cfdbf746-d7ea-4d3e-a653-a13da01462b1}}
We also qualitatively argued that further contributions in favor of restoring the back-donative interaction
may come from an enhanced interaction of FORMULA  states at the hollow site with antisymmetric combination
of FORMULA  metal states,{{cite:9beaba68-9fcc-4828-8d8b-11c3e1106c36}} but our analysis is not able to quantify and separate FORMULA  and FORMULA  contributions.
Unfortunately, there are reasons to believe that
the inclusion of a significant fraction of the non-local exchange
and the concomitant increase of the FORMULA  bandwidth in transition metals
is the wrong physics. We have already commented on this issue in our
recent work:{{cite:9dbb5e33-dfb4-4f14-b038-fdae24ad63fb}} the analogy between FORMULA  and hybrid
functionals suggests that the amount of non-local exchange should
be chosen system dependent, applying more Hartree-Fock like exchange
in exchange dominated systems such as molecules and large gap insulators.
In metals, on the other hand, the non-local exchange term in
FORMULA  is almost entirely screened by the other electrons, so that the
Coulomb hole term— corresponding to a local potential —becomes
dominant. In metals, the proper description thus involves only a
very weak screened-exchange interaction and the semi-local density
functionals approximation should do a perfectly adequate job. The same
conclusion is reached using the adiabatic connection fluctuation
dissipation theorem (AC-FD).{{cite:e00a3824-6762-49d3-a8b8-b14f334167dd}} In a forthcoming
paper,{{cite:0846544a-d1dd-428f-81d6-c32e3962b5da}} we will present results of hybrid-funtional
calculations of CO adsorption extended to other systems
representative of FORMULA  and FORMULA  metal surfaces, including the B3LYP
functional. Unfortunately, also in this case, the results are
generally discomforting, suggesting that previous reports on the
successful prediction of adsorption energies using B3LYP have to be
considered with suspicion.
We are thus left with the intriguing problem, how to treat two
disparate systems using the same unified theoretical footing. It is difficult to imagine that a hybrid
functional with a fixed amount of non-local exchange is going
to do the job. On passing, we also reiterate
another result for hybrid functionals from Ref. Paier2: the
exchange splitting in transition metals is significantly
overestimated, resulting in too small atomization energies (found
here as well for Pt) and a large overestimation of the magnetic
moment in itinerant magnetic transition metals.

Conclusions
We conclude that, although hybrid functional calculations for metals
and metal surfaces are perfectly feasible, the results are by no
means entirely satisfactory. The agreement with experiment is
improved for CO on Cu(111), but the results are only marginally
improved for CO on Rh(111) (correct site order but much too large
adsorption energies) and hardly improved for CO on Pt(111) (wrong
site order and too large adsorption energies). We have argued that
this failure is related to the inclusion of non-local exchange in
the metal slab which results in an incorrect description of the
metal band width.
