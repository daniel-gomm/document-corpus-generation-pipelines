First we integrate out only a single pair of conjugated modes
with wave vectors FORMULA . Then we are looking for the RG
equation which would describe the transformation of the Hamiltonian
under the integration over a shell
FORMULA , where FORMULA .
We show that the known Wegner–Houghton equation is consistent with the assumption of
a simple superposition of the integration results for FORMULA .
The renormalized action can be expanded in powers of
the FORMULA  coupling constant FORMULA  in the high temperature phase
at FORMULA . We compare the expansion coefficients with those
exactly calculated by the diagrammatic perturbative method, and find
some inconsistency. It causes a question in which sense the Wegner–Houghton
equation is really exact.
Introduction
The renormalization group (RG) approach, perhaps, is the most extensively used one in numerous
studies of critical phenomena {{cite:fc6e47f5-4670-407b-94a7-955ca13823cd}}, {{cite:15aa1ccd-fd89-4f8f-9758-612fc3d2ac5e}}. Particularly, the perturbative RG approach
to the FORMULA  or Ginzburg–Landau model is widely known {{cite:f28bd870-36be-470d-b7c9-a9143426a33f}}, {{cite:5c9aaa2f-a68a-4cdd-b396-fab53664b9c6}}, {{cite:1d8e1984-bef7-475e-930f-354c53601a2f}}, {{cite:a1a2780e-1913-4445-add0-8a3ff5855347}}.
However, the perturbative approach suffers from some problems {{cite:1e32ded5-327e-452f-b522-c061a3805adf}}. Therefore it is interesting to look
for a nonperturbative approach. Historically, nonperturbative RG equations have been developed in parallel
to the perturbative ones. These are so called exact RG equations (ERGE).
The method of deriving such RG equations is close in spirit to the famous Wilson's approach,
where the basic idea is to integrate out the short–wave fluctuations
corresponding to the wave vectors within FORMULA  with the
upper (or ultraviolet) cutoff parameter FORMULA  and the renormalization scale FORMULA .
The oldest nonperturbative equation of this kind, originally presented by
Wegner and Houghton {{cite:71a7a629-f1a4-450b-81cc-43d906f5a40e}}, uses the sharp momentum cutoff. Later,
a similar equation with smooth momentum cutoff has been proposed by Polchinski {{cite:6367955b-a419-43e4-9b9f-966e6ece491f}}.
The RG equations of this class are reviewed in {{cite:476cc5aa-eb2c-4479-9335-0d6278f8d882}}.
According to the known classification {{cite:476cc5aa-eb2c-4479-9335-0d6278f8d882}}, {{cite:19726350-df35-43cd-bd67-5d8179f1450e}},
there is another class of nonperturbative RG equations proposed
by {{cite:3daf7b3c-089e-4925-b75f-44afb950e4e7}} and reviewed in {{cite:19726350-df35-43cd-bd67-5d8179f1450e}}.
Some relevant discussion can be found in {{cite:476cc5aa-eb2c-4479-9335-0d6278f8d882}}, as well.
Such equations describe the variation of an average effective action
FORMULA  depending on the running cutoff scale FORMULA . Here
FORMULA 
is the averaged order–parameter field (for simplicity, we refer to the case of scalar field).
According to {{cite:3daf7b3c-089e-4925-b75f-44afb950e4e7}}, the averaging is performed over volume FORMULA 
such that the fluctuation degrees of freedom with momenta FORMULA  are effectively integrated
out. In fact, the averaging over volume FORMULA 
is the usual block–spin–averaging procedure of the real–space
renormalization. At the same time, the fluctuations with
FORMULA  are suppressed by a smooth infrared cutoff.
As one can judge from {{cite:19726350-df35-43cd-bd67-5d8179f1450e}}, the existence of a deterministic relation
between the configuration of external source FORMULA  and
that of the averaged order parameter FORMULA 
is (implicitly) assumed in the nonperturbative derivation of the RG flow equation.
Namely, it is stated
(see the text between (2.28) and (2.29) in {{cite:19726350-df35-43cd-bd67-5d8179f1450e}}) that
FORMULA  is the inverse of
FORMULA ,
which has certain meaning as a matrix identity.
To make this point clearer, let us consider a toy example FORMULA , where
FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are FORMULA –component
vectors and FORMULA  is a matrix of size FORMULA . In this case
FORMULA  is the element FORMULA  of matrix FORMULA ,
whereas FORMULA  is the element
FORMULA  of the inverse matrix FORMULA .
In the continuum limit FORMULA , this toy example corresponds to a linear
dependence between FORMULA  and FORMULA . The calculation of derivative always
implies the linearisation around some point, so that the matrix identity
used in {{cite:19726350-df35-43cd-bd67-5d8179f1450e}} (as a continuum limit in the above example)
has a general meaning. However, it makes sense only if there exists
a deterministic relation between the configurations of FORMULA 
and FORMULA  or, in a mathematical notation, if there exist
mappings FORMULA 
and FORMULA .
On the other hand, according to the block–averaging, the values of FORMULA  should be
understood as the block–averages. These, of course, are not uniquely
determined by the external sources, but are fluctuating quantities.
So, we are quite sceptical about the exactness of such an approach of averaged effective action.
The integration over fluctuation degrees with momenta FORMULA  does not alter the
behavior of the infrared modes, directly related to the critical exponents.
From this point of view, the approach based on the equations of Wegner–Houghton
and Polchinski type seems to be more natural.
These are widely believed to be the exact
RG equations, although, in view of our currently presented results, it turns out to be
questionable in which sense they are really exact. In any case, the
nonperturbative RG equations
cannot be solved exactly, therefore a suitable truncation is used. The convergence
of several truncation schemes and of the derivative expansion
has been widely studied in {{cite:7268d521-e561-4845-bf97-9cc6a8ed52df}}, {{cite:e5895290-727d-4c39-8aaa-72bd28e4cefe}}, {{cite:45b6ad30-e705-4d1b-b61e-52cc7a38d0af}}, {{cite:12e9ea15-38bb-4db5-9b1b-2f3a7dc50aef}}, {{cite:4c3bfced-81b2-4e27-9a94-e2ebd7566b2c}}. Here {{cite:4c3bfced-81b2-4e27-9a94-e2ebd7566b2c}}
refers to the specific approach of {{cite:3daf7b3c-089e-4925-b75f-44afb950e4e7}}.
A review about all the methods of approximate solution can be found in {{cite:0066b367-e870-4a1a-a069-c70824ff83a3}}.
Another problem is to test and verify the nonperturbative RG equations,
comparing the results with the known exact and rigorous solutions,
as well as with the results of the perturbation theory.
In {{cite:45b6ad30-e705-4d1b-b61e-52cc7a38d0af}}, the derivative expansion of the RG FORMULA –function has been considered,
showing the agreement up to the second order between the perturbative results and those
obtained from the Legendre flow equation, which also belongs to the same class of RG equations
as the Wegner–Houghton and Polchinski equations.
It has been stated in {{cite:7268d521-e561-4845-bf97-9cc6a8ed52df}} that the critical exponent FORMULA , extracted from the Wegner–Houghton
equation in the local potential approximation, agrees with the FORMULA –expansion
up to the FORMULA  order, as well as with the FORMULA 
(FORMULA  in the notations of {{cite:7268d521-e561-4845-bf97-9cc6a8ed52df}})
expansion in the leading order.
However, looking carefully on the results of {{cite:7268d521-e561-4845-bf97-9cc6a8ed52df}}, one should make clear
that “the leading order of the FORMULA  expansion" in this case is no more than
the zeroth order, whereas the expansion coefficient at FORMULA 
is inconsistent with that proposed by the perturbative RG calculation at
any fixed dimension FORMULA  except only FORMULA .
The inconsistency
could be understood from the point of view that the Wegner–Houghton equation
has been solved approximately. Therefore it would be interesting to verify
whether the problem is eliminated beyond the local potential approximation.
One should also take into account that the perturbative
RG theory is not rigorous and, therefore, we think that a possible
inconsistency still would not prove that something is really wrong
with the nonperturbative RG equation.
In any case, it is a remarkable fact that correct RG eigenvalue spectrum and critical
exponents are obtained in the local potential approximation at FORMULA 
from the Wegner–Houghton equation {{cite:7268d521-e561-4845-bf97-9cc6a8ed52df}}, as well as from similar RG
equations {{cite:d647e49d-187d-446f-aad8-e25ae009d6da}},
in agreement with the known exact and rigorous results for the spherical model.
It shows that some solutions, being not exact, nevertheless can lead to exact critical exponents.
From this point of view, it seems also possible that some kind of approximations,
made in the derivation of an RG equation, are not harmful for the critical exponents.
We propose a simple test of the Wegner–Houghton
equation: to verify the expansion of the renormalized action FORMULA  of the FORMULA 
model in powers of the coupling constant FORMULA  at FORMULA  in the high–temperature phase.
Such a test is rigorous, in the sense that the natural domain of validity of the perturbation theory
is considered.
We think that it would be quite natural to start with such a relatively simple and straightforward
test before passing to more complicated ones, considered in {{cite:7268d521-e561-4845-bf97-9cc6a8ed52df}}, {{cite:45b6ad30-e705-4d1b-b61e-52cc7a38d0af}}, {{cite:d647e49d-187d-446f-aad8-e25ae009d6da}}.
We have made this simplest test in our paper and have found that the
Wegner–Houghton equation fails to give all correct expansion coefficients.
We have also proposed another derivation
of the Wegner–Houghton equation (Secs. , ).
It is helpful to clarify the origin of the mentioned inconsistency.
It is also less obscure from the point of view that the
used assumptions and approximations are clearly stated. As regards the derivation in {{cite:71a7a629-f1a4-450b-81cc-43d906f5a40e}},
at least one essential step is obscure and apparently contains an implicit
approximation which, in very essence, is analogous to that pointed out in our derivation.
We will discuss this point in Sec. .

An elementary step of renormalization
To derive a nonperturbative RG equation for the FORMULA  model, we should start with
some elementary steps, as explained in this section.
Consider the action FORMULA  which depends on the configuration of the
order parameter field FORMULA  depending on coordinate FORMULA .
By definition, it is related to the Hamiltonian FORMULA  of the model via FORMULA ,
where FORMULA  is the temperature measured in energy units. In general, FORMULA 
is an FORMULA –component vector with components FORMULA  given in the Fourier
representation as FORMULA ,
where FORMULA  is the volume of the system, FORMULA  is the spatial dimensionality,
and FORMULA  is the upper cutoff of the wave vectors. We consider the action of the
Ginzburg–Landau form. For simplicity, we include only the FORMULA  and FORMULA 
terms. The action of such FORMULA  model is given by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is some function of wave vector FORMULA , e. g.,
FORMULA  like in theories of critical phenomena {{cite:5c9aaa2f-a68a-4cdd-b396-fab53664b9c6}}, {{cite:1d8e1984-bef7-475e-930f-354c53601a2f}}, {{cite:a1a2780e-1913-4445-add0-8a3ff5855347}}, {{cite:1e32ded5-327e-452f-b522-c061a3805adf}}.
In the sums we set FORMULA  for FORMULA .
The renormalization group (RG) transformation implies the integration over FORMULA 
for some set of wave vectors with FORMULA , i. e.,
the Kadanoff's transformation, followed by certain rescaling procedure {{cite:5c9aaa2f-a68a-4cdd-b396-fab53664b9c6}}.
The action under the Kadanoff's transformation is changed from FORMULA  to
FORMULA  according to the equation
FORMULA 
Alternatively, one often writes FORMULA  instead of
FORMULA  to separate the constant
part of the action FORMULA . This, however, is merely a redefinition of FORMULA , and for our
purposes it is suitable to use (REF ).
Note that FORMULA 
is a complex number and FORMULA 
holds (since FORMULA  is always real), so that the integration over
FORMULA  means in fact the integration over real and imaginary parts of FORMULA 
for each pair of conjugated wave vectors FORMULA  and FORMULA .
The Kadanoff's transformation (REF ) can be split in a sequence of elementary steps
FORMULA  of the repeated integration given by
FORMULA 
for each FORMULA  and FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the subset of independent wave vectors
(FORMULA  represent one independent mode) within FORMULA .
Thus, in the first elementary step of renormalization we have to insert the original
action (REF ) into (REF ) and perform the integration for one
chosen FORMULA  and FORMULA . In an exact treatment we must take into account
that the action is already changed in the following elementary steps.
For FORMULA ,
we can use the following exact decomposition of (REF )
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
Here the sums are marked by a prime to indicate that terms containing FORMULA  are omitted.
This is simply a splitting of (REF ) into parts with all possible powers of FORMULA .
The condition FORMULA , as well as the existence of the upper
cutoff for the wave vectors,
ensures that terms of the third power are absent in (REF ).
Besides, the derivation is performed formally considering all FORMULA 
as independent variables.
Taking into account (REF ), as well as the fact that FORMULA 
and FORMULA  are complex numbers, the transformed action after the first elementary
renormalization step reads
FORMULA 
Considering only the field configurations which are relevant in the thermodynamic limit FORMULA ,
Eq. (REF ) can be simplified, omitting the terms with FORMULA  and FORMULA . Really, using the coordinate
representation FORMULA , we can write
FORMULA 
The quantity FORMULA  is an average
of FORMULA  over the volume with oscillating weight factor FORMULA .
This quantity vanishes for relevant configurations in the thermodynamic limit: due to
the oscillations, positive and negative contributions are similar in magnitude and cancel at FORMULA .
Since FORMULA  is the Fourier transform of the two–point correlation
function, it is bounded at FORMULA  and, hence, FORMULA  also is bounded for
relevant configurations giving nonvanishing contribution to the statistical averages FORMULA 
in the thermodynamic limit. Consequently, for these configurations, FORMULA  is a quantity of order FORMULA ,
whereas FORMULA  and FORMULA  vanish at FORMULA . Note, however,
that the term with FORMULA  in (REF )
cannot be neglected unless FORMULA  is positive. One can judge that the latter condition is satisfied for
the relevant field configurations due to existence of the thermodynamic limit for the RG flow.
Omitting the terms with FORMULA  and FORMULA , the integrals in (REF ) can be easily calculated. It yields
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the original action, where only the FORMULA  modes of the FORMULA -th field component
are omitted, whereas FORMULA  represents the elementary variation of
the action given by
FORMULA 
According to the arguments provided above, this equation is exact for the relevant
field configurations with FORMULA  in the thermodynamic limit.
The contributions to (REF ) and () provided by modes with wave vectors FORMULA , obeying two
relations FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
are irrelevant in the thermodynamic limit at FORMULA .
It can be verified by the method of analysis introduced in Sec. .
Hence, Eq. (REF ) can be written as
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
and FORMULA  is a vanishingly small correction
in the considered limit.
Here the operators FORMULA  set to zero all FORMULA 
within the shell FORMULA  (i. e., the derivatives are
evaluated at zero FORMULA  for FORMULA  within the shell),
and the upper border FORMULA  for sums implies that we set FORMULA 
for FORMULA .
The above replacements are meaningful, since they allow to obtain easily the
Wegner–Houghton equation, as discussed in the following section.

Superposition hypothesis and the  Wegner–Houghton equation
Intuitively, it could seem very reasonable that the result of integration over Fourier modes
within the shell FORMULA  at FORMULA  can be represented as a
superposition of elementary contributions given by (REF ), neglecting the
irrelevant corrections FORMULA .
We will call this idea the superposition hypothesis.
We remind, however, that strictly exact treatment requires a sequential integration
of FORMULA  over a set of FORMULA .
The renormalized action changes after each such integration, and these changes influence
the following steps.
A problem is to estimate the discrepancy between the results of two methods:
(1) the exact integration and (2) the superposition approximation.
Since it is necessary to perform infinitely many integration steps
in the thermodynamic limit, the problem is nontrivial and the
superposition hypothesis cannot be rigorously justified.
Nevertheless, the summation of elementary contributions in accordance with the superposition
hypothesis leads to the known Wegner–Houghton equation {{cite:71a7a629-f1a4-450b-81cc-43d906f5a40e}}. In this case the variation
of the action due to the integration over shell reads
FORMULA 
It is exactly consistent with Eq. (2.13) in {{cite:71a7a629-f1a4-450b-81cc-43d906f5a40e}}.
The factor FORMULA  appears, since only half of the wave vectors represent independent modes.
Here we have indicated that the quantities FORMULA  and FORMULA  depend on the current
FORMULA  and FORMULA . They depend also on the considered field configuration
FORMULA . If FORMULA  and FORMULA  are represented by the derivatives of FORMULA 
(see (REF ) and ()), then the equation is written exactly as in {{cite:71a7a629-f1a4-450b-81cc-43d906f5a40e}}.
To avoid possible confusion, one has to make clear that the operators
FORMULA  in (REF ) and () influence
the result, as discussed further on. It means that the equation
where these operators are simply omitted, referred
in the review paper {{cite:476cc5aa-eb2c-4479-9335-0d6278f8d882}} as the Wegner–Houghton
equation, is not really the Wegner–Houghton equation.
The derivation in {{cite:71a7a629-f1a4-450b-81cc-43d906f5a40e}} is somewhat different. Instead of performing only one
elementary step of integration first, the expansion of Hamiltonian in terms of all shell variables
is made there. The basic method of {{cite:71a7a629-f1a4-450b-81cc-43d906f5a40e}} is to show that, in the thermodynamic
limit at FORMULA , the expansion consists of terms containing no more than
two derivatives with respect to the field components. Moreover, it is assumed
implicitly that only the diagonal terms
with FORMULA  are important finally, when performing the
summation over the wave vectors FORMULA . It leads to Eq. (2.12) in {{cite:71a7a629-f1a4-450b-81cc-43d906f5a40e}}. The omitting
of nondiagonal terms is equivalent to the superposition assumption we
discussed already. Indeed, in this and only in this case the integration
over the shell variables can be performed independently, as if the superposition
principle were hold. Hence, essentially the same approximation is used in {{cite:71a7a629-f1a4-450b-81cc-43d906f5a40e}}
as in our derivation, although it is not stated explicitly.
Our derivation refers to the FORMULA  model, whereas in the form with derivatives
the equation may have a more general validity, as supposed in {{cite:71a7a629-f1a4-450b-81cc-43d906f5a40e}}. Indeed, (REF )
remains correct for a generalized model provided that higher than second order derivatives of FORMULA 
vanish for relevant field configurations in the thermodynamic limit. It, in fact, has
been assumed and shown in {{cite:71a7a629-f1a4-450b-81cc-43d906f5a40e}}.
Based on similar arguments we have used already, the latter assumption can be justified
for certain class of models, for which the action is represented by a linear combination
of FORMULA –kind terms with wave–vector dependent weights and vanishing sum of
the wave vectors FORMULA  related to the FORMULA  factors.
In this case we have
FORMULA 
for the relevant configurations at FORMULA  and FORMULA .
The second term in (REF ) appears because the derivative FORMULA 
contains relevant terms with FORMULA , which have to be removed.
The influence of the operators FORMULA  is seen from (REF ) and (REF ).
Here we do not include the second, i. e., the rescaling
step of the RG transformation. It, however, can be easily calculated for any given action,
as described, e. g., in {{cite:5c9aaa2f-a68a-4cdd-b396-fab53664b9c6}}. It is not relevant four our further considerations.

The weak coupling limit
Here we consider
the weak coupling limit FORMULA  of the model with FORMULA  at
a given positive FORMULA , i. e., in the high temperature phase.
In this case FORMULA  can be expanded in powers
of FORMULA . It is the natural domain of validity of the perturbation
theory, and the expansion coefficients can be calculated exactly by the known
methods applying the Feynman diagram technique and the
Wick's theorem {{cite:5c9aaa2f-a68a-4cdd-b396-fab53664b9c6}}, {{cite:1d8e1984-bef7-475e-930f-354c53601a2f}}, {{cite:19726350-df35-43cd-bd67-5d8179f1450e}}.
On the other hand, the expansion can be performed in (REF ).
Our aim is to compare the results of both methods to check the correctness of (REF ),
since the latter equation is based on assumptions.
Let us denote by FORMULA  the variation of FORMULA  omitting
the constant (independent of the field configuration) part. Then the expansion in powers of FORMULA  reads
FORMULA 
where the expansion coefficient at FORMULA  is split in three parts FORMULA ,
FORMULA , and FORMULA  corresponding to the FORMULA ,
FORMULA , and FORMULA  contributions, respectively.
The contribution of order FORMULA  is related to the diagram 
 , whereas the three second–order
contributions — to the diagrams 
 , 

100(15,3)(25,11)(35,3)
100(15,3)(25,-5)(35,3)
 , and 
 .
The diagram technique represents the expansion of FORMULA  in terms
of connected Feynman diagrams, where the coupled lines are associated with the
Gaussian averages. In particular, the Fourier transformed two–point correlation function in
the Gaussian approximation
FORMULA 
appears due to the integration over FORMULA  and FORMULA .
It is represented as the coupling of lines, in such a way that each line related to the wave vector
FORMULA  and vector–component FORMULA  is coupled with another line having the
wave vector FORMULA  and the same component FORMULA . Thus, if we integrate
over FORMULA  within FORMULA 
in (REF ), then it corresponds to the coupling of lines in the same
range of wave vectors in the diagram technique. According
to the Wick's theorem, one has to sum over all possible couplings,
which finally yields the summation (integration) over the wave vectors
obeying the constraint FORMULA 
for each of the coupled lines associated with the factors
FORMULA . In the FORMULA –component case, it is suitable to represent the FORMULA  vertex
as 
 , where the same index FORMULA  is associated with two solid lines
connected to one node. The above diagrams are given by the sum of all possible couplings of the
vertices 
 , yielding the corresponding topological pictures when the dashed lines
shrink to points. In this case factor FORMULA  corresponds to each closed loop of solid lines,
which comes from the summation over FORMULA . For a complete definition of the diagram technique,
one has to mention that factors FORMULA  are related to the dashed lines,
FORMULA  – to the coupled solid lines, and the
fields FORMULA  – to the outer uncoupled solid lines. Besides, each diagram
contains a combinatorial factor. For a diagram consisting of FORMULA  vertices

 , it is the number of all possible couplings of (numbered) lines, divided by FORMULA .
At FORMULA , the diagrammatic calculation for the FORMULA –component case yields
FORMULA 
where FORMULA , FORMULA  is the area of unit sphere in FORMULA  dimensions,
FORMULA  is the value of FORMULA  at FORMULA ,
whereas FORMULA  is a cutoff function which has the value
1 within FORMULA  and zero otherwise. The quantity FORMULA  is given by
FORMULA 
Below we will give some details of calculation of (), which is the
most important term in our further discussion.
To obtain this result, we have dechipered the 

100(15,3)(25,11)(35,3)
100(15,3)(25,-5)(35,3)
 diagram as
a sum of three diagrams of different topologies made of vertices

 , i. e., 
 , 
 , and 
 ,
providing the same topological picture 

100(15,3)(25,11)(35,3)
100(15,3)(25,-5)(35,3)
 when shrinking the dashed lines
to points. Recall that any loop made of solid lines of 
 gives a factor FORMULA ,
and one needs also to compute the combinatorial factors.
For the above three diagrams, the resulting factors are FORMULA , 16, and
16, which enter the prefactors of FORMULA  in ().
To obtain the correct sign, we recall that the diagram expansion is for
FORMULA . The other diagrams are calculated in a similar way.
The expansion of (REF ) gives no contribution FORMULA ,
and we have skipped it in the diagrammatic calculation as an irrelevant
term, which vanishes faster than FORMULA  at FORMULA 
in the thermodynamic limit FORMULA .
The expansion of the logarithm term in (REF ) yields FORMULA 
exactly consistent with (REF ). Similarly,
FORMULA  is exactly consistent with ().
One has to remark that two propogators are involved in (REF ) and, therefore,
the volume of summation region with nonvanishing cut function FORMULA 
shrinks as FORMULA  for a given nonzero wave vector FORMULA  at FORMULA .
However, there is a contribution linear in FORMULA 
for FORMULA . As a result, a contribution
proportional to FORMULA  appears in ().
Note that the contributions (REF ) and () come
from diagrams with only one coupled line. The term () is related to the diagram
with two coupled lines. The expansion of (REF )
provides a different result for the corresponding part of FORMULA :
FORMULA 
Note that (REF ) comes from the FORMULA  term in (REF ),
and the calculation is particularly simple
in this case, since the related sum in () is independent of FORMULA .
Eq. (REF ) is obtained if we set
FORMULA 
in () (in this case only the diagonal terms FORMULA  are
relevant when summing up the contributions with
FORMULA , as it can be shown by
an analysis of relevant real–space configurations, since
FORMULA  holds for FORMULA ).
It means that a subset of terms is missing in (REF ), as compared to ().
The following analysis will show that this discrepancy between () and (REF )
is important.
It is interesting to mention that (REF ) is obtained also by the diagrammatic perturbation
method if we first integrate out only the mode with FORMULA  and then formally
apply the superposition hypothesis, as in the derivation of the Wegner–Houghton equation.
It shows that the discrepancy between (REF ) and () arises because in one
case the superposition hypothesis is applied, whereas in the other
case it is not used.
The difference between () and (REF ) can be better seen in the coordinate
representation. In this case () reads
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
is the Fourier transform of FORMULA , and FORMULA .
In three dimensions we have
FORMULA 
for any given FORMULA  at FORMULA  and FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the linear system size.
The continuum approximation (REF ), however, is not correct for FORMULA  and therefore,
probably, should not be used for the evaluation of (REF ).
The coordinate representation of (REF ) is
FORMULA 
Eq. (REF ) represents a relevant contribution at FORMULA ,
as it is proportional to FORMULA . It is obviously not consistent with (REF ).
In fact, the term (REF ) represents
a mean-field interaction, which is proportional to FORMULA  and independent of the distance,
whereas (REF ) corresponds to another non-local interaction given by FORMULA .
Hence, the Wegner–Houghton equation (REF ) does not yield all correct expansion coefficients
at FORMULA .

Discussion
The results of our test, stated at the end of Sec. ,
reveal some inconsistency between the Wegner–Houghton equation
and the diagrammatic perturbation theory in the high temperature phase at FORMULA .
Since this is the natural domain of validity of the perturbation
theory, there should be no doubts that it produces correct results here, which
agree with (REF ).
So, the results of our test point to some inconsistency between the
Wegner–Houghton equation and (REF ), which
causes a question in which sense the Wegner–Houghton equation is really exact.
The same can be asked about the equations of Polchinski type, since these
(as it is believed) are generalizations of the Wegner–Houghton equation to
the case of smooth momentum cutoff.
There is no contradiction with the tests of consistency made in {{cite:7268d521-e561-4845-bf97-9cc6a8ed52df}}, {{cite:45b6ad30-e705-4d1b-b61e-52cc7a38d0af}},
since our test is independent and quite different.
According to our derivation of the Wegner–Houghton equation and the related discussion,
it turns out that the reason of the inconsistency, likely, is the superposition
approximation (defined at the beginning of Sec. )
used in our paper and analogous approximation implicitly used in {{cite:71a7a629-f1a4-450b-81cc-43d906f5a40e}}.
Despite of this problem, the Wegner–Houghton equation is able to reproduce
the exact RG eigenvalue spectrum and critical exponents of the spherical model
at FORMULA  {{cite:7268d521-e561-4845-bf97-9cc6a8ed52df}}. This fact can be interpreted in such a way
that the superposition approximation (or an analogous approximation) is valid
to derive such nonperturbative RG equations, which can produce correct
(exact) critical exponents in some limit cases, at least.
From a general point of view, it concerns the fundamental question
about the relation between the form of RG equation and the universal quantities.
It has been verified in several known studies that the universal quantities are
invariant with respect to some kind of variations in the RG equation, like
changes in the shape of the momentum cutoff function. This property is known as
the reparametrisation invariance {{cite:476cc5aa-eb2c-4479-9335-0d6278f8d882}}. Probably, the universal
quantities are invariant also with respect to such a variation
of the Wegner–Houghton equation, which makes it exactly consistent with (REF ).
However, this is only a hypothesis.

Conclusions

The nonperturbative Wegner–Houghton RG equation has been rederived
(Secs.  and ), discussing explicitly
some assumptions which are used here. In particular, our derivation assumes the
superposition of small contributions provided by elementary integration steps over
the short–wave fluctuation modes. We consider it as an approximation.
As discussed in Sec. , the original derivation by Wegner and Houghton
includes essentially the same approximation, although not stated explicitly.

According to our calculation in Sec. , the Wegner–Houghton
equation is not completely consistent with the diagrammatic
perturbation theory in the limit of small FORMULA  coupling constant FORMULA  in the
high temperature phase.
This fact, together with some other important results known from literature,
is discussed in Sec. .
Apart from critical remarks, a hypothesis has been proposed that
the equations of Wegner–Houghton type, perhaps, can give exact
universal quantities.
