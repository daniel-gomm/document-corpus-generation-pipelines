The ever-increasing knowledge to the structure of various real-world
networks has uncovered their complex multi-mechanism-governed
evolution processes. Therefore, a better understanding to the
structure and evolution of these networked complex systems requires
us to describe such processes in more detailed and realistic manner.
In this paper, we introduce a new type of network growth rule which
comprises of adding and deleting of nodes, and propose an evolving
network model to investigate the effect of node deleting on network
structure. It is found that, with the introduction of node deleting,
network structure is significantly transformed. In particular,
degree distribution of the network undergoes a transition from
scale-free to exponential forms as the intensity of node deleting
increases. At the same time, nontrivial disassortative degree
correlation develops spontaneously as a natural result of network
evolution in the model. We also demonstrate that node deleting
introduced in the model does not destroy the connectedness of a
growing network so long as the increasing rate of edges is not
excessively small. In addition, it is found that node deleting will
weaken but not eliminate the small-world effect of a growing
network, and generally it will decrease the clustering coefficient
in a network.
INTRODUCTION
Network structure is of great importance in the topological
characterization of complex systems in reality. Actually, these
networked complex systems have been found to share some common
structural characteristics, such as the small-world properties, the
power-law degree distribution, the degree correlation, and so on
{{cite:d60f7e6d-c5ba-4033-88ec-aed8d242076d}}, {{cite:91bf5d2c-5fe6-4132-9436-dbe07abd101f}}, {{cite:aec43104-a14c-460a-9d9d-ba22e06752d5}}. In the theoretical description of these findings, the
Watts-Strogatz (WS) model {{cite:841905e2-99dd-4ebe-a1c5-e3e3be950897}} provides a simple way to generate
networks with the small-world properties. Barabási and Albert
(BA) {{cite:d08141ba-d67e-4ad5-a0b8-8f1e467958ed}}, with a somewhat different aim, proposed an evolving
network model to explain the origin of power-law degree
distribution. In this model, by considering two fundamental
mechanisms: growth and preferential attachment (PA), power-law
degree distribution emerges naturally from network evolution. Based
on the framework of BA model, many other mechanisms were introduced
into network evolution to reproduce some more complex observed
network structures {{cite:8ac94cbc-6a8f-42be-8ecf-290f4c54f789}}, {{cite:75062eed-f8ac-47f1-b465-8b93a3f76ec4}}, {{cite:3ff2071e-bf45-4639-897d-f96a8984dcd3}}, {{cite:2490b297-3399-4489-9c00-738c9a467574}}, {{cite:78c033c1-a69c-4fe0-b6e2-319de48ae377}}, {{cite:615cbbf8-7c3c-4dfc-ac25-50553c22ac69}}, {{cite:a1eac66f-c4d0-4b48-833a-40d5cb78d9fc}}, {{cite:04635f7d-6ff8-4939-869d-f1902281d4f7}}, {{cite:a49ddbe6-6d56-4f8d-bf36-99fb1c324c55}}, {{cite:066ec6bc-7c4d-4452-9e47-deb283e78621}}, {{cite:064ab755-2ad2-4bce-941f-236011124ead}}, {{cite:c99b4480-1fe7-4174-99de-b4e750e831ca}}, such as
the degree distribution of broad scale and single scale {{cite:8ac94cbc-6a8f-42be-8ecf-290f4c54f789}}, as
well as the degree correlation {{cite:c99b4480-1fe7-4174-99de-b4e750e831ca}}. These further studies show
that real networked systems may undergo a very complex evolution
process governed by multiple mechanisms on which the occurrence of
network structures depends. Therefore, to get a better understanding
of the structure and evolution of complex networks, describing such
processes in more detailed and realistic manner is necessary.
In the BA's framework, the growing nature of real-world networks is
captured by a BA-type growth rule. According to this rule, one node
is added into the network at each time step, intending to mimic the
growing process of real systems. This rule gives an explicit
description to the real-network' growing process which, however, can
in fact be much more complex. One fact is that in many real growing
networks, there are constant adding of new elements, but accompanied
by permanent removal of old elements (deletion of nodes)
{{cite:fa08221c-d8f5-4ffd-82ca-e14642af148d}}, {{cite:2600120d-a2ab-4188-a3fe-93ebb13efe80}}, {{cite:9111ca1d-be20-47cf-b5fb-b3e69aa99364}}, {{cite:e43b6091-3b1c-4bd8-9813-b22838ff556a}}, {{cite:f4b71e45-510c-4a9d-8093-959580c9611a}}, {{cite:53f36e34-7059-44ea-a3d9-21b3c2b38145}}. Take the food webs for a example: there
are both additions and losses of nodes (species) at ecological and
evolutionary time scales by means of immigration, emigration,
speciation, and extinction {{cite:fa08221c-d8f5-4ffd-82ca-e14642af148d}}. Likewise, for Internet and the
World Wide Web (WWW), node-deleting is reported experimentally in
spit of their rapid expansion of size {{cite:2600120d-a2ab-4188-a3fe-93ebb13efe80}}, {{cite:9111ca1d-be20-47cf-b5fb-b3e69aa99364}}, {{cite:e43b6091-3b1c-4bd8-9813-b22838ff556a}}, {{cite:f4b71e45-510c-4a9d-8093-959580c9611a}}, {{cite:53f36e34-7059-44ea-a3d9-21b3c2b38145}}. In the
Internet's Autonomous Systems (ASs) map case, a node is an AS and a
link is a relationship between two ASs. An AS adding means a new
Internet Service Provider (ISP) or a large institution with multiple
stub networks joins the Internet. An AS deleting happens due to the
permanent shutdown of the corresponding AS as it is, for example,
out of business. Investigations of the evolution of real Internet
maps from 1997 to 2000 verified such network mechanism
{{cite:2600120d-a2ab-4188-a3fe-93ebb13efe80}}, {{cite:9111ca1d-be20-47cf-b5fb-b3e69aa99364}}, {{cite:e43b6091-3b1c-4bd8-9813-b22838ff556a}}. The same is for the evolution of WWW, in which the
deletions of invalid web pages are also frequently discovered
{{cite:f4b71e45-510c-4a9d-8093-959580c9611a}}, {{cite:53f36e34-7059-44ea-a3d9-21b3c2b38145}}. In most cases, the deletion of a node is also
accompanied with the removal of all edges once attached to it. These
facts justify the investigation of node-deletion's influence on
network structure. In this paper, we introduce a new type of network
growth rule which comprises of adding and deleting of nodes, and
propose an evolving network model to investigate the effect of node
deleting on the network structure. Before now several authors have
proposed some models on node removal in networks, such as AJB
networks in which a portion nodes are simultaneously removed from
the network {{cite:58ca0ba3-3ced-4d9a-b661-0d855db2c62c}}, and also the decaying {{cite:49d66f20-01ae-4174-a58d-e17c07aa5bd1}} and mortal
{{cite:0491982e-d7b4-47e2-83c3-63f29dc775f6}} networks, which concerns networks' scaling property and
critical behavior respectively. Sarshar et al {{cite:ac242def-1ba1-41e3-9e37-8f84aa15690a}}
investigated the ad hoc network with node removal, focusing
on the compensatory process to preserve true scale-free state. They
are different from present work, in which node deleting is treated
as an ubiquitous mechanism accompanied with the evolution of
real-world networks.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section , an
evolving network model taking account of the effect of node deleting
is introduced which reduces to a generalized BA model when the
effect of node deleting vanishes. Then the effect of node deleting
on network structure are investigated in five aspects: degree
distribution (Section ), degree correlation
(Section ), size of giant component
(Section ), average distance between nodes
(Section ) and clustering (Section ). Finally,
Section  presents a brief summary.

THE MODEL
We consider the following model. In the initial state, the network
has FORMULA  isolated nodes. At each time step, either a new node is
added into the network with probability FORMULA  or a randomly chosen
old node is deleted from the network with probability FORMULA ,
where FORMULA  is an adjustable parameter. When a new node is added to
the network, it connects to FORMULA  (FORMULA ) existing node in
the network according to the preferential probability introduced in
the BA model {{cite:d08141ba-d67e-4ad5-a0b8-8f1e467958ed}}, which reads
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the degree of node FORMULA . When an old node is
deleted from the network, edges once attached to it are removed as
well. In the model, FORMULA  is varied in the range of FORMULA ,
since in the case of FORMULA  the network can not grow. In
order to give a chance for isolated nodes to receive a new edge, we
choose preferential probability FORMULA  proportional to
FORMULA  {{cite:75062eed-f8ac-47f1-b465-8b93a3f76ec4}}. Note that when FORMULA , our model reduces to
a generalized BA model {{cite:f5ab1082-b527-4ae3-8f56-38ae3f35ba91}}.
To get a general knowledge to the effect of node deleting on network
structure, firstly, a simple analysis to the surviving probability
FORMULA  is helpful. Here, FORMULA  is defined as the probability
that a node is added into the network at time step FORMULA , and this
node (the FORMULA th node) has not been deleted until time step FORMULA ,
where FORMULA . Supposing that a node-adding event happens at
time step FORMULA , and the probability that the FORMULA th node has not
been deleted until time step FORMULA  is denoted as FORMULA . Then, due
to the independence of events happened at each time step, it is easy
to verify that FORMULA  with
FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the number of nodes in the
network at moment FORMULA  (in the limit of large FORMULA ). In the continuous
limit, we obtain
FORMULA 
which yields
FORMULA 
Thus to get the FORMULA  we should multiply FORMULA  with FORMULA ,
i.e.
FORMULA 
One can easily find that FORMULA  decreases rapidly as FORMULA  increases
and/or as FORMULA  decreases provided FORMULA . It is well known that
highly connected nodes, or hubs, play very important roles in the
structural and functional properties of growing networks
{{cite:d60f7e6d-c5ba-4033-88ec-aed8d242076d}}, {{cite:91bf5d2c-5fe6-4132-9436-dbe07abd101f}}, {{cite:aec43104-a14c-460a-9d9d-ba22e06752d5}}. The formation of hubs needs a long time to gain a
large number of connections. As a consequence, according to
Eq. (REF ), a large portion of potential hubs are deleted
during the network evolution. Thus it can be expected that the
introduction of node deleting has nontrivial effects on network
structure. In the following we show how network structure can be
effected by the node deleting introduced in present model.

DEGREE DISTRIBUTION
The degree distribution FORMULA , which gives the probability that a
node in the network possesses FORMULA  edges, is a very important
quantity to characterize network structure. In fact, FORMULA  has been
suggested to be used as the first criteria to classify real-world
networks {{cite:8ac94cbc-6a8f-42be-8ecf-290f4c54f789}}. Therefore it is necessary to investigate the
effect of node deleting on the degree distribution of networks
firstly. Now we adopt the continuous approach {{cite:e5255a23-6058-4818-80b6-580a6cf54c1a}} to give a
qualitative analysis of FORMULA  for our model with slight node
deletion (i.e., when FORMULA  is very small). Supposing that there is a
node added into the network at time step FORMULA , and this node is
still in the network at time FORMULA , let FORMULA  be the degree of the
FORMULA th node at time FORMULA , where FORMULA . Then the increasing
rate of FORMULA  is
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
and the FORMULA  denotes the sum of all FORMULA  during the time
step between 0 and FORMULA . It is easy to verify that the first term
in Eq. (REF ) is the increasing number of links of the FORMULA th
node due to the preferential attachment made by the newly added
node. The second term in Eq. (REF ) accounts for the losing of
a link of the FORMULA th node during the process of node deletion, which
happened with the probability FORMULA .
Firstly we solve for the FORMULA  and get
FORMULA 
(see the Appendix for details). Inserting Eq. (REF ) back into
Eq. (REF ), one gets
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
When FORMULA , the solution of Eq. (REF ) is
FORMULA 
Now, to get the probability FORMULA  that a randomly selected node
at time FORMULA  will have degree FORMULA , we need to calculate the expected
number of nodes FORMULA  with degree FORMULA  at time FORMULA . Then the
FORMULA  can be obtained from FORMULA , where FORMULA  is
the total number of nodes at time FORMULA . Let FORMULA  represent the
set of all possible nodes with degree FORMULA  at time FORMULA , then one gets
FORMULA 
In the continuous-time approach, the number of nodes in FORMULA  is
the number of FORMULA 's for which FORMULA , and
it is approximated to FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the solution of the
equation FORMULA . To proceed with our analysis, now we make the
approximation that all nodes in FORMULA  have the same surviving
probability FORMULA  It seems that this is not a very
good approximation, since investigations indicate that values of
FORMULA  are large and
increase rapidly with the decrease of FORMULA . Thus the analysis here
is a qualitative one and only suit for the condition of slight node
deletion in the model.. Under this mean-field approximation,
Eq. (REF ) can be written as
FORMULA 
From Eq. (REF ), we obtain
FORMULA 
then
FORMULA 
Inserting Eq. (REF ) back into Eq. (REF ) we get
FORMULA 
Inserting Eqs. (REF ) and  (REF ) into
Eq. (REF ), and noting that FORMULA , we get
FORMULA 

which is a generalized power-law form with the exponent
FORMULA 
FIGURE 
We point out again that equation (REF ) is only valid when
FORMULA , which translates into FORMULA , i.e.
FORMULA 
Considering that FORMULA , Eq. (REF ) is satisfied when
FORMULA 
In Fig. REF , we plot FORMULA  as a function of FORMULA . One can
see from Fig. REF  that the curve divides our model into two
regimes. FORMULA  FORMULA : in this case FORMULA  and equation
(REF ) is valid. Thus, the degree distribution of the network
FORMULA  exhibits a generalized power-law form. FORMULA 
FORMULA : In this case FORMULA  can not be always satisfied
and equation (REF ) is not valid. Therefore, our continuous
approach fails to predict the behavior of FORMULA , and we will
investigate it with numerical simulations. The FORMULA , as
one can find from Fig. REF , decreases with the increase of
FORMULA .
In the power-law regime [FORMULA ], the behavior of FORMULA 
is predicted by Eqs. (REF ) and (REF ), which are
obtained using a mean-field approximation [Eq. (REF )]. One
can easily verify that such approximation is only exact when
FORMULA , in which case Eq. (REF ) turns into FORMULA ,
in good agreement with the results obtained from generalized BA
model studied in Ref {{cite:f5ab1082-b527-4ae3-8f56-38ae3f35ba91}}. If FORMULA ,
Eqs. (REF ) and (REF ) still give qualitative
predictions for the model: with slight node deletion, FORMULA  of the
network is still power-law, and the exponential FORMULA  increases
with the decrease of FORMULA  (inset of Fig. REF ).
In remaining regime [FORMULA ], the limiting case is
FORMULA , in which the growth of network is suppressed (a
very slowly growing one). Similar non-growing networks have been
studied, for example, for the Model B in Ref{{cite:b75adf67-40ce-481f-bf14-b19ce5f277ec}}, and the
degree distribution has the exponential form. Here we conjecture
that, in this regime, FORMULA  of our model crossovers to an
exponential form, which is verified by the numerical simulation
results below.
FIGURE 
Now we verify the above analysis with numerical simulations. In
Fig. REF , we give the cumulative degree distributions FORMULA 
{{cite:aec43104-a14c-460a-9d9d-ba22e06752d5}} of the networks with different FORMULA . As FORMULA  gradually
decreases from 1 to FORMULA , Fig. REF  shows an interesting
transition process which can be roughly divided into three stages.
FORMULA  FORMULA : In this stage, the model works
in the power-law regime and the power-law exponent FORMULA 
increases as FORMULA  decreases. Inset of Fig. REF  gives the
comparison between the value of FORMULA  predicted by
Eq. (REF ) and the one obtained from numerical simulations.
One sees that the theory and the simulation results are in perfect
agreement for FORMULA . As FORMULA  decreases, however, the agreement is
only qualitative and the deviation between theory and simulation
becomes more and more obvious. As we have mentioned above, such
increasing deviation is due to the mean-field approximation used in
the analysis. These results tell us that slight node deletion does
not cause deviation of the network from scale-free state, but only
increases its power-law exponent. Such robustness of power-low
FORMULA  revealed here gives an explanation to the ubiquity of
scale-free networks in reality. It should be noted that a very
similar robustness has also been found in the study of network
resilience, where simultaneously deleting of a portion of nodes was
taken into account in static scale-free networks {{cite:58ca0ba3-3ced-4d9a-b661-0d855db2c62c}}. FORMULA 
FORMULA : In this stage, the model works in the regime
of FORMULA . As one sees from Fig. REF , FORMULA  of the
network behaviors exponentially. This result indicates that with
manifest node deletion, the network will deviate from scale-free
state and become exponential. FORMULA  FORMULA : In this stage, a
crossover of the model from the power-law regime to the exponential
regime is found, in which the FORMULA  is no longer pure scale-free
but truncated by an exponential tail. As one can see, the truncation
in FORMULA  increases as FORMULA  decreases.
Besides the power-law degree distribution, it is now known that
FORMULA  in real world may deviate from a pure power-law form
{{cite:dfc3c638-5738-4d24-87ec-84ca96a94ca4}}, {{cite:edb13d48-3f17-46a2-bbe6-85eac7db36f7}}, {{cite:4139e2ac-9aad-4357-b3b1-03670c48b0fc}}, {{cite:fa08221c-d8f5-4ffd-82ca-e14642af148d}}, {{cite:d50d5d48-8d77-4673-95e3-632fe896055c}}. According to the extent of deviation, FORMULA 
of real systems has been classified into three groups {{cite:8ac94cbc-6a8f-42be-8ecf-290f4c54f789}}:
scale-free (pure power-law), broad scale (power-law with a
truncation), and single scale (exponential). Many mechanisms, such
as aging {{cite:8ac94cbc-6a8f-42be-8ecf-290f4c54f789}}, {{cite:3ff2071e-bf45-4639-897d-f96a8984dcd3}}, {{cite:2490b297-3399-4489-9c00-738c9a467574}}, cost {{cite:8ac94cbc-6a8f-42be-8ecf-290f4c54f789}}, and information filtering
{{cite:78c033c1-a69c-4fe0-b6e2-319de48ae377}}, have been introduced into network growth to explain these
distributions. Here, the results of Fig. REF  indicate that a
modified version of growth rule can lead to all the three kinds of
FORMULA  in reality, and it provides another explanation for the
origin of the diversity of degree distribution in real-world: such
diversity may be a natural result of network growth.

DEGREE CORRELATION
It has been recently realized that, besides the degree distribution,
structure of real networks are also characterized by degree
correlations {{cite:2600120d-a2ab-4188-a3fe-93ebb13efe80}}, {{cite:37cca37c-af6f-4bcd-a12c-4266fa46d317}}, {{cite:71da0c44-bbb1-43b3-891b-bac379766f7a}}, {{cite:b725c26a-f620-4fc4-a58e-913800226ab1}}, {{cite:1c296cc3-ee38-4c48-89d8-0956fcdaf38b}}. This translates into the fact
that degrees at the end of any given edge in real networks are not
usually independent, but are correlated with one another, either
positively or negatively. A network in which the degrees of adjacent
nodes are positively (negatively) correlated is said to show
assortative (disassortative) mixing by degree. An interesting
observation emerging from the comparing of real networks of
different types is that most social networks appear to be
assortatively mixed, whereas most technological and biological
networks appear to be disassortative. The level of degree
correlation can be quantified by the assortativity coefficient FORMULA 
lying in the range FORMULA , which can be written
as
FORMULA 
for practical evaluation on an observed network, where FORMULA ,
FORMULA  are the degrees of the vertices at the ends of the FORMULA th
edge, with FORMULA  {{cite:37cca37c-af6f-4bcd-a12c-4266fa46d317}}. This formula gives FORMULA 
when the corresponding network is positively (negatively)
correlated, and FORMULA  when there is no correlation Another
way to represent degree correlation is to calculate the mean degree
of the nearest neighbors of a vertex as a function of the degree FORMULA 
of that vertex. Although such way is explicit to characterize degree
correlation for highly heterogeneously organized networks, for less
heterogeneous networks (this is the case in the proposed model when
the intensity of node deleting increases, see Fig. REF ), it may
be very nosy and difficult to interpret. So here we adopt the
assortativity coefficient FORMULA  to characterize degree correlation in
the model..

FIGURE 
Recently, Maslov et al {{cite:a08a5ce0-19cd-42a2-bdae-dc0a54f019a1}} and Park et al
{{cite:705248ac-8496-4c75-81b3-8c6bbabbe2e4}} have proposed a possible explanation for the origin of
such correlation. They show for a network the restriction that there
is at most one edge between any pair of nodes induces negative
degree correlations. This restriction seems to be an universal
mechanism (indeed, there is no double edges in most real networks),
therefore, the authors of Ref. {{cite:705248ac-8496-4c75-81b3-8c6bbabbe2e4}} conjecture that
disassortativity by degree is the normal state of affairs for a
network. Although only a part of the measured correlation can be
explained in the way of Ref. {{cite:705248ac-8496-4c75-81b3-8c6bbabbe2e4}}, this universal mechanism
does give a promising explanation for the origin of degree
correlation observed in real networks of various types.
It will be of great interest to discuss the effect of node deleting
on degree correlation. In Fig. REF , we give the assortativity
coefficient FORMULA  as a function of network size FORMULA , for different
FORMULA  in our model, for FORMULA . As one sees from Fig. REF , for
each value of FORMULA , after a transitory period with finite-size
effect, each FORMULA  of networks tends to reach a steady value. When
FORMULA , FORMULA  as FORMULA  becomes large. This result indicates
that networks in the BA model are uncorrelated, in agreement with
results obtained in previous studies {{cite:37cca37c-af6f-4bcd-a12c-4266fa46d317}}, {{cite:1c296cc3-ee38-4c48-89d8-0956fcdaf38b}}. When FORMULA ,
nontrivial negative degree correlations spontaneously develop as
networks evolve. One can see from Fig. REF  that the steady value
of FORMULA  in the model decreases with the decreasing FORMULA . In
particular, when FORMULA , the value of FORMULA  is about
FORMULA . These results indicate that node deleting leads to
disassortative mixing by degree in evolving networks. To make such
relation more clear, in Fig. REF , we plot FORMULA  of networks in
our model as a function of FORMULA , for different FORMULA . As the
Fig. REF  indicates, when the network size is larger than
40000, the assortativity coefficient FORMULA  is nearly stable. So all
results in Fig. REF  are obtained from networks with FORMULA .
Fig. REF  gives us the same relation between FORMULA  and FORMULA 
shown in Fig. REF . What is more, it tells us that for a given
FORMULA , FORMULA  will increase with the increasing FORMULA . The increment gets
its maximum between FORMULA  and other values. We point out that this
is because when FORMULA , the network has been broke up into small
separate components (see the following section). We can also find
from Fig. REF  that the gap between different curves decreases
with the increasing FORMULA  and the curves tend to merge at large FORMULA .
Now we give some explanations to the above observations. In the BA
model, the network being uncorrelated is the result of a competition
between two factors: the growth and the preferential attachment
(PA). On the one hand, networks with pure growth is positively
correlated. This is because the older nodes, also tending to be
higher degree ones, have a higher probability of being connected to
one another, since they coexisted earlier. In Fig. REF , we
compute the assortativity coefficient FORMULA  of a randomly growing
network, which grows by the growth rule of BA-type, while the newly
added nodes connect to randomly chosen existing ones. As one
can see from Fig. REF  that pure growth leads to positive
FORMULA . On the other hand, the introduction of PA makes the connection
between nodes tend to be negatively correlated, since newly added
nodes (usually low degree ones) prefer to connect to highly
connected ones. Then degree correlation characteristic of the BA
model is determined by this two factors. In Fig. REF , we
plot the average degree of the nearest neighbor FORMULA  as a
function of FORMULA  in the BA model. It is found that nodes with large
FORMULA  show no obvious biases in their connections. But there is a
short disassortative mixing region when FORMULA  is relatively small
(also reported in Ref. {{cite:a61c479a-bec6-48b6-a641-37eb4837c2cd}}, see Fig.1a therein). Such
phenomenon can be explained by the effect of these two factor:
Growth together with PA makes nodes with large FORMULA  equally connect
to both large and small degree nodes, and the latter makes nodes
with small degree be disassortatively connected. Now, we introduce
node-deletion. According to Eq. (REF ), depression of the
growth of large-degree nodes also decreases the connections between
them, therefore makes the correlation negative. We also investigate
the effect of node deleting on the FORMULA  of the randomly growing
network, and obtained similar results. As one sees from
Fig. REF , depression of connections between higher degree
nodes causes the network less positively correlated, and with
stronger node-deletion, negatively correlated. Finally, with regard
to the effect of FORMULA  in this relation (Fig. REF ), larger FORMULA 
means more edges are established according to the PA probability
Eq. (REF ). We conjecture that the orderliness of newly added
nodes connecting to large degree nodes will be weakened by the
increasing randomness as FORMULA  becomes larger, thus leading to a less
negative correlation. Such randomness can not always increase and,
as we see from Fig. REF , for large FORMULA , e.g., FORMULA , the
curves tend to merge together.

SIZE OF GIANT COMPONENT

In a network, a set of connected nodes forms a component. If the
relative size of the largest component FORMULA  in a network approaches a
nonzero value when the network is grown to infinite size, this
component is called the giant component of the network
{{cite:d60f7e6d-c5ba-4033-88ec-aed8d242076d}}, {{cite:91bf5d2c-5fe6-4132-9436-dbe07abd101f}}, {{cite:aec43104-a14c-460a-9d9d-ba22e06752d5}}. In most previously studied growing models
{{cite:d60f7e6d-c5ba-4033-88ec-aed8d242076d}}, {{cite:91bf5d2c-5fe6-4132-9436-dbe07abd101f}}, {{cite:aec43104-a14c-460a-9d9d-ba22e06752d5}}, due to the BA-type growth rule they adopted, there is
only one huge component in the network, i.e., FORMULA . In this
extreme case the network gains a perfect connectedness. The opposite
case of FORMULA  is the extreme of FORMULA , in which case the network,
made up of small components, exhibits no connectedness. Experiments
indicate that some real networks seem to lie in somewhere between
these two extreme: they contain a giant component as well as many
separate components {{cite:91bf5d2c-5fe6-4132-9436-dbe07abd101f}}, {{cite:aec43104-a14c-460a-9d9d-ba22e06752d5}}, {{cite:522f22e5-8ff8-4d05-bddc-1a2c0fb4f123}}, {{cite:645baa78-7529-4aa5-b815-875994bf4d7a}}. For example, According to
Ref.{{cite:522f22e5-8ff8-4d05-bddc-1a2c0fb4f123}}, in May of 1999, the entire WWW, containing
FORMULA  pages, consisted of a giant component of
FORMULA  pages and the disconnected components (DC) of
about FORMULA  pages. In general, the introduction of node
deletion in our model will cause the emergence of separate
components even isolated nodes in the network. What we interest here
is the connectedness of the network. In Fig. REF  we plot the
relative size of the largest component FORMULA  in the model, as a
function of FORMULA , for FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the number of edges
generated with the adding of a new node. One sees from Fig. REF 
that for any FORMULA , a giant component can be observed in
the model if FORMULA . In addition, for the same FORMULA , FORMULA  increase as
the increase of FORMULA . While when FORMULA , the network is found to be
broke up into separate components if FORMULA . For example, when
FORMULA , FORMULA  of the network with FORMULA  rapidly drops to
FORMULA . Inset of Fig. REF  gives the FORMULA  Vs FORMULA  curve for
FORMULA . These results indicate that node deleting does not destroy
the connectedness of a growing network so long as the increasing
rate of edges is not excessively small.

AVERAGE DISTANCE BETWEEN NODES
Now we study the effect of node deletion on networks' average
distance FORMULA  between nodes. Here the distance between any two nodes
is defined as the number of edges along the shortest path connecting
them. It has been revealed that, despite their often large size,
most real networks present a relatively short FORMULA , showing the
so-called small-world effect {{cite:d60f7e6d-c5ba-4033-88ec-aed8d242076d}}, {{cite:91bf5d2c-5fe6-4132-9436-dbe07abd101f}}, {{cite:aec43104-a14c-460a-9d9d-ba22e06752d5}}, {{cite:841905e2-99dd-4ebe-a1c5-e3e3be950897}}. Such an effect has a
more precise meaning: networks are said to show the small-world
effect if the value of FORMULA  scales logarithmically or slower with
network size for fixed mean degree. This logarithmic scaling can be
proved for a variety of network models {{cite:d60f7e6d-c5ba-4033-88ec-aed8d242076d}}, {{cite:91bf5d2c-5fe6-4132-9436-dbe07abd101f}}, {{cite:aec43104-a14c-460a-9d9d-ba22e06752d5}}. As we have
demonstrated in Section , node deleting does not destroy
the connectedness of the network in our model for any FORMULA , since
there is always a giant component exists. Here in our simulation, we
calculate FORMULA  of the giant component of the network in our model
using the ¡°burning algorithm¡± {{cite:aec43104-a14c-460a-9d9d-ba22e06752d5}}. In Fig. REF , we plot
FORMULA  as a function of network size FORMULA , for different FORMULA  in our
model. As one can see from the figure, for any FORMULA , a
logarithmic scaling FORMULA  is obtained, while the proportional
coefficient increases with the decrease of FORMULA . Furthermore, for a
given FORMULA , FORMULA  increases with the decrease of FORMULA . These results
tell us that node deleting will weaken but not eliminate the
small-world effect of a growing network.
FIGURE 

CLUSTERING
Finally, we investigate the effect of node deletion on network's
cluster coefficient FORMULA , which is defined as the average probability
that two nodes connected to a same other node are also connected.
For a selected node FORMULA  with degree FORMULA  in the network, if there
are FORMULA  edges among its FORMULA  nearest neighbors, the cluster
coefficient FORMULA  of node FORMULA  is defined as
FORMULA 
Then the clustering coefficient of the whole network is the average
of all individual FORMULA . In Fig. REF , we plot FORMULA  of
the giant component in the network as a function of network size
FORMULA , for different FORMULA . As one sees from Fig. REF ,
for each FORMULA , the clustering coefficient FORMULA  of our model
decreases with the network size, following approximately a power law
form. Such size-dependent property of FORMULA  is shared by many growing
network model {{cite:d60f7e6d-c5ba-4033-88ec-aed8d242076d}}, {{cite:91bf5d2c-5fe6-4132-9436-dbe07abd101f}}, {{cite:aec43104-a14c-460a-9d9d-ba22e06752d5}}. Moreover, as Fig. REF 
shows, for the same network-size FORMULA , FORMULA  decreases as FORMULA 
decreases. The results of Fig. REF  indicate that node
deleting weakens network's clustering.

CONCLUSION
In summary, we have introduced a new type of network growth rule
which comprises of adding and deleting of nodes, and proposed an
evolving network model to investigate effects of node deleting on
network structure. It has been found that, with the introduction of
node deleting, network structure was significantly transformed. In
particular, degree distribution of the network undergoes a
transition from scale-free to exponential forms as the intensity of
node deleting increased. At the same time, nontrivial disassortative
degree correlation spontaneously develops as a natural result of
network evolution in the model. We also have demonstrated that node
deleting introduced in our model does not destroy the connectedness
of a growing network so long as the increasing rate of edge is not
excessively small. In addition, it has been observed that node
deleting will weaken but not eliminate the small-world effect of a
growing network. Finally, we have found that generally node deleting
will decrease the clustering coefficient in a network. These
nontrivial effects justify further studies of the effect of node
deleting on network function {{cite:aec43104-a14c-460a-9d9d-ba22e06752d5}}, which include topics such as
percolation, information and disease transportation, error and
attack tolerance, and so on.

THE CALCULATION OF  FORMULA
To get FORMULA , we multiply both sides of Eq. (REF ) by
FORMULA  and sum up all FORMULA  between 0 and FORMULA :

To get the above equation we have used the definition of FORMULA 
[Eq. (REF )] and the following equation:
FORMULA 
The left-hand side of Eq. (REF ) can be simplified as:

Substituting the above expression in Eq. (REF ), and noting
that FORMULA  and FORMULA , we get
FORMULA
