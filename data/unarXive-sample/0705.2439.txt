A tight bound on the collection of edges in MSTs of induced subgraphs
Gregory B. Sorkin, Angelika Steger and Rico Zenklusen
Let FORMULA  be a complete FORMULA -vertex graph with distinct positive edge
weights. We prove that for FORMULA , the set consisting of the
edges of all minimum spanning trees (MSTs) over induced subgraphs of FORMULA  with
FORMULA  vertices has at most FORMULA  elements. This proves a
conjecture of Goemans and Vondrak {{cite:5b7ed92d-b736-4cc5-bf88-ba19d36cfa36}}. We also show
that the result is a generalization of Mader's Theorem, which bounds the
number of edges in any edge-minimal FORMULA -connected graph.
Introduction
Let FORMULA  be a complete FORMULA -vertex graph with distinct
positive edge weights.
For any set FORMULA ,
denote by FORMULA  the subgraph of FORMULA  induced by FORMULA .
We will also sometimes write this graph as FORMULA ,
ignoring edges in FORMULA  incident on vertices in FORMULA .
FORMULA  denotes the set of edges in the graph's
minimum spanning tree.
(The MST is unique due to the assumption that the edge
weights are distinct.)
For FORMULA , define
FORMULA 
Note that for FORMULA  we have FORMULA . In
{{cite:5b7ed92d-b736-4cc5-bf88-ba19d36cfa36}}, Goemans and Vondrak considered
the problem of finding a
sparse set of edges which, with high probability,
contain the MST of a random subgraph of FORMULA . In this context
they proved an upper bound on FORMULA , namely that
FORMULA , and they conjectured that one
should be able to improve the bound to FORMULA . In this paper we prove this conjecture.
Theorem 1 
For any complete graph FORMULA  on FORMULA  vertices with distinct positive edge weights,
FORMULA 

As Goemans and Vondrak recognized, the bound is tight:
for any FORMULA  and FORMULA  it is easy to produce edge weights
giving equality in (REF ).
One way is to fix an arbitrary
set FORMULA  with cardinality FORMULA , and partition the
edges FORMULA  into three sets FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  where,
for FORMULA , FORMULA  contains all edges of FORMULA  having
exactly FORMULA  endpoints in FORMULA . Assign arbitrary distinct positive
weights to the edges in FORMULA 
such that all weights on FORMULA  are smaller than those
on FORMULA , which in turn are smaller than those on FORMULA . It
can easily be verified that FORMULA  and thus
FORMULA .
Theorem REF 's assumption
that FORMULA  is complete is not meaningfully restrictive.
If FORMULA  is such that deletion of some FORMULA  vertices leaves it
disconnected, then the notion of FORMULA  does not make sense;
otherwise, it does not matter if other edges of FORMULA  are
simply very costly or are absent.
The bound of Theorem REF  applies equally
if we consider the edge set of MSTs of induced subgraphs of size
at most FORMULA  (rather than exactly that number).
This is an immediate consequence of the following remark.
Remark 2 For any complete graph FORMULA  on FORMULA  vertices with distinct positive edge weights,
and FORMULA ,
FORMULA .

We will show that any edge FORMULA  in FORMULA  is also in FORMULA .
By definition, FORMULA  means that there is
some vertex set FORMULA  of cardinality FORMULA  for which
FORMULA , where FORMULA .
Consider any leaf vertex FORMULA  of FORMULA , with neighbor FORMULA .
We claim that deleting FORMULA  from FORMULA 
(call the resulting graph FORMULA ) results in
the same MST less the edge FORMULA , i.e.,
that FORMULA .
This follows from considering the progress of Kruskal's algorithm
on the two graphs.
Before edge FORMULA  is added to FORMULA ,
the two processes progress identically:
every edge added to FORMULA  is also a cheapest edge
for the smaller graph FORMULA .
The edge FORMULA , added to FORMULA , of course has no parallel in FORMULA .
As further edges are considered in order of increasing cost,
again, every edge added to FORMULA  will also be added to FORMULA ,
using the fact that none of these edges is incident on FORMULA .
Thus, if FORMULA  is not a vertex of FORMULA , then FORMULA .
Since FORMULA  has at least two leaves,
it has at least one leaf FORMULA  not in FORMULA , unless FORMULA ,
which is impossible since FORMULA  has at least 3 vertices.
Outline of the paper
In Section  we define a “FORMULA -constructible” graph,
and show that
every graph FORMULA  is FORMULA -constructible,
and every FORMULA -constructible graph is a subgraph of some graph FORMULA .
This allows a simpler reformulation of Theorem REF 
as Theorem REF ,
which also generalizes a theorem of Mader {{cite:cb084b78-5493-4b1e-b30c-65430dbb2b28}}.
We prove Theorem REF  in Section .

FORMULA -constructible graphs
We begin by recalling Menger's theorem for undirected
graphs, which motivates our definition of FORMULA -constructible
graphs. Two vertices in an undirected graph are called
FORMULA -connected if there are FORMULA  (internally) vertex-disjoint paths
connecting them.
Theorem 3 (Menger's theorem) 
Let FORMULA  be two vertices in an undirected graph FORMULA  such that
FORMULA . Then FORMULA 
and FORMULA  are FORMULA -connected in FORMULA  if and only if after
deleting any FORMULA  vertices (distinct from FORMULA  and FORMULA ), FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are still connected.

Definition 4 (FORMULA -constructible graph) 
A graph FORMULA  is called FORMULA -constructible if there exists
an ordering FORMULA  of the edges in FORMULA 
such that for all FORMULA  the graph
FORMULA  contains at most FORMULA  vertex-disjoint paths
between the two endpoints of FORMULA . We say
that FORMULA  is a FORMULA -construction order for the graph FORMULA .

Note that 1-constructible graphs are forests, and
edge-maximal 1-constructible graphs are spanning trees. We therefore
have in particular that graphs of the form FORMULA 
(i.e., MSTs, recalling the FORMULA  is complete)
are edge-maximal 1-constructible graphs.
A slightly weaker statement
is true for all FORMULA :
every graph FORMULA  is FORMULA -constructible
(Theorem REF .REF ),
and every FORMULA -constructible graph is a subgraph of some graph FORMULA 
(Theorem REF .REF ).
Note that a stronger statement, that the graphs of the form FORMULA 
are exactly the edge-maximal FORMULA -constructible graphs, is not true.
To see this consider a cycle FORMULA  of length four. Assign weights
FORMULA  to these four edges (in arbitrary order) and weights FORMULA 
to the remaining edges of the complete graph on four vertices. It
is easily checked that FORMULA . But FORMULA  is not edge-maximal,
as a diagonal to the cycle FORMULA  can be added without destroying
2-constructibility.
Theorem 5

[i)]
For every complete graph FORMULA  with distinct
positive edge weights, FORMULA 
is FORMULA -constructible.

Let FORMULA  be FORMULA -constructible. Then there exist distinct
positive edge weights
for the complete graph
FORMULA  such that
FORMULA .
Part (REF ):
Let FORMULA  be a complete graph on FORMULA  vertices with
distinct positive edge weights.
Let FORMULA  be the
ordering of the edges in FORMULA  by increasing edge weights
and FORMULA  be
the ordering of the edges in FORMULA  by increasing edge
weights. We will now show that FORMULA  is a
FORMULA -construction order for FORMULA . Let
FORMULA . As FORMULA  there exists a
set FORMULA  with FORMULA  and
FORMULA , implying that the two endpoints
of FORMULA  are not connected in the graph
FORMULA .
By Menger's
theorem, this implies that there are at most FORMULA  vertex-disjoint paths
between the two endpoints of FORMULA 
in FORMULA . This statement remains
thus true for the subgraph
FORMULA .
The ordering FORMULA  is thus a FORMULA -construction order for FORMULA .
Part (REF ):
Conversely let FORMULA  be a FORMULA -constructible graph with
FORMULA -construction order FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be the complete graph on FORMULA .
We assign the following edge weights FORMULA  to the edges
in FORMULA . We assign the weight 1 to FORMULA , 2 to FORMULA 
and so on. The remaining edges FORMULA 
get arbitrary distinct weights greater than FORMULA . In order to show
that the graph FORMULA 
satisfies FORMULA  consider an arbitrary edge
FORMULA  and let FORMULA  with
FORMULA  be a vertex set separating the two endpoints of
FORMULA  in the graph FORMULA .
Applying Kruskal's algorithm to
FORMULA ,
the set of all edges considered before FORMULA  is contained
in FORMULA , leaving the endpoints of FORMULA  separated,
so FORMULA  will be accepted:
FORMULA .
We remark that the first part of the
foregoing proof shows an efficient construction of FORMULA :
follow a generalization of Kruskal's algorithm,
considering edges in order of increasing weight,
adding an edge if (prior to addition) its endpoints are
at most FORMULA -connected.
Connectivity can be tested as a flow condition, so that the algorithm runs
in polynomial time — far more efficient than the naive
FORMULA  protocol suggested by the definition
of FORMULA .
This again was already observed in {{cite:5b7ed92d-b736-4cc5-bf88-ba19d36cfa36}}.
By Theorem REF ,
the following theorem
is equivalent to Theorem REF .
Theorem 6 
For FORMULA , every FORMULA -constructible graph FORMULA 
with FORMULA  vertices satisfies
FORMULA 

Theorem REF  generalizes a result of
Mader {{cite:cb084b78-5493-4b1e-b30c-65430dbb2b28}},
based on results in {{cite:b34864fd-c885-473f-b32f-504872489634}}, concerning
“FORMULA -minimal” graphs
(edge-minimal FORMULA -connected graphs).
Every FORMULA -minimal graph is FORMULA -constructible, since
every order of its edges is a FORMULA -construction order.
The following theorem is thus a corollary of Theorem REF .
Theorem 7 (Mader's theorem)  
Every FORMULA -minimal graph with FORMULA  vertices
has at most FORMULA  edges.

Note that Mader's theorem (Theorem REF ) is
weaker than Theorem REF , because
while every FORMULA -minimal graph is FORMULA -constructible, the converse is false:
not every FORMULA -constructible graph is FORMULA -minimal.
An example with FORMULA  is a cycle FORMULA  with length four with an
additional diagonal FORMULA . The vertex set remains 2-connected even upon
deletion of the edge FORMULA , so the graph is not 2-minimal, but it
is 2-constructible (by any order where FORMULA  is not last).
Proof of the main theorem
In this section we prove Theorem REF .
We fix FORMULA  and prove the theorem by induction on FORMULA .
The theorem is trivially true for
FORMULA , so assume that FORMULA 
and that the theorem is true for all smaller values of FORMULA .
We prove (REF ) for a
FORMULA -constructible graph FORMULA  on FORMULA 
vertices and FORMULA  edges which, without loss of generality,
we may assume is edge-maximal
(no edges may be added to FORMULA  leaving it FORMULA -constructible).
Fix a FORMULA -construction order
FORMULA 

of FORMULA  and (for any FORMULA ) let
FORMULA .
Also fix a set
FORMULA  of size FORMULA  such that the two
endpoints of FORMULA  lie in two different components FORMULA  of FORMULA 
(the set FORMULA  exists by FORMULA -constructibility of FORMULA  and
Menger's theorem). The edge maximality of FORMULA 
implies that FORMULA  form a
partition of FORMULA . Let FORMULA  and FORMULA .
(If there were a third component FORMULA  then, even after adding FORMULA ,
any FORMULA  and FORMULA  are at most FORMULA -connected
and so the edge FORMULA  could be added,
contradicting maximality.)
Our goal is to define two graphs
FORMULA  and FORMULA  that satisfy
the following property.
Property 8

FORMULA  and FORMULA  are both FORMULA -constructible.

FORMULA  contains all edges of FORMULA .

FORMULA  contains all edges of FORMULA .

For every pair of vertices FORMULA  not connected by an edge in FORMULA , there is an
edge FORMULA  in either FORMULA  or in FORMULA  (but not both).
If we can find graphs FORMULA  and FORMULA 
satisfying Property REF , then
the proof can be finished as follows. Note that we have the
following equality:
FORMULA 
The term FORMULA  comes from the fact that FORMULA  covers
all edges of FORMULA  except FORMULA , the term FORMULA  represents the
double counting of edges contained in FORMULA , and the last term
counts the edges
which are covered by FORMULA  and FORMULA  but not in FORMULA .
We therefore have
FORMULA 
Applying the inductive hypothesis on FORMULA  and FORMULA 
(which by Property REF  are FORMULA -constructible)
we get the desired result:
FORMULA 

where in the second inequality we have used FORMULA .
We will finally concentrate on finding
FORMULA  and
FORMULA  satisfying Property REF .
Let FORMULA  be the set of all
anti-edges in FORMULA .
(FORMULA  denotes the set of unordered pairs of elements of FORMULA .)
For FORMULA , let FORMULA  be the smallest value of FORMULA 
such that FORMULA  and FORMULA  are FORMULA -connected in FORMULA .
(Considering FORMULA  vertex-disjoint paths between FORMULA  and FORMULA  in FORMULA ,
and noting that deletion of the single edge FORMULA  leaves them at least
FORMULA  connected, it follows that FORMULA  and FORMULA 
are precisely FORMULA -connected in FORMULA .)
Define FORMULA .
Since by edge maximality of FORMULA  every pair FORMULA 
is FORMULA -connected in FORMULA ,
it follows that FORMULA  form a partition of FORMULA .
Our basic strategy to define the graphs FORMULA  and FORMULA 
(and appropriate orderings of their edges
which prove that they are FORMULA -constructible) is as follows.
In a particular way,
we will partition each FORMULA  as FORMULA ,
and determine orders FORMULA  and FORMULA  on their respective edges.
Let FORMULA  be the graph constructed by the order
FORMULA 

where (recalling that FORMULA  has vertex set FORMULA )
we ignore any edge FORMULA .
(There is no issue with edges from FORMULA , as these
belong to FORMULA .)
Define FORMULA  symmetrically.
We need to show that the graphs FORMULA  and FORMULA  satisfy
Property REF ;
the central point will be to ensure that
FORMULA  is a FORMULA -construction order for FORMULA ,
and FORMULA  for FORMULA .
(By definition of the edges FORMULA , note that every edge FORMULA 
when added after FORMULA  in the order FORMULA  violates FORMULA -constructibility,
but in the following we show how FORMULA  can be
chosen such that it will not violate FORMULA -constructibility in FORMULA ;
likewise for edges FORMULA  and FORMULA .)
To show that FORMULA  and FORMULA  are FORMULA -construction orders
we need to check that, just before an edge is added,
its endpoints are at most FORMULA -connected.
To prove this, we distinguish between edges FORMULA  and edges FORMULA .
We first dispense with the easier case of an edge FORMULA .
Proposition REF  shows that
(for any orders FORMULA  of FORMULA )
in the edge sequence FORMULA ,
every edge FORMULA  has endpoints which are at most FORMULA -connected
upon its addition to the graph
FORMULA .
It follows that the endpoints are also at most FORMULA -connected
upon the edge's addition to FORMULA  (respectively, FORMULA ), i.e., in the graph
FORMULA ,
where as usual we disregard edges not in FORMULA .
Proposition 9 
Let FORMULA  and FORMULA 
such that FORMULA  is not an edge in FORMULA .
If the maximum number of vertex-disjoint paths between
FORMULA  and FORMULA  in FORMULA  is FORMULA , then the maximum
number of vertex-disjoint paths between FORMULA  and FORMULA  in
the graph
FORMULA  is FORMULA , too.

For any FORMULA  as above,
let FORMULA , FORMULA , be a set separating FORMULA  and
FORMULA  in FORMULA . As FORMULA , FORMULA  cannot separate
two FORMULA -connected vertices in FORMULA . This implies that any two
vertices in FORMULA  that are FORMULA -connected in FORMULA 
lie in the same connected component of  FORMULA. As
every edge in FORMULA  connects two vertices
that are FORMULA -connected in FORMULA , adding the
edges FORMULA  to  FORMULA
does not change the component structure of FORMULA . The
set FORMULA  thus remains a separating set for FORMULA  and FORMULA  in the graph
FORMULA ,
proving that FORMULA  and FORMULA  are at most FORMULA -connected in this graph.
Proposition  REF
With Proposition REF  addressing edges FORMULA ,
to ensure FORMULA -constructibility of FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
it suffices
to choose for FORMULA  and FORMULA  the
orders FORMULA  in such a way that successively
adding any edge FORMULA  to the graph FORMULA 
connects two vertices which were at most FORMULA -connected.
Let FORMULA  with FORMULA  a set separating the
endpoints of FORMULA  in the graph FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be the two components
of FORMULA  containing
the two endpoints of the edge FORMULA .
We define FORMULA , FORMULA .
Figure REF  illustrates these sets.

Propositions REF –REF .

The following proposition shows that the edges FORMULA  form a bipartite graph.
Proposition 10
FORMULA 

Suppose by way of contradiction that
FORMULA .
Let
FORMULA 

the edge order obtained by inserting FORMULA 
immediately before FORMULA  in the original order
FORMULA .
We will show that FORMULA  is a FORMULA -construction order, thus contradicting
the edge maximality of FORMULA .
For edges up to FORMULA  this is immediate from the fact that FORMULA 
is a FORMULA -construction order. Proposition REF 
shows that edges FORMULA  and later do not violate FORMULA -constructibility.
(Literally, Proposition REF  applies to the order
FORMULA 
rather than to FORMULA , but for edges FORMULA  and later the swap of
FORMULA  and FORMULA  is irrelevant.)
The edge FORMULA  itself does not violate FORMULA -constructibility,
since by the definition of FORMULA  its two endpoints are at most FORMULA 
connected in FORMULA .
This leaves only edge FORMULA  to check,
but since FORMULA ,
FORMULA  remains a separating set with cardinality FORMULA 
for the two endpoints of FORMULA  in the graph
FORMULA .
Thus FORMULA  is a FORMULA -construction order, giving the desired contradiction.
We will now describe a method for constructing the orders FORMULA , FORMULA .
Our approach is to define an order FORMULA 
on (a subset of) the vertices of FORMULA 
and to assign to every vertex
FORMULA  a label FORMULA .
The two orders FORMULA , FORMULA  are then defined as follows.
We begin with FORMULA  and add all edges in FORMULA 
which are incident to FORMULA  at the end of FORMULA  in any order.
In the next step all edges of FORMULA  which are incident to FORMULA  and
not already assigned to one of the orders FORMULA  are
added at the end of FORMULA  in any order.
This is repeated until all edges are assigned.
In what follows we show how to
choose a vertex order FORMULA  and labels FORMULA  so that
FORMULA  and FORMULA  are FORMULA -construction orders.
Just as FORMULA  and FORMULA  are built iteratively, so is FORMULA ,
starting with FORMULA .
For any FORMULA , we define FORMULA  to be the set of edges
in FORMULA  incident on vertices in FORMULA , i.e.,
FORMULA .
Proposition 11 
Let FORMULA  and FORMULA . We then
have that FORMULA  there
are at most FORMULA  vertex-disjoint paths
between the two endpoints of FORMULA  in the graph
FORMULA .

Observe that the set FORMULA  separates the two
endpoints of the edge FORMULA  in the graph
FORMULA . As this set has cardinality
FORMULA  the result follows by Menger's theorem.
Let FORMULA  be the set of vertices labeled 1 contained in the
partially constructed FORMULA , and FORMULA  those labeled 2.
If we can find a vertex FORMULA 
where the number of “new” edges incident on FORMULA  satisfies
FORMULA 
then by Proposition REF ,
adding FORMULA  at the end of the current order
FORMULA  and labeling it
FORMULA 
does not violate FORMULA -constructibility of the orders FORMULA 
and FORMULA .
The following proposition shows that, until the process is complete
(until FORMULA ), such a vertex FORMULA  can always be found.
Proposition 12 
Let FORMULA  be two disjoint sets.
If FORMULA ,
then there exists a vertex FORMULA 
that satisfies (REF ).

Note that FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA  are disjoint and contained in FORMULA , so
FORMULA 

where FORMULA  by definition. Also,
FORMULA 

>From the fact that the right side of (REF ) is equal to
FORMULA  minus that of (REF ), we get
FORMULA 

By disjointness of FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
FORMULA 

using (REF ) in the last inequality.
Thus, the smaller summand in (REF ) is at most the larger summand
in (), and without loss of generality we suppose that
FORMULA 
By the hypothesis FORMULA ,
there is an edge FORMULA ;
by Proposition REF , FORMULA 
with FORMULA  and FORMULA ;
and by definition of FORMULA ,
FORMULA ,
i.e., FORMULA 
and FORMULA .
Then FORMULA  satisfies (REF )
because the new edges on FORMULA  must go to so-far-unused vertices in FORMULA :
FORMULA 

whence (REF ) closes the argument.
Therefore there always exist two FORMULA -construction
orders FORMULA  as desired, which completes the proof of
Theorem REF .
