In the dense-neutrino region above the neutrino sphere of a supernova
(FORMULA  km), neutrino-neutrino refraction causes collective
flavor transformations. They can lead to “spectral splits” where an
energy FORMULA  splits the transformed spectrum sharply into
parts of almost pure but different flavors. Unless there is an
ordinary MSW resonance in the dense-neutrino region, FORMULA 
is determined by flavor-lepton number conservation alone. Spectral
splits are created by an adiabatic transition between regions of large
and small neutrino density. We solve the equations of motion in the
adiabatic limit explicitly and provide analytic expressions for a
generic example.

Introduction
At large densities, neutrino-neutrino refraction
causes nonlinear flavor oscillation phenomena with sometimes
perplexing results {{cite:814e42f4-c9e7-4017-99b1-969352802c34}}, {{cite:886f9098-5100-426a-b87d-cbb083bf5ae1}}, {{cite:01989a6f-7990-463d-9d13-1d4df74027af}}, {{cite:94d6be55-af7f-4371-84c9-c6b96561d0d6}}, {{cite:e7423384-b462-459c-83b9-5d15711e2b98}}, {{cite:129b7b11-3d13-4ae2-841b-1071f8fb16b4}}, {{cite:d2bf3cb9-c7aa-4c55-a3a7-1a003d6d2d03}}, {{cite:5ffcc702-f01c-4325-b096-cf7f42e407da}}, {{cite:99403161-8e3e-41d2-b040-30096db714b8}}, {{cite:e191c0f7-5182-4fd8-b1a3-3f954aaa74d8}}, {{cite:6696631f-fa10-485e-82c4-3a6c76c7b0ed}}, {{cite:9a42529f-f346-47d7-bd45-8a112e3faad8}}, {{cite:0f6e3997-e08f-4210-8a32-ddcf00c80fc8}}, {{cite:ccd8404e-8354-4815-aa87-5cfbee8f6975}}, {{cite:66e812f7-e9b8-4a2a-9a73-bb4670a600f4}}. In the region between the neutrino sphere and
a radius of about 400 km in core-collapse supernovae (SNe), the
neutrino flavor content evolves dramatically {{cite:d2bf3cb9-c7aa-4c55-a3a7-1a003d6d2d03}}, {{cite:5ffcc702-f01c-4325-b096-cf7f42e407da}}, {{cite:99403161-8e3e-41d2-b040-30096db714b8}}, {{cite:e191c0f7-5182-4fd8-b1a3-3f954aaa74d8}}, {{cite:6696631f-fa10-485e-82c4-3a6c76c7b0ed}}, {{cite:9a42529f-f346-47d7-bd45-8a112e3faad8}}, {{cite:0f6e3997-e08f-4210-8a32-ddcf00c80fc8}}. The global features of this self-induced
transformation are equivalent to the motion of a gyroscopic pendulum
in flavor space {{cite:6696631f-fa10-485e-82c4-3a6c76c7b0ed}}, {{cite:9a42529f-f346-47d7-bd45-8a112e3faad8}}. However, this
picture does not explain the “spectral splits” that have been
numerically observed in the transformed fluxes {{cite:99403161-8e3e-41d2-b040-30096db714b8}}, {{cite:e191c0f7-5182-4fd8-b1a3-3f954aaa74d8}}, {{cite:0f6e3997-e08f-4210-8a32-ddcf00c80fc8}}. In a typical case, the primary FORMULA 
flux below a split energy FORMULA  emerges from the
dense-neutrino region in its original flavor, whereas above FORMULA , it is completely transformed to FORMULA  (some mixture of
FORMULA  and FORMULA ), the step at FORMULA  being very
sharp. (To be specific we explore the FORMULA –FORMULA  system with the
atmospheric FORMULA  and the small 13-mixing angle.)
It has been suggested that an adiabatic transition from high to
low neutrino density is the primary cause for the
split {{cite:99403161-8e3e-41d2-b040-30096db714b8}}, {{cite:9a42529f-f346-47d7-bd45-8a112e3faad8}}. Dense neutrinos perform
synchronized oscillations: all modes oscillate with a common
frequency FORMULA , even though their individual
frequencies vary as FORMULA . Flavor oscillations
can be visualized as the precession of polarization vectors FORMULA  in a “flavor FORMULA  field.” The FORMULA 
“stick together” by the FORMULA –FORMULA –interaction, thus forming a
collective object that precesses around FORMULA . The collectivity
is lost when the neutrino density decreases. However, if the
decrease is slow, all FORMULA  align themselves with or
against FORMULA  in the process of decoupling from each other.
Eventually they all precess with their individual FORMULA  around
FORMULA , but without visible consequences because of their
(anti-)alignment with FORMULA .
We extend this interpretation of the split phenomenon in several
ways. We (i) show that flavor-lepton number conservation determines
FORMULA , (ii) solve the equations of motion explicitly in the
adiabatic limit, and (iii) provide an analytic result for a generic
case.

Equations of motion
We represent the flavor content of an
isotropic FORMULA –FORMULA  gas by flavor polarization vectors FORMULA  and FORMULA , where overbarred quantities
correspond to FORMULA . We define their global counterparts as
FORMULA  and FORMULA  and introduce FORMULA , representing the net lepton number. The
equations of motion (EOMs) are {{cite:6696631f-fa10-485e-82c4-3a6c76c7b0ed}}, {{cite:5ea07075-f319-4d0d-a198-6010496e4022}}
FORMULA 
and the same for FORMULA  with FORMULA . Here
FORMULA  represents the usual matter potential
and FORMULA  the FORMULA –FORMULA  interaction
strength, where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the electron and neutrino
densities. We work in the mass basis where FORMULA 
corresponds to the normal and FORMULA  to the inverted mass
hierarchies. The interaction direction FORMULA  is a unit vector such
that FORMULA  with FORMULA  being the vacuum
mixing angle. Unless there is an MSW resonance in the dense-neutrino
region, one can eliminate FORMULA  from Eq. (REF ) by
going into a rotating frame, at the expense of a small effective
mixing angle {{cite:5ffcc702-f01c-4325-b096-cf7f42e407da}}, {{cite:6696631f-fa10-485e-82c4-3a6c76c7b0ed}}. The only difference
for antineutrinos is that in vacuum they oscillate “the other way
round.” Therefore, instead of using FORMULA  we may
extend FORMULA  to negative frequencies such that FORMULA  (FORMULA ) and use only FORMULA  with FORMULA . In these terms, FORMULA , where
FORMULA .
After elimination of FORMULA , the EOM for FORMULA  can be
obtained by integrating Eq. (REF ) with FORMULA :
FORMULA 
It shows that FORMULA  so that FORMULA  is conserved {{cite:6696631f-fa10-485e-82c4-3a6c76c7b0ed}}. The
in-medium mixing angle above a SN core is small and therefore the
mass and interaction basis almost coincide. Collective effects then
only induce pair transformations of the form
FORMULA , whereas the excess FORMULA  flux
from deleptonization is conserved.

Adiabatic solution
We rewrite the EOMs in terms of an
“effective Hamiltonian” for the individual modes as
FORMULA 
In the adiabatic limit each FORMULA  moves slowly compared
to the precession of FORMULA  so that the latter follows the
former. We assume that initially all FORMULA  represent the
same flavor and thus are aligned. If initially FORMULA  is large, every
FORMULA  is practically aligned with FORMULA .
Therefore, in the adiabatic limit it stays aligned with FORMULA  for the entire evolution:
FORMULA 
which solves the EOMs. Here FORMULA  and
FORMULA  is a unit
vector. Here and henceforth we assume an excess flux of neutrinos over
antineutrinos, implying that initially FORMULA  and FORMULA 
are collinear and FORMULA .
According to Eq. (REF ) all FORMULA  lie in the
plane spanned by FORMULA  and FORMULA  which we call the
“co-rotating plane.” In the adiabatic limit all FORMULA ,
and consequently FORMULA , also stay in that plane.
Therefore we can decompose
FORMULA 
and rewrite the EOM of Eq. (REF ) as
FORMULA 
Therefore FORMULA  and the co-rotating plane precess around FORMULA  with the common or “co-rotation frequency” FORMULA .
We conclude that the system evolves simultaneously in two ways: a
fast precession around FORMULA  determined by FORMULA  and a drift in the co-rotating plane caused by
the explicit FORMULA  variation. To isolate the latter from the
former, we go (following Ref. {{cite:5ffcc702-f01c-4325-b096-cf7f42e407da}}) into the
co-rotating frame where the individual Hamiltonians become
FORMULA 
We use the same notation because the relevant components FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA  remain invariant.
Initially (FORMULA ) the oscillations are synchronized,
FORMULA , and all FORMULA 
form a collective FORMULA . As FORMULA  decreases, the FORMULA 
zenith angles spread out while remaining in a single co-rotating
plane. In the end (FORMULA ) the co-rotation frequency is
FORMULA  and Eqs. (REF ) and (REF )
imply that all final FORMULA  and therefore all FORMULA  with FORMULA  are aligned with FORMULA , the others anti-aligned: a spectral split is inevitable with
FORMULA  being the split
frequency. The lengths FORMULA  are conserved and
eventually all FORMULA  point in the FORMULA 
directions. Therefore the conservation of flavor-lepton number gives
us FORMULA , for FORMULA , by virtue of
FORMULA 
In general, FORMULA .
For individual modes the EOMs given by FORMULA  are
completely solved if we find FORMULA  and
FORMULA , the component transverse to FORMULA , since FORMULA 
is conserved and given by the initial condition. From
Eq. (REF ) we infer FORMULA , from Eq. (REF )
FORMULA  and FORMULA  so that
FORMULA 
Integration of the second equation over FORMULA  gives us
FORMULA 
Projecting Eq. (REF ) on the FORMULA –FORMULA –plane we find
FORMULA  or explicitly
FORMULA 
For large FORMULA  when the oscillations are synchronized, this agrees
with the usual expression for FORMULA 
{{cite:129b7b11-3d13-4ae2-841b-1071f8fb16b4}}, but it changes when the FORMULA 
spread out in the zenith direction. Inserting Eq. ()
into Eq. (REF ) we find
FORMULA 
Given FORMULA  and a spectrum FORMULA , we can determine FORMULA  and FORMULA  from Eqs. (REF ) and
(REF ) for any FORMULA . These equations solve the EOMs
explicitly in the adiabatic limit.
We have assumed that all FORMULA  are initially aligned.
One can relax this restriction and allow some FORMULA  to
have opposite orientation. If different species are emitted from a
SN core with equal luminosities but different average energies, the
spectra will cross over so that some range of modes is prepared,
say, as FORMULA  and another as FORMULA .

Neutrinos only
We illustrate the power of our new results
with a generic neutrino-only example (FORMULA ). The
spectrum is taken box like with FORMULA  for
FORMULA  and 0 otherwise. With FORMULA  being
conserved we find from Eq. (REF )
FORMULA 
In Fig. REF  we show FORMULA  for
51 individual modes. They start with the common value FORMULA . Later they spread and eventually split,
some of them approaching FORMULA  and the others FORMULA . Some modes first
move down and then turn around as FORMULA  changes. A few
modes do not reach FORMULA  because of imperfect adiabaticity.
For the box spectrum the integrals Eqs. (REF )
and (REF ) are easily performed and one can extract
FORMULA 
where FORMULA . For FORMULA  and FORMULA 
the limits of FORMULA  agree with Eq. (REF ) from
lepton-number conservation. For FORMULA  we obtain
FORMULA , representing the initial condition FORMULA ,
and for FORMULA  we find FORMULA .
With Eq. (REF ) these results provide analytic solutions for
the adiabatic FORMULA . We show examples in
Fig. REF  (bottom left) for comparison with
the numerical solution of the EOMs. The agreement is striking and
confirms the picture of adiabatic evolution in the co-rotating
plane. The agreement is poor for modes close to the split (FORMULA ) at low neutrino densities (FORMULA ) where the evolution becomes nonadiabatic.

Adiabaticity condition
The speed for the FORMULA 
evolution in the co-rotating plane is FORMULA , where
FORMULA , while FORMULA  precesses with speed FORMULA . The evolution is
adiabatic if the adiabaticity parameter FORMULA . With Eqs. (REF )
and () we find
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .
For our neutrino-only (FORMULA ) box
spectrum Eqs. (REF ) give
FORMULA  and
FORMULA .
For FORMULA  we obtain FORMULA  and FORMULA 
so that the last term in the numerator of Eq. (REF )
dominates: FORMULA . With FORMULA  decreasing, FORMULA 
increases and at FORMULA  when FORMULA ,
adiabaticity violation begins. For FORMULA  the denominator
of Eq. (REF ) gives the dependence FORMULA , and therefore the closer FORMULA 
to FORMULA  the stronger the adiabaticity violation.

Including antineutrinos.
As a second generic case we now add
antineutrinos. One important difference is that even a very small
initial misalignment between FORMULA  and FORMULA  is enough to
cause a strong effect. Consider a single energy mode for FORMULA  with
FORMULA  and one for FORMULA  with FORMULA  that are
initially aligned in the flavor direction, now taken very close to
the mass direction, and assume an inverted hierarchy. From the
dynamics of the flavor pendulum {{cite:6696631f-fa10-485e-82c4-3a6c76c7b0ed}}, {{cite:9a42529f-f346-47d7-bd45-8a112e3faad8}}
we know that in the end FORMULA  is antialigned with FORMULA , whereas FORMULA  retains a large transverse component because
FORMULA  is conserved: The system prepares itself for a
spectral split.
Assuming box spectra for both FORMULA  and FORMULA , we show the
initial and final FORMULA  in Fig. REF 
(right), for the inverted hierarchy, FORMULA , and
FORMULA . From Eq. (REF ) one infers FORMULA .
For FORMULA  this is FORMULA . Therefore, all modes have
negative frequencies in the co-rotating frame and tilt away from
FORMULA  (see also the numerical FORMULA  in
Fig. REF ). The final split frequency is
found from flavor lepton number conservation to be FORMULA , using
FORMULA  for FORMULA . With
FORMULA  we find FORMULA  in agreement with
Fig. REF . For FORMULA  we have FORMULA  so that the final split always occurs among the
neutrinos. According to Fig. REF  the split
starts when the vector D develops a significant transverse
component, and it proceeds efficiently in a region FORMULA .
The “wiggles” in the curves in the right panels of
Fig. REF  stem from the nutation of the flavor
pendulum {{cite:6696631f-fa10-485e-82c4-3a6c76c7b0ed}}, {{cite:9a42529f-f346-47d7-bd45-8a112e3faad8}}. We have chosen a
relatively fast FORMULA  evolution (FORMULA ),
implying poor adiabaticity, to avoid too many nutation periods on the
plot. For a very slow FORMULA  the nutations disappear and the
co-rotating frame removes the full global evolution of the system.

Discussion
We have studied the phenomenon of spectral
splits that is caused by neutrino-neutrino refraction in the SN
dense-neutrino region. We have carried previous explanations of this
novel effect {{cite:99403161-8e3e-41d2-b040-30096db714b8}}, {{cite:9a42529f-f346-47d7-bd45-8a112e3faad8}} to the point of
explicit solutions in the adiabatic limit.
A spectral split occurs when a neutrino ensemble is prepared such
that the common direction of the flavor polarization vectors
deviates from the mass direction. An adiabatic density decrease
turns all modes below a split energy FORMULA  into the mass direction, and the others in
the opposite direction. Remarkably, during this phase all modes
remain in a single rotating plane, even after losing full
synchronization. FORMULA  is determined by lepton number
conservation in the mass basis.
The spectral split is a generic feature of the adiabatic evolution
when the density changes from large to small values. It can appear
even in the absense of neutrino-neutrino interactions. Indeed, in the
usual MSW case the evolution to zero density transforms FORMULA  to
FORMULA  and FORMULA  to FORMULA  for all
energies. This corresponds to FORMULA . The
neutrino-neutrino interactions shift FORMULA  to non-zero
values.
A spectral split is caused in the SN neutrino (but not antineutrino)
flux by neutrino-neutrino interactions alone, especially during the
accretion phase when ordinary MSW resonances occur far outside the
dense-neutrino region. Later the matter profile may become so shallow
that the H-resonance moves into this region {{cite:99403161-8e3e-41d2-b040-30096db714b8}}, {{cite:e191c0f7-5182-4fd8-b1a3-3f954aaa74d8}}, {{cite:9a42529f-f346-47d7-bd45-8a112e3faad8}}. The simultaneous action of collective
effects and an ordinary MSW resonance may then cause spectral splits
for both neutrinos and antineutrinos, leading to a rich phenomenology,
perhaps modifying r-process nucleosynthesis {{cite:99403161-8e3e-41d2-b040-30096db714b8}}, {{cite:9a42529f-f346-47d7-bd45-8a112e3faad8}}. Of course, the fluxes will be further processed by
ordinary conversion in the SN envelope {{cite:251292aa-b0e7-4da2-9f62-ea70b3d5f823}}, {{cite:a7814efa-f41b-4c44-9e07-79024942c7dc}}, thus modifying observable signatures. Still,
observing spectral splits would provide a smoking gun signature both
for the relevant neutrino properties and, if it occurs among
antineutrinos at late times, for the occurrence of a shallow density
profile above the neutrino sphere.
The neutrino flux emitted by a SN is anisotropic so that
neutrinos on different trajectories experience different
neutrino-neutrino interaction histories {{cite:99403161-8e3e-41d2-b040-30096db714b8}}, {{cite:9a42529f-f346-47d7-bd45-8a112e3faad8}} that would be expected to cause kinematical flavor
decoherence of different angular modes {{cite:ccd8404e-8354-4815-aa87-5cfbee8f6975}}. A
numerical exploration reveals, however, that in a typical SN scenario
the deleptonization flux suppresses decoherence and the evolution is
almost identical to that of an isotropic
ensemble {{cite:66e812f7-e9b8-4a2a-9a73-bb4670a600f4}}. Our treatment of the spectral
evolution is apparently applicable in a realistic SN context.
Collective neutrino oscillation phenomena in a SN may well be
important for the explosion mechanism, r-process nucleosynthesis and
may provide detectable signatures in a high-statistics signal from the
next galactic SN. Building on previous ideas, our formalism gives a
simple, elegant and quantitative explanation of seemingly impenetrable
numerical results. Our approach provides the basis for developing a
quantitative understanding of realistic consequences of collective
neutrino oscillations for SN physics and observational signatures.
