We present the results of a muon-spin relaxation study of the
high-FORMULA  analogue material
CsFORMULA AgFFORMULA .
We find unambiguous evidence for magnetic order, intrinsic to the
material, below FORMULA  K.
The ratio of inter- to intraplane coupling is estimated to be
FORMULA , while fits of the temperature
dependence of the order parameter reveal a critical exponent
FORMULA , implying
an intermediate character between pure two- and three- dimensional
magnetism in the critical regime.
Above FORMULA  we observe
a signal characteristic of dipolar interactions due to
linear F–FORMULA –F bonds, allowing the muon stopping
sites in this compound to be characterized.

FIGURE 
Twenty years after its discovery, high-FORMULA 
superconductivity remains one of the most pressing problems in
condensed matter physics. High-FORMULA  cuprates share a layered
structure of [CuOFORMULA ] planes with strong antiferromagnetic (AFM)
interactions between FORMULA  3FORMULA  CuFORMULA  ions {{cite:38201b50-c273-4894-9a9d-9188601f08ef}}, {{cite:6bf5c64f-3ea8-411f-897d-1e593bc3e34e}}.
However, analogous
materials based upon 3FORMULA  transition metal systems
such as manganites {{cite:15340a9d-894f-4e9a-8f84-62dee4f2334d}}
and nickelates {{cite:e01d7683-dca2-4e57-8a84-8dbe27f387bc}} share neither the magnetic nor the superconducting
properties of the high-FORMULA  cuprates, leading to speculation that the
spin-FORMULA  character of CuFORMULA  is unique in this context.
A natural extension to this line of inquiry is to explore compounds
based on the 4FORMULA  analogue of CuFORMULA , namely FORMULA  4FORMULA 
AgFORMULA  {{cite:2c6d60bd-a552-4bea-9682-3f60639acf1e}};
this motivated the synthesis of the
layered fluoride CsFORMULA AgFFORMULA  which contains silver in the
unusual divalent oxidation state {{cite:9ed382c1-f71e-49fa-b948-64e2d5074c9d}}, {{cite:413dd7ad-bab4-475a-928e-621c676c062a}}.
This material possesses several structural similarities with the
superconducting parent compound LaFORMULA CuOFORMULA ; it is comprised of planes
of [AgFFORMULA ] instead of [CuOFORMULA ] separated by planes of [CsF]
instead of [LaO]
(Fig. REF ).
Magnetic measurements {{cite:413dd7ad-bab4-475a-928e-621c676c062a}} suggest that
in contrast to the antiferromagnetism
of LaFORMULA CuOFORMULA , CsFORMULA AgFFORMULA  is well modelled as a
two-dimensional (2D) Heisenberg ferromagnet
(described by the Hamiltonian
FORMULA )
with intralayer coupling FORMULA  K.
The observation of a magnetic transition below FORMULA  K with no spontaneous magnetization
in zero applied field (ZF) and a small saturation magnetization
(FORMULA  mT), suggests the existence of a weak, AFM
interlayer coupling.
This behavior is reminiscent of the 2D ferromagnet KFORMULA CuFFORMULA 
{{cite:d218c6d7-2b5a-4e9e-885b-cb463bb30db9}}, where ferromagnetic (FM) exchange results from orbital
ordering driven by a Jahn-Teller distortion
{{cite:9fe109ab-bd35-4e29-b5e4-477a8b3efbe4}}, {{cite:5589c0f6-39c2-4af3-8564-2717112ad1ad}}.
On this basis, it has been suggested that in CsFORMULA AgFFORMULA 
a staggered ordering of
FORMULA  and FORMULA  hole-containing orbitals on
the AgFORMULA  ions gives rise to the FM superexchange {{cite:413dd7ad-bab4-475a-928e-621c676c062a}}.
An alternative scenario has also been advanced on the
basis of density functional calculations in which a
FORMULA 
orbital interaction through the Ag–F–Ag bridges causes spin
polarization of the FORMULA  band {{cite:7e03718e-95d2-4138-87e5-b7f63c7e4f0f}}.
Although inelastic neutron scattering measurements have been carried
out on this
material {{cite:413dd7ad-bab4-475a-928e-621c676c062a}},
both Cs and Ag strongly
absorb neutrons,
resulting in limited resolution and a poor signal-to-noise ratio.
In contrast,
spin-polarized muons, which are very sensitive probes of local magnetic
fields, suffer no such impediments and, as we shall see, are ideally
suited to investigations of the magnetism in fluoride materials.
In this paper we present the results of a ZF muon-spin relaxation
(FORMULA SR) investigation of CsFORMULA AgFFORMULA . We are able to
confirm that the material is uniformly ordered throughout its bulk
below FORMULA  and show that the critical behavior associated
with the magnetic phase transition is intermediate in character between 2D and
3D.
In addition, strong coupling between the muon and FFORMULA  ions allows us to
characterise the muon stopping states in this compound.
ZF FORMULA SR measurements were
made on the MuSR instrument at the ISIS facility,
using an Oxford Instruments Variox FORMULA He cryostat.
In a FORMULA SR experiment spin-polarized
positive muons are stopped in a target sample, where the muon usually
occupies an interstitial position in the crystal.
The observed property in the experiment is the time evolution of the
muon spin polarization, the behavior of which depends on the
local magnetic field FORMULA  at the muon site {{cite:0db6d685-0a35-40f4-a611-4281b62f202a}}.
Polycrystalline CsFORMULA AgFFORMULA  was synthesised as previously
reported {{cite:413dd7ad-bab4-475a-928e-621c676c062a}}.
Due to its chemical reactivity, the sample was mounted under an Ar atmosphere
in a gold plated Ti sample holder with a cylindrical sample space of diameter
2.5 cm and depth 2 mm.
A 25 FORMULA m thick window was screw-clamped onto a gold o-ring on the
main body of the sample holder resulting in an airtight seal.
Example ZF FORMULA SR spectra measured on CsFORMULA AgFFORMULA  are shown
in Fig. REF (a). Below FORMULA  (Fig. REF (c))
we observe oscillations in the time dependence of the muon
polarization (the “asymmetry” FORMULA  {{cite:0db6d685-0a35-40f4-a611-4281b62f202a}}) which are
characteristic of a quasi-static local magnetic field at the
muon stopping site. This local field causes a coherent precession of the
spins of those muons for which a component of their spin polarization
lies perpendicular to this local field (expected to be 2/3 of the
total spin polarization for a powder sample).
The frequency of the oscillations is given by
FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the muon
gyromagnetic ratio (FORMULA  MHz TFORMULA ) and FORMULA 
is the average magnitude of the local magnetic field at the FORMULA th muon
site. Any fluctuation in magnitude of these local fields will
result in a relaxation of the oscillating signal {{cite:ae9ef403-6561-4ced-9612-bbffb57744b0}}, described by
relaxation rates FORMULA .
Maximum entropy analysis (inset, Fig. REF (c)) reveals two separate
frequencies in the spectra measured below FORMULA ,
corresponding to two magnetically inequivalent muon stopping sites in the
material. The precession frequencies, which are proportional to the internal
magnetic field experienced by the muon,
may be viewed as an effective order parameter
for these systems {{cite:0db6d685-0a35-40f4-a611-4281b62f202a}}.
In order to extract the temperature dependence of the frequencies,
the low temperature data were fitted to the function
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the amplitudes of the precession
signals and FORMULA  accounts for the contribution
from those muons with a spin component parallel to the local magnetic
field. The term FORMULA  reflects the
non-relaxing signal from those muons which stop in the sample holder
or cryostat tail.
FIGURE 
The ratio of the two precession frequencies was found to be
FORMULA  across the temperature range FORMULA  and this ratio was fixed in the fitting procedure.
The amplitudes FORMULA  were found to be constant across the
temperature range and were fixed at
values FORMULA %, FORMULA %
and FORMULA %. This shows that the probability of a muon
stopping in a site that gives rise to frequency FORMULA  is
approximately half that of a muon stopping in a site that corresponds
to FORMULA . We note also that FORMULA  is in excess of the expected
ratio of FORMULA .
The unambiguous assignment of amplitudes is made
difficult by the resolution limitations that a pulsed muon source places on the
measurement.
The initial muon pulse at ISIS has FWHM FORMULA  ns,
limiting the response for frequencies above
FORMULA  {{cite:0db6d685-0a35-40f4-a611-4281b62f202a}}.
We should expect, therefore, slightly
reduced amplitudes or increased relaxation (see below) for the
oscillating components in our spectra for which FORMULA  MHz.
The amplitudes of the oscillations are large enough, however, for us
to conclude that the
magnetic order in this material is an intrinsic property of the
bulk compound.
Moreover, above FORMULA  there is a complete recovery of the total
expected muon asymmetry. This observation, along with the constancy
of FORMULA  below FORMULA ,
leads us to believe that CsFORMULA AgFFORMULA  is completely
ordered throughout its bulk below FORMULA .
Fig. REF (a) shows the evolution of the precession
frequencies FORMULA , allowing us to investigate the
critical behavior associated with the phase transition.
From fits of FORMULA  to the form
FORMULA  for
FORMULA  K,
we estimate FORMULA  K and FORMULA .
In fact, good fits to FORMULA 
are achieved over the entire measured temperature range (that is,
no spin wave related contribution was evident at low temperatures), yielding
FORMULA  MHz and FORMULA  MHz corresponding
to local magnetic fields at the two muon sites of
FORMULA  mT and FORMULA  mT.
A value of FORMULA  is less than expected for three
dimensional models
(FORMULA  for 3D Heisenberg), but
larger than expected for 2D models (FORMULA  for 2D FORMULA 
or FORMULA  for
2D Ising) {{cite:0cef00d8-7516-4ba8-9afe-f89c51e3fa5d}}, {{cite:77bf7a44-0dcf-4d78-a6f8-7cc64caba98d}}. This suggests that in
the critical regime
the behavior is intermediate in character between 2D and 3D;
this contrasts with the magnetic properties
of KFORMULA CuFFORMULA  where FORMULA , typical of
a 3D system, is observed
in the reduced temperature region
FORMULA , with a crossover to more 2D-like behavior
at FORMULA ,
where FORMULA  {{cite:d8dbc6e2-c4b8-4c12-a979-f2c692db9d1a}}, {{cite:dc58237c-42f4-4a5d-95ff-a120c4fa8ea9}}, {{cite:d9563c6e-7dbb-4b1d-aee3-3a3ac791264d}}.
Our measurements probe the behavior of CsFORMULA AgFFORMULA 
for FORMULA , for which we do not observe any
crossover.
FIGURE 
A knowledge of FORMULA  and the intraplane coupling FORMULA , allows us to
estimate the interplane coupling FORMULA . Recent studies of
layered FORMULA  Heisenberg ferromagnets using the spin-rotation
invariant Green's function method {{cite:9f593e56-f456-4de7-a6eb-56c6c6fa4a06}}, show that
the interlayer coupling may be described by an empirical formula
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  and FORMULA . Substituting our value of
FORMULA  K and using FORMULA  K {{cite:413dd7ad-bab4-475a-928e-621c676c062a}},
we obtain FORMULA  K and FORMULA . The application of this procedure to KFORMULA CuFFORMULA 
(for which FORMULA  K and FORMULA  K
{{cite:d218c6d7-2b5a-4e9e-885b-cb463bb30db9}}) results in FORMULA  K and
FORMULA . This suggests that, although
highly anisotropic,
the interlayer coupling is stronger in CsFORMULA AgFFORMULA  than
in KFORMULA CuFFORMULA . This may account for the lack of
dimensional crossover in CsFORMULA AgFFORMULA  down to FORMULA .
Both transverse depolarization rates FORMULA  and FORMULA 
are seen to decrease with increasing temperature (Fig. REF (b))
except close to FORMULA  where they rapidly increase.
The large values of FORMULA  at low temperatures may reflect the reduced
frequency response of the signal due to the muon pulse width described
above.
The large upturn in the depolarization rate close to FORMULA ,
which
is also seen in the longitudinal
relaxation rate
FORMULA  (which is small and nearly constant except on approach
to FORMULA ), may be attributed to the onset of critical fluctuations
close to FORMULA . The component in the spectra with the
larger precession frequency FORMULA 
has the smaller depolarization rate FORMULA  at all
temperatures. These features provide further evidence for a magnetic phase
transition at FORMULA  K.
Above FORMULA  the character of the measured spectra changes
considerably (Fig.REF (a) and (b)) and we observe lower
frequency oscillations
characteristic of the dipole-dipole interaction of the muon
and the FORMULA F nucleus {{cite:53817291-26fa-4b9c-8fe4-6424c344869f}}.
The
AgFORMULA  electronic moments,
which dominate the spectra for FORMULA ,
are no longer ordered in the paramagnetic regime,
and fluctuate very rapidly
on the muon time scale. They are therefore motionally narrowed
from the spectra, leaving the muon sensitive to the quasistatic nuclear
magnetic moments. This interpretation is supported by FORMULA SR measurements
of KFORMULA CuFFORMULA  where similar behavior was observed {{cite:f2ff7d33-ace1-4b10-b71a-c99c174c1e2a}}.
In many materials containing
fluorine, the muon and two fluorine ions form a strong hydrogen
bond usually separated by approximately twice the FFORMULA  ionic
radius.
The linear F–FORMULA –F spin system consists of four distinct
energy levels with three allowed transitions between them
(inset, Fig. REF (b))
giving rise to the distinctive three-frequency oscillations observed.
The signal is described by a
polarization function {{cite:53817291-26fa-4b9c-8fe4-6424c344869f}}
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA .
The transition frequencies (shown in Fig. REF (b)) are given by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA ,
FORMULA  is the FORMULA F
nuclear gyromagnetic ratio and FORMULA  is the FORMULA –FORMULA F separation.
This function accounts for the observed frequencies very well, leading us to
conclude that the F–FORMULA –F bonds are highly linear.
A successful fit of our data required the multiplication of
FORMULA  by
an exponential function with a small relaxation rate FORMULA ,
crudely modelling fluctuations close to FORMULA . The addition
of a further exponential component FORMULA  was also
required in order to
account for those muon sites not strongly dipole coupled to fluorine nuclei.
The data were fitted
with the resulting relaxation function
FORMULA 
The frequency FORMULA  was found to be constant
at all measured temperatures, taking the value FORMULA  MHz,
which corresponds to a constant F–FORMULA  separation of 1.19(1) Å, typical
of linear bonds {{cite:53817291-26fa-4b9c-8fe4-6424c344869f}}.
The relaxation rates only vary
appreciably within 0.2 K of the magnetic transition, increasing as
FORMULA  is approached from above, probably due to the
onset of critical fluctuations. This provides further evidence for our
assignment of FORMULA  K.
Our determination of FORMULA  and observation of the linear
F–FORMULA –F signal allow us to identify candidate
muon sites in CsFORMULA AgFFORMULA . Although the magnetic structure of the
system is not known, magnetic measurements {{cite:413dd7ad-bab4-475a-928e-621c676c062a}} suggest
the existence of loosely coupled FM AgFORMULA  layers
arranged antiferromagnetically along the FORMULA -direction.
Dipole fields were calculated for such a candidate magnetic structure
with AgFORMULA  moments in the FORMULA  planes oriented
parallel (antiparallel) to the FORMULA  direction for FORMULA  (FORMULA ).
The calculation was limited to a sphere containing FORMULA  Ag ions with
localized moments of FORMULA  {{cite:413dd7ad-bab4-475a-928e-621c676c062a}}.
The above considerations suggest that the muon sites will be situated
midway between two FFORMULA  ions.
Two sets of candidate muon sites may be identified in the planes
containing the fluorine ions. Magnetic fields corresponding to
FORMULA  are found in the [CsF] planes (i.e. those with FORMULA  and FORMULA )
at the positions (1/4, 1/4, FORMULA ), (1/4, 3/4, FORMULA ),
(3/4, 1/4, FORMULA ) and (3/4, 3/4, FORMULA ).
Sites corresponding to the frequency FORMULA 
are more difficult to assign, but good candidates are found in the
[AgFFORMULA ] planes
(at FORMULA ) at positions (1/4, 1/2, FORMULA ),
(3/4, 1/2, FORMULA ), (1/4, 0, FORMULA ) and (3/4, 0, FORMULA ).
The candidate sites are shown in Fig. REF .
We note that there
are twice as many [CsF] planes in a unit
cell than there are [AgFFORMULA ] planes in agreement with our
observation that components with frequency FORMULA  occur with
twice the amplitude of those with FORMULA .
Such an assignment then implies that the presence of the muon distorts
the surrounding FFORMULA  ions
such that their separation is FORMULA  Å. This contrasts with
the in-plane F–F
separation in the unperturbed material of 4.55 Å ([CsF]
planes)
and FORMULA  Å ([AgFFORMULA ] planes) {{cite:413dd7ad-bab4-475a-928e-621c676c062a}}.
Thus the two adjacent FFORMULA  ions in the magnetic [AgFFORMULA ]
planes each shift by FORMULA  Å from their equilibrium
positions towards the FORMULA , demonstrating that the muon
introduces a non-negligible local distortion; however, the distortion
in the AgFORMULA  ion positions is expected to be much less significant.
In conclusion, we have shown unambiguous evidence for magnetic order
in CsFORMULA AgFFORMULA  with an exchange anisotropy of FORMULA 
and critical behavior intermediate in
character between 2D and 3D. The presence of coherent F–FORMULA –F
states allows a determination of candidate muon sites and an estimate
of the perturbation of the system caused by the muon probe.
This study demonstrates that FORMULA SR is an effective and useful
probe of the CsFORMULA AgFFORMULA  system. In order
to further explore this system as an analogue to the
high-FORMULA  materials it is desirable to perform investigations
of doped materials based on the CsFORMULA AgFFORMULA  parent compound.
