Introduction
The topic of three-body forces (3BFs) is as old as nuclear physics
{{cite:1303a52e-f200-40d9-b38a-ab7597f078b0}} and, based on meson exchanges, various
processes have been proposed in the past (for a review see
{{cite:3e724071-51e2-4714-af45-10da6443b566}}). Among them, the Fujita-Miyazawa force
{{cite:8d89de9b-cb7b-4f20-8049-401851edf971}} with an intermediate FORMULA  generated by the
exchange of two pions is most obvious and is implemented in all
modern 3BF models. However the nature of these 3BFs is still not
completely understood. In recent years there has been new progress
in understanding the form of nuclear forces, because of the
application of chiral perturbation theory (FORMULA PT)
{{cite:9159466e-4d5a-4ea3-9a4d-4927f0b1a984}}-{{cite:445ca630-d42f-4e45-a1f9-87e613c1aa78}}. From this
developments one can expect a more systematic understanding of the
form of two-body (2B) and 3B forces. However, FORMULA PT implies
a priori unknown constants, the low-energy constants,
which have to be determined from experimental data. The bound
states of few-nucleons seem to be an ideal laboratory to determine
3BF parameters, as the binding energies are sensitive to the 3B
interaction and they are expected to be governed by the low-energy
regime of nuclear physics {{cite:f58d5bc6-e62d-4b14-83ca-ee35e37993be}}, {{cite:a743be20-7d04-431b-9f58-accd2096c123}}.
Therefore, the understanding of nuclear few-body bound states is
an important contribution to the understanding of the 3BF. To this
aim and for their numerical investigations one requires reliable
methods leading to the solutions of the non-relativistic
Schrödinger equation.
In the past several solution methods have been developed and
applied to the four-body bound state problem by using realistic
nuclear potentials, the CRCGV {{cite:fb42dff1-99d7-4c66-bf4f-0eea84fdb94d}}, the SV
{{cite:2ed13fd8-9054-4983-bd0f-66ab6a68d73e}}, the HH {{cite:bc304fbb-397c-49d0-a1dc-262f9c556f53}}, the GFMC
{{cite:1dca8142-ac5c-4bfa-a5e5-c7f12c26beb0}}, the NCSM {{cite:8aab5799-309b-4ecd-b9fe-d78fd564cd24}}, EIHH
{{cite:21593fb1-f4ed-4862-bf07-50f10c929ff2}} and the Faddeev-Yakubovsky (FY)
{{cite:80c14398-efc2-4e25-8c15-83c2dcf920d8}}-{{cite:a7ec095c-fa4a-40fb-8891-1b4e53eb4d13}}. These
calculational schemes are mostly based on a partial wave (PW)
decomposition. Stochastic and Monte Carlo methods, however, are
performed directly using position vectors in configuration space.
One of the most viable approaches appears to be the FY method. The
calculations based on FY are performed after a PW expansion with
phenomenological potentials in configuration space
{{cite:80c14398-efc2-4e25-8c15-83c2dcf920d8}}, {{cite:38cb4974-a657-438d-bfe1-65cf3a27a0cb}}, and in momentum space
{{cite:7d2b60d0-c833-46b2-ac18-54f31f99b9e6}}-{{cite:2cf203ce-8638-427c-870d-20e58c877d07}} and recently with chiral
potentials in momentum space
{{cite:d7e9cf4c-424a-4a62-87c9-dce0a4b0c440}}-{{cite:a7ec095c-fa4a-40fb-8891-1b4e53eb4d13}}.
The FY scheme based on a PW decomposition, which includes spin and
isospin degrees of freedom, after truncation leads to two coupled
sets of a finite number of coupled equations in three variables
for the amplitudes. In PW decomposition the number of channels
that must be included grows very rapidly in this case, and a
further complication is arisen where there are now six spatial
dimensions rather than the three required for three-body
calculations. So in a PW decomposition one needs a tremendous
number of partial waves to find converged results. In view of this
very large number of interfering terms it appears natural to give
up such an expansion and work directly with vector variables.
On this basis recently we have extended the Three-Dimensional (3D)
approach, which greatly simplifies the two- and three-body
scattering and bound state calculations without using PW
decomposition {{cite:183298de-4a7b-4642-a5b1-affbd7b45fff}}-{{cite:71c5ac3f-8c34-4539-a1d6-94cdba84381a}}, to the
four-body bound state {{cite:6f8609a9-2079-4874-adb7-fb781cfb0095}}, {{cite:71812d4e-88c8-4b14-b901-cadff09fd890}}. We have
formulated the Yakubovsky equations with only 2BFs as function of
vector Jacobi momenta, specifically the magnitudes of the momenta
and the angles between them. We have obtained two coupled
three-dimensional integral equations in six variables for the
amplitudes which greatly simplifies the calculations without using
PW decomposition. The obtained three-dimensional integral
equations have been solved successfully for simple NN force
models. In this paper we follow the same approach and consider the
3BFs in four-body bound state problem. As a simplification we
neglect spin and isospin degrees of freedom and study the
four-boson bound state problem.
So the purpose of this work is to demonstrate that one can solve
the Yakubovsky equations for four-body bound state without using
PW decomposition and in the first attempt we have done it by using
very simple 2B and 3B model interactions.
In our formulation we work directly with vector variables in the
Yakubovsky scheme in momentum space. Here the dependence on
momentum vectors shows that our 3D representation in comparison to
traditional PW representation avoids the very involved angular
momentum algebra occurring for the permutations and especially for
the 3BFs and the full solution can be reached exactly and simply
whereas the PW representation of the amplitudes leads to rather
complicated expressions {{cite:d0111b16-b080-4851-853c-0feb56eacf57}}.
We believe that this work is another step forward in the
development of 3D approach for studying the few-body systems and
it is the first attempt towards the solution of the 4N bound state
problem with the inclusion of 3NFs without performing the PW
decomposition.
This paper is organized as follows. In section 
we briefly represent the coupled Yakubovsky equations for
four-body bound state with two- and three-body interactions. In
section  we evaluate the matrix elements of
3BFs. In section  we discuss our
choice for independent variables for the unknown amplitudes in the
equations and in their kernels. Section  describes details of our algorithm for solving coupled
Yakubovsky three-dimensional integral equations. In section
 we present our results for three-
and four-body binding energies with and without model 3BFs and we
provide the test of our calculation. Finally we summarize in
section  and provide an outlook.

Momentum Space Representation of Yakubovsky Equations with 3BFs
The bound state of the four-body (4B) system, in the presence of
3BFs, is described by two coupled Yakubovsky equations
{{cite:2cf203ce-8638-427c-870d-20e58c877d07}}:
FORMULA 
where the Yakubovsky components FORMULA  and
FORMULA  belong to FORMULA  and FORMULA  partitions of the four particles respectively. Here
the free four-body propagator is given by FORMULA ,
and FORMULA  stands for the free Hamiltonian. The operator FORMULA  is
the two-body transition matrix determined by a two-body
Lippman-Schwinger equation. FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  are
permutation operators. FORMULA  permutes the
particles in three-body subsystem (123) and
FORMULA  interchanges the two two-body subclusters
(12) and (34). The quantity FORMULA , as shown in
Fig. REF , defines a part of the 3BF in the cluster
FORMULA , which is symmetric under the exchange of particles 1
and 2 and which can be related by an interchange of the three
particles to two other parts FORMULA  and FORMULA 
that sum up to the total 3BF of particles 1, 2 and 3:
FORMULA . The total 4B
wave function FORMULA  is given as:
FORMULA 
FIGURE 
FIGURE 
The symmetry property of FORMULA  under exchange of
particles 1 and 2, and FORMULA  under separate
exchanges of particles FORMULA  and FORMULA  guarantee that
FORMULA  is totally symmetric. It can easily be verified
that the inclusion of the 3BF component FORMULA  into the
definition of the first Yakubovsky component FORMULA 
does not change its symmetry property.
In this paper we follow the notation introduced in Ref.
{{cite:71812d4e-88c8-4b14-b901-cadff09fd890}} and work in a 3D momentum space basis.
According to the two types of chains FORMULA  and FORMULA 
there are two type of basis states, Fig. REF ,
which are suitable to represent the two Yakubovsky components
FORMULA  and FORMULA  in the coupled equations
(REF ). The representation of coupled equations
(REF ) in these basis sates will be exactly the same as
displayed in Ref. {{cite:71812d4e-88c8-4b14-b901-cadff09fd890}} except that an extra term
with FORMULA  occurs in the first component. This is
FORMULA 
where FORMULA . The
first matrix element can be handled as described in Ref.
{{cite:71812d4e-88c8-4b14-b901-cadff09fd890}}. The second matrix element involves the
3BF, which has been worked out in Ref. {{cite:d4bb1d69-19f6-48e2-8e35-3f49df433a65}} in a 3D
momentum space basis for three-body system. After evaluating the
first matrix element in Eq. (REF ), the coupled three
dimensional Yakubovsky integral equations can be rewrite
explicitly as:
FORMULA 
where the FORMULA  and FORMULA  are
symmetrized two-body FORMULA -matrices with the two-body subsystem
energies FORMULA  and
FORMULA . The
matrix elements of the 3BF term,
FORMULA , are evaluated in the next section.

The Evaluation of 3BF Matrix Elements in a 3D Approach
Each part of a 3BF with two scalar meson exchanges and a constant
meson-nucleon amplitude, which is shown in Fig. REF , can
be written in the following form
FORMULA 
with a cutoff function
FORMULA 
and momentum transfers FORMULA  and  FORMULA
FORMULA 
where the multiple indices for each curly bracket denote the
two-body followed by the FORMULA  fragmentation.
For the evaluation of Eq. (REF ) matrix elements of the
form
FORMULA  need to be calculated. From Fig. REF  we
see that FORMULA  can be considered as a sequence of meson
exchanges in the subsystem (23), where it is called for
convenience subsystem 1, and subsystem (31), is called 2. Since
the structure of the 3BF we consider is specified by two momentum
transfers of consecutive meson exchanges, it is convenient to
insert a complete set of states of the type 2 between
FORMULA  and FORMULA  and another complete set of
states of type 1 between the two meson exchanges. Then the
matrix element of FORMULA  is rewritten as
FORMULA 
Here the subscripts FORMULA  of the bra and ket vectors and in
integrals stand for the different types of three-body coordinate
systems of FORMULA -type fragmentation FORMULA . Both
meson-exchange propagators in the 3BF term only depend on the
momentum transfer in a two-body subsystem, as indicated in
Eq. (REF ), i.e.
FORMULA 
Using Eq. (REF ), one can rewrite Eq. (REF ) as:
FORMULA 
We would like to point out that in our vector based method the
calculation of the transformations from one three-body subsystem to
another, i.e. FORMULA  and FORMULA , are efficiently five-dimensional interpolations, whereas in
calculation of the coordinate transformations via a PW
decomposition, there is a complicated angular momentum recoupling
algebra involved.
Also we would like to mention that we do not follow the explicit
evaluation of the coordinate transformations in Eq. (REF )
leading to expressions with meson propagators which contain linear
combinations of three or four momentum vectors. Thus direct
integrations for evaluating the matrix element of the 3BF would
involve magnitudes of momentum vectors and angles between all of
them, which can be very complicated and involved. We therefore
follow the method proposed in Ref. {{cite:d4bb1d69-19f6-48e2-8e35-3f49df433a65}} and do not
carry out the coordinate transformation analytically, we evaluate
the integration of Eq. (REF ) in separate steps where in
each step we only integrate over one vector variable at a time.
Thus we define an auxiliary function
FORMULA 
the integration of the meson exchange between particles 2 and 3 in
Eq. (REF ) is carried out completely in the coordinate
system of type 2. Once
FORMULA  is
obtained, it needs to be expressed in terms of momenta in a
coordinate system of type 1 in order to carry out the integration
over the remaining meson exchange. This transformation, labeled
FORMULA  is
explicitly given as
FORMULA 
Here we used that
FORMULA  is a
scalar function due to the total wave function
FORMULA  being a scalar in
the ground state. In our vector based method, this transformation
is effectively a five dimensional interpolation on FORMULA  in
Eq. (REF ), which can be handled by the cubic Hermitian
splines of Ref. {{cite:5c60334c-7664-433b-a512-d5e50f9fc7f5}}. The integration over the
second meson exchange between particle 3 and 1 in the
coordinate system of type 1 is now given by
FORMULA 
The matrix element
FORMULA  is finally obtained by integrating
FORMULA  over
FORMULA  and FORMULA , i.e.
carrying out the final coordinate transformation from the system
of type 1 back to the one of type 3,
FORMULA 

Choosing The Coordinate Systems
In order to solve the coupled three dimensional Yakubovsky integral
equations, Eq. (REF ), directly without employing PW
projection, we have to define suitable coordinate systems. The
Yakubovsky components are given as a function of Jacobi momenta
vectors and as a solution of integral equations. Since we ignore
spin and isospin dependencies, the both Yakubovsky components are
scalars and thus only depend on the magnitudes of Jacobi momenta and
the angles between them. The first important step for an explicit
calculation is the selection of independent variables. As indicated
in Ref. {{cite:d4bb1d69-19f6-48e2-8e35-3f49df433a65}} one needs six variables to uniquely specify
the geometry of the three vectors. The coupled three dimensional
Yakubovsky integral equations, Eq. (REF ), with only 2BFs was
solved successfully in Ref. {{cite:71812d4e-88c8-4b14-b901-cadff09fd890}}. For the
evaluation of the 3BF term in the first Yakubovsky component in
Eq. (REF ),
FORMULA , we start with calculating first
FORMULA ,
Eq. (REF ), and realize that for this integration we can
choose FORMULA  parallel to the FORMULA -axis and
FORMULA  in the FORMULA  plane. This leads to the
simplification of the azimuthal angles. The explicit expression is
FORMULA 
with
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
Similarly for the integration over the second meson exchange, i.e.,
the evaluation of
FORMULA  of
Eq. (REF ), we can choose FORMULA  parallel to the
FORMULA -axis and FORMULA  in the FORMULA  plane. This leads to the
explicit expression which is functionally the same as
Eq. (REF ):
FORMULA 
with the same variables as Eq. (REF ) with FORMULA  FORMULA  instead of FORMULA  FORMULA .
The evaluation of
FORMULA ,
Eq. (REF ), is not an integration but rather a five
dimensional interpolation and explicitly is given by
FORMULA 
with
FORMULA 
Finally, the matrix element
FORMULA  is explicitly obtained by a five dimensional
interpolation as
FORMULA 
with
FORMULA 
The last term of first Yakubovsky component in Eq. (REF )
requires an additional integration of the matrix element
FORMULA  and the fully off-shell two-body FORMULA -matrix. Again,
with choosing FORMULA  parallel to the FORMULA -axis we only have
four vectors to consider, FORMULA 
and FORMULA , thus the integration is of a similar type as
the one of the first three terms of first Yakubovsky component in
Eq. (REF ),
FORMULA 
with
FORMULA 
These considerations lead to the explicit representation for the
Yakubovsky components FORMULA  and FORMULA :
FORMULA 
The coupled equations, Eq. (REF ), is the starting point
for numerical calculations and the details will be described in
the next section. The 3D representation of total wave function
FORMULA  which directly appears in Eqs. (REF ) and
(REF ) is represented in Ref. {{cite:71812d4e-88c8-4b14-b901-cadff09fd890}}, where
we have presented it as function of vector Jacobi momenta.
In a standard PW representation Eq. (REF ) is replaced by
two coupled sets of a finite number of coupled integral equations
{{cite:2f5ba882-3e8a-4bf7-9c60-17ef5da5b570}}, where the evaluation of two-body
FORMULA matrices and permutation operators FORMULA  and FORMULA 
as well as coordinate transformations due to considering angular
momentum quantum numbers instead of angle variables leads to more
complicated expressions in comparison to our 3D representation.

Numerical Techniques
In this section we describe some details of the numerical
algorithm for solving the coupled Yakubovsky three dimensional
integral equations, and more details can be found in Ref.
{{cite:71812d4e-88c8-4b14-b901-cadff09fd890}}. The Yakubovsky components are given as a
function of Jacobi momenta vectors and as a solution of coupled
three dimensional integral equations, Eq. (REF ). The both
Yakubovsky components are scalars and thus only depend on the
magnitudes of Jacobi momenta and the angles between them. The
dependence on the continuous momentum and angle variables should
be replaced in the numerical treatment by a dependence on certain
discrete values. For this purpose we use the Gaussian quadrature
grid points. The coupled Yakubovsky equations represent a set of
three dimensional homogenous integral equations, which after
discreatization turns into a huge matrix eigenvalue equation. The
huge matrix eigenvalue equation requires an iterative solution
method. We use a Lanczos-like scheme that is proved to be very
efficient for nuclear few-body problems {{cite:21a75028-a854-4b68-8fb9-666ecdd35870}}. The
momentum variables have to cover the interval FORMULA . In
practice we limit the intervals to suitable cut-offs and their
values are chosen large enough to achieve cut-off independence.
The functional behavior of the kernel of eigenvalue equation is
determined by the two-body FORMULA matrices. We also solve the
Lippman-Schwinger equation for the fully-off-shell two-body
FORMULA matrices directly as function of the Jacobi vector variables
{{cite:183298de-4a7b-4642-a5b1-affbd7b45fff}}. Since the coupled integral equations require
a very large number of interpolations, we use the cubic Hermitian
splines of Ref. {{cite:5c60334c-7664-433b-a512-d5e50f9fc7f5}} for its accuracy and high
computational speed. It should be mentioned that by adding the
additional grid points, 0 to all momentum and FORMULA  to all
angle grid points, we avoid the extrapolation outside the Gaussian
grids.

Numerical Results
Three- and Four-Body Binding Energies
In our calculations for 2BF we employ the spin-averaged
Malfliet-Tjon V potential {{cite:8d66c95d-83ac-4695-9e46-1e55e7143721}}. This force is a
superposition of a short-ranged repulsive and long-ranged
attractive Yukawa interactions. We use the same parameters as
given in Ref. {{cite:71812d4e-88c8-4b14-b901-cadff09fd890}} where the nucleon mass is
defined by FORMULA . With this interaction we solve the Lippman-Schwinger
equation for the fully-off-shell two-body FORMULA matrices directly as
function of the Jacobi vector variables as described in Ref.
{{cite:183298de-4a7b-4642-a5b1-affbd7b45fff}}. The so obtained FORMULA matrices are then
symmetrized to get FORMULA 
and FORMULA .
TABLE 
TABLE 
For four-body (three-body) binding energy calculations thirty
(forty) grid points for Jacobi momentum variables and twenty
(thirty two) grid points for angle variables have been used
respectively. As demonstrated in tables REF  and
REF , the calculations of the three- and four-body binding
energies using only the MT-V 2BF yield the values FORMULA  and
FORMULA , Ref. {{cite:71812d4e-88c8-4b14-b901-cadff09fd890}}.
In our calculations for 3BF we use a model of 3BF which is based
on multi-meson exchanges. We study two different types of 3BFs, a
purely attractive and a superposition of attractive and repulsive,
which are named MT3-I and MT3-II respectively Ref.
{{cite:d4bb1d69-19f6-48e2-8e35-3f49df433a65}}. As shown in Ref. {{cite:d4bb1d69-19f6-48e2-8e35-3f49df433a65}} The parameters
of these 3BFs are chosen so that the correction due to these 3BFs
to the three-body binding energy calculated with the modified
Malfliet-Tjon 2BF (MT2-II) is small, and they lead to binding
energies near to the triton binding energy.
The three- and four-body binding energies calculated in 3D
approach are given in tables REF  and REF . Our
results for three-body binding energies with the addition of the
MT3-I and MT3-II 3BFs, while MT-V is used as 2BF, are FORMULA  and
FORMULA  [MeV] and while MT2-II is used as 2BF are FORMULA  and
FORMULA  respectively. Our results agree with corresponding values
presented in Ref. {{cite:d4bb1d69-19f6-48e2-8e35-3f49df433a65}} and {{cite:3b588152-dc78-4c75-8f6b-d386b088f9b1}}. Our
results for four-body binding energies with the addition of the
MT3-I and MT3-II 3BFs, while MT-V is used as 2BF, are FORMULA  and
FORMULA  [MeV] respectively. Unfortunately we could not compare our
results for four-body binding energies with other calculations,
since to the best of our knowledge no comparable work with scalar
two-meson exchange 3BFs exists. So in order to test the accuracy
of our calculations we carried out two numerical tests which are
presented in next section.
According to our experience for four-body bound state calculations
with 2BF alone {{cite:71812d4e-88c8-4b14-b901-cadff09fd890}}, we expect that our results
with 3BF provide the same accuracy in comparison to other
calculations of the four-body binding energy based on PW
decomposition, while the numerical procedure are actually easier
to implement.

Test of Calculations
In this section we investigate the numerical stability of our
algorithm and our 3D representation of Yakubovsky components. We
specially investigate the stability of the eigenvalue of the
Yakubovsky kernel with respect to the number of grid points for
Jacobi momenta, polar and azimuthal angle variables. We also
investigate the quality of our representation of the Yakubovsky
components and consequently wave function by calculating the
expectation value of the Hamiltonian operator.
In table REF  we present the obtained eigenvalue results
for binding energies given in tables REF  and REF 
for different grids. We choose the number of grid points for
Jacobi momenta as FORMULA , for spherical angles as FORMULA  and
for polar angles as FORMULA . As demonstrated in this table, the
calculation of the eigenvalues FORMULA  convergence to the value
one for FORMULA  and FORMULA . It should be clear
that the solution of coupled Yakubovsky three-dimensional integral
equations, with six independent variables for the amplitudes, is
much more time-consuming with respect to the solution of
three-dimensional Faddeev integral equation {{cite:d4bb1d69-19f6-48e2-8e35-3f49df433a65}}, with
three variables for the amplitude.
TABLE 
The solution of coupled Yakubovsky three-dimensional integral
equations in momentum space allows to estimate numerical errors
reliably. With the binding energy FORMULA  and the Yakubovsky
components FORMULA  and FORMULA  available,
we are able to calculate the total wave function FORMULA 
from Eq. (REF ) by considering the choice of coordinate
systems which are represented in Ref. {{cite:71812d4e-88c8-4b14-b901-cadff09fd890}}. So
in order to demonstrate the reliability of our calculations we can
evaluate the expectation value of the Hamiltonian operator FORMULA  and
compare this value to the previously calculated binding energy of
the eigenvalue equation, Eq. (REF ). Explicitly we evaluate
the following expression:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  represents the 2BFs FORMULA  and FORMULA  the 3BFs
FORMULA . The expectation value of the kinetic
energy FORMULA  and the 2B potential energy FORMULA  have been evaluated in Ref. {{cite:71812d4e-88c8-4b14-b901-cadff09fd890}}.
The expectation value of the 3B potential energy, FORMULA , is given by
FORMULA 
Here the integrations need the evaluation of the matrix element
FORMULA  of Eq. (REF ). The expectation values of the
kinetic energy FORMULA , the 2B interaction FORMULA , the 3B interaction FORMULA  and the Hamiltonian
operator FORMULA  for three- and four-body bound states
are given in tables REF  and REF  respectively. In
the same tables the corresponding binding energies calculated in 3D
scheme are also shown for comparison to the expectation values of
the Hamiltonian operator. One can see that the energy expectation
value and eigenvalues FORMULA  agree with high accuracy. All these
numbers are not meant to provide insight into the physics of three
and four interacting nucleons, but serve only as a demonstration
that this technique allows a very accurate and easy handling of
typical nuclear forces consisting of attractive and repulsive (short
range) parts. In addition, they will serve as benchmarks for future
studies.
TABLE 
TABLE 
3BF effects have a stronger impact on four-body bound state than for
three-body bound state as can be seen for instance by comparing
expectation values of the potential energies for the two systems. We
find in case of MT-V FORMULA  (FORMULA ) MeV for
three (four)-body bound state without 3BF and FORMULA  (FORMULA ) MeV with MT3-I and
MT3-II 3BFs correspondingly. In the latter case the expectation
values for the 3BFs are FORMULA  (FORMULA ) MeV for three (four)-body bound state. Already the trivial
fact that there are four triplets in four-body bound state makes it
clear that one has to expect 3BF effects to be more pronounced in
the four-body bound state than in the three-body bound state.

Summary and Outlook
Instead of solving the coupled Faddeev-Yakubovsky equations in a
partial wave basis, we introduce an alternative approach for
four-body bound state calculations which implement directly
momentum vector variables. We formulated the coupled Yakubovsky
equations for identical spinless particles, interacting by two-
and three-body forces, as function of vector Jacobi momenta,
specifically the magnitudes of the momenta and the angles between
them. We expect that coupled three-dimensional Yakubovsky
equations for a bound state can be handled in a straightforward
and numerically reliable fashion. In comparison to an angular
momentum decomposition which is commonly used
{{cite:7d2b60d0-c833-46b2-ac18-54f31f99b9e6}}-{{cite:a7ec095c-fa4a-40fb-8891-1b4e53eb4d13}}, this direct approach
has great advantages. In our Three-Dimensional case there is only
two coupled three-dimensional integral equations to be solved,
whereas in the partial wave case one has two coupled sets of a
finite number of coupled equations with kernels containing
relatively complicated geometrical expressions. The comparison of
3D and PW formalisms shows that our 3D formalism avoids the very
involved angular momentum algebra occurring for the permutations
and transformations and it is more efficient especially for the
three-body forces.
The three dimensional Yakubovsky integral equations was
successfully solved using Malfliet-Tjon type 2BF alone, and its
numerical feasibility and accuracy established
{{cite:71812d4e-88c8-4b14-b901-cadff09fd890}}. Here we present results including the
scalar two-meson exchange three-body force and study its effects
on the energy eigenvalue and the four-body wave function. The
stability of our algorithm and our Three-Dimensional
representation of Yakubovsky components have been achieved with
the calculation of the eigenvalue of Yakubovsky kernel, where
different number of grid pints for Jacobi momenta and angle
variables have been used. Also we have calculated the expectation
value of the Hamiltonian operator. This test of calculation
represents good agreement between the obtained eigenvalue energy
and expectation value of the Hamiltonian operator.
This is very promising and nourishes our hope that calculations
with realistic two and three-nucleon forces, namely considering
spin and isospin degrees of freedom, will most likely be more
easily implemented than the traditional partial wave based method.
To this aim the first step for realistic calculations of
three-nucleon bound state in a realistic Three-Dimensional
approach has already been taken by calculation of Triton binding
energy with Bonn-B potential {{cite:f5b1ac5c-26df-4360-b50f-dff2792c3aac}}, {{cite:12d48940-50cf-471f-a131-ac1a32b02fce}} and
formulation of four-nucleon bound state is currently underway and
it will be reported elsewhere {{cite:db7cdeb6-e6dd-4372-9d81-75661e7cd28a}}.
They will be the first steps for realistic calculations of three-
and four-nucleon bound states in a Three-Dimensional scheme.
It should be mentioned that the input to such calculations is the
NN FORMULA -matrix which is calculated in an approach based on a
helicity representation and depends on the magnitudes of the
initial and final momenta and the angle between them
{{cite:c7aa6d91-f585-4c03-89be-a5dd9e3170c7}}. Consequently the calculation of NN
FORMULA -matrix in helicity representation needs the NN potentials in
an operator form which can be incorporated in 3D formalism. As
indicated in sec. FORMULA  of Ref. {{cite:13146f68-a6a6-4532-8311-b95c0b20dcac}} (or sec. III
of Ref. {{cite:c7aa6d91-f585-4c03-89be-a5dd9e3170c7}}) the general structure of the NN
potential operator which fits well to the helicity representation
is given, and on this representation both Bonn-B and AV18 NN
potentials are given in operator form, see appendixes C and D (or
sec. IV of Ref. {{cite:c7aa6d91-f585-4c03-89be-a5dd9e3170c7}}).
