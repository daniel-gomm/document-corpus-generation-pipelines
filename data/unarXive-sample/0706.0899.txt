We present sensitive phase-referenced VLBI results on the radio continuum
emission from the FORMULA  QSO BRI 1335–0417. The observations were carried
out at 1.4 GHz using the High Sensitivity Array (HSA).
Our sensitive VLBI image at FORMULA  mas (FORMULA  kpc)
resolution shows continuum emission in BRI 1335–0417 with a total flux
density of FORMULA Jy, consistent with the flux density measured
with the VLA. The size of the source at FWHM is
FORMULA  mas (FORMULA  kpc) and the derived intrinsic brightness temperature
is FORMULA  K. No continuum emission is
detected at the full VLBI resolution (FORMULA  mas, FORMULA  pc),
with a 4FORMULA 
point source upper limit of 34 FORMULA Jy beamFORMULA , or an upper limit to the
intrinsic brightness temperature of FORMULA  K. The highest angular
resolution with at least a 4.5FORMULA  detection of the radio
continuum emission is FORMULA  mas (FORMULA  kpc). At this
resolution, the image shows a continuum feature in BRI 1335–0417
with a size of FORMULA  mas (FORMULA  kpc) at FWHM,
and intrinsic brightness temperature of FORMULA  K.
The extent of the observed continuum sources at 1.4 GHz and the derived
brightness temperatures show that the radio emission (and thus presumably the far-infrared
emission) in BRI 1335–0417 is powered by a major starburst, with a massive star formation
rate of order a few thousand FORMULA . Moreover, the
absence of any compact high-brightness temperature source suggests that there
is no radio-loud AGN in this FORMULA  QSO.

INTRODUCTION
Optical surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000)
and the Digitized Palomar Sky Survey {{cite:75b712fb-7487-4fb4-9dec-00eac362a6cf}} have revealed large samples
of quasi-stellar objects out to FORMULA . Studies by {{cite:5f53fc96-d9fd-4f46-995b-bd43539f00ea}} and {{cite:21a3ee59-55d4-4c41-a1e8-21b280fbd9ec}} have shown that at such a high redshift we are approaching the epoch of
reionization, the edge of the “dark ages”, when the first stars and massive
black holes were formed.
Observations of high redshift QSOs at mm and sub-mm wavelengths have shown that
a significant fraction (FORMULA ) of the sources are strong emitters of
far-infrared (FIR) radiation, which is thermal emission from warm dust.
These sources have luminosities FORMULA , and
molecular gas masses greater than FORMULA  {{cite:4cc47daa-0306-4163-bcb4-e07b08d0ce04}}, {{cite:7b9ddb1c-2369-45c9-9c13-32bf2a311369}}.
Moreover, the large reservoirs of warm gas and dust in these objects have led to the
hypothesis that these are starburst galaxies with massive star formation rates
on the order of 1000 FORMULA  {{cite:bfd4eac7-c14c-472d-b6cd-bdcc001a13e6}}, {{cite:6d7dfd9e-da78-4968-87d9-0c3df39f3d79}}, {{cite:47446079-7e73-4286-b4f2-fc74f0541f66}}, {{cite:c4ae926f-0a24-4ac3-8409-31463dbace5f}}.
An important question regarding these high-FORMULA  QSOs is whether the dust
heating mechanism is dominated by a central AGN, or starburst activity in
the QSO host galaxies. The high resolution of Very Long
Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations permits a detailed look at the
physical structures in the most distant cosmic sources. Also, sensitive VLBI
continuum observations can be used to determine the nature of the energy
source(s) in these galaxies at radio frequencies.
To date, several high redshift QSOs have been imaged at milliarcsecond
resolution {{cite:b4c045e5-950c-406a-9630-189fd0016db2}}, {{cite:b8050953-009f-4a28-b06a-40816df23f14}}, {{cite:420a5d24-80fb-4664-bf0e-cb16889e003d}}, {{cite:a8e14176-9d81-4500-ae5e-befea0f8b4ac}}, {{cite:62815f00-e4bb-4fdf-bcdd-3ae129b14c9a}}. These are the highest resolution
studies of such distant QSOs by far. In this paper, we present sensitive VLBI
observations of the FORMULA  QSO BRI 1335–0417.
The source BRI 1335–0417, which has an optical redshift of FORMULA ,
was identified in the Automatic Plate Measuring (APM) survey {{cite:db1ff074-b844-4dc1-a6bd-032279e968c5}}, {{cite:a0c621d4-5929-467c-93dd-1b01e9e51f94}}.
This QSO is the second brightest source at millimeter wavelengths with redshifts
FORMULA , with the brightest being the FORMULA  QSO BRI 1202–0725 {{cite:8babd879-41bc-4717-b104-500ea2968c1c}}.
The implied FIR luminosity of BRI 1335–0417 is
FORMULA . Thus far, there is no evidence for
multiple imaging in BRI 1335–0417 due to strong gravitational lensing {{cite:eca1085b-cd4d-4f72-a513-e3db4a4495a9}}.
The optical spectrum of the QSO BRI 1335–0417 shows a strong absorption by LyFORMULA 
and metal lines at the source redshift {{cite:a0c621d4-5929-467c-93dd-1b01e9e51f94}}. Its CO FORMULA  line emission was detected
at FORMULA  {{cite:69b1ce60-449e-4b1c-b42c-255b560d6385}}.
The CO FORMULA  emission studies on this source by {{cite:eca1085b-cd4d-4f72-a513-e3db4a4495a9}} suggested optically thick emission
from warm (FORMULA  30 K) molecular gas. The derived total molecular gas mass is FORMULA , making BRI 1335–0417 one
of the most massive molecular gas reservoirs known at high redshifts.
The source BRI 1335–0417 is also detected in the radio continuum at 1.4 and 4.9 GHz with
the Very Large Array (VLA) in C-configuration, with
flux densities of FORMULA  and FORMULA Jy, respectively {{cite:eca1085b-cd4d-4f72-a513-e3db4a4495a9}}, {{cite:f3c2288a-2c05-4c2c-958a-14253ec617d9}}.
The source appears unresolved at the resolution of these VLA observations, which is on the order of
several arcseconds.
Throughout this paper, we assume a flat cosmological model with
FORMULA , FORMULA , and
FORMULA  km sFORMULA  MpcFORMULA . In this model, at the distance of BRI
1335–0417, 1 milliarcsecond (mas) corresponds to 6.6 pc.

OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION
The VLBI observations of BRI 1335–0417 were carried out at 1.4 GHz on 2005 December 31 and
2006 January 7, using the High Sensitivity Array (HSA), which included
the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), the phased Very Large Array (VLA), and the
Green Bank Telescope (GBT) of the NRAOThe National Radio Astronomy
Observatory is a facility of the National Science Foundation operated under
cooperative agreement by Associated Universities, Inc.. Four adjacent 8 MHz
baseband channel pairs were used in the observations, both with right and
left-hand circular polarizations, and sampled at two bits. The data were
correlated at the VLBA correlator in Socorro, NM, with 2 s correlator
integration time. The total observing time was
14 hr.
In these observations, the shortest baseline is between the phased VLA and the VLBA antenna in
Pie Town, NM, which is 52 km. This short-spacing limit filters out all spatial structure
larger than about FORMULA . Table 1 summarizes the parameters of these observations.
The observations employed nodding-style phase referencing, using the calibrator
J1335–0511 (FORMULA  Jy), with a cycle time of 4 min, 3 min on the
target source and 1 min
on the calibrator. A number of test cycles were also included to monitor the
coherence of the phase referencing. These tests involved switching between two
calibrators, the phase calibrator J1335–0511 and the phase-check calibrator
J1332–0509 (FORMULA  Jy), using a similar cycle time to that used for
the target source.
The accuracy of the phase calibrator position is important in phase-referencing
observations {{cite:abf69e29-28f6-43e5-9a03-7235455353c6}}, as this determines the accuracy of the absolute
position of the target source and any associated components. Phase referencing,
as used here, is known to preserve absolute astrometric positions to better
than FORMULA  {{cite:c6e01a70-c7b0-436d-932e-be49c320f9f3}}.
Data reduction and analysis were performed using the Astronomical Image
Processing System (AIPS) and Astronomical Information Processing System
(AIPSFORMULA ) of the NRAO. After applying a priori flagging, amplitude
calibration was performed using measurements of the antenna gain and system
temperature for each station. Ionospheric corrections were applied using the
AIPS task “TECOR”. The phase calibrator J1335–0511 was self-calibrated in
both phase and amplitude and imaged in an iterative cycle.
Images of the phase-check calibrator, J1332–0509, were deconvolved using two
different approaches: (a) by applying the phase and the amplitude
self-calibration solutions of the phase reference source J1335–0511
(Figure 1a), and (b) by self calibrating J1332–0509 itself, in both
phase and amplitude (Figure 1b). The peak surface brightness ratio of
the final images from the two approaches gives a measure of the effect of
residual phase errors after phase referencing (i.e. `the coherence' due to
phase referencing). At all times, the coherence was found to be better than
98%.
The self-calibration solutions of the phase calibrator, J1335–0511, were
applied on the target source, BRI 1335–0417, which was then deconvolved and imaged at
various spatial resolutions by tapering the visibility data.

RESULTS & ANALYSIS
Imaging the target source at the full resolution of the VLBI array, which is
FORMULA  mas (FORMULA  pc, PA=FORMULA ), achieved an rms noise level of
FORMULA Jy beamFORMULA , but did not reveal any continuum component
in the field of BRI 1335–0417. This indicates the absence of any compact radio
continuum emission with flux densities of FORMULA Jy beamFORMULA , which in turn implies an upper limit to the intrinsic brightness
temperature (corresponding to a rest frequency of FORMULA 8 GHz)
of FORMULA  K for any compact radio source in
BRI 1335–0417. Our coherence tests during these
observations using two VLBI calibrators show that the lack of a strong point
source in BRI 1335–0417 at the full resolution of the array cannot be due to
the phase referencing procedure. The 4FORMULA 
flux limit reported above is almost an order of magnitude lower than the flux measured by
the VLA (FORMULA Jy) at 1.4 GHz {{cite:eca1085b-cd4d-4f72-a513-e3db4a4495a9}}.
This immediately implies that more than FORMULA 80%
of the radio continuum emission in BRI 1335–0417 is extended and not
confined to the central AGN.
In the following, we will assess if our HSA observations can recover the flux
seen by the VLA. To do so, we applied a two-dimensional Gaussian taper falling to
30% at 1 MFORMULA  to the visibility data in both the u- and v-directions.
This gives a beam size of FORMULA  mas
(FORMULA  kpc, P. A.= FORMULA ), and the resulting image is shown in Figure 2.
The rms noise level in this naturally weighted image is FORMULA Jy beamFORMULA . The
peak flux density of the detected continuum source is FORMULA Jy beamFORMULA , and the total
flux density is FORMULA Jy, which agrees
well with the flux density measured with the VLA at 1.4 GHz {{cite:eca1085b-cd4d-4f72-a513-e3db4a4495a9}}.
The size of the source at full width half maximum (FWHM) is FORMULA  mas
(FORMULA  kpc), and the derived intrinsic brightness temperature is
FORMULA  K.
Figure 3 shows the continuum emission in BRI 1335–0417 at the highest angular
resolutions for which there is at least 4.5FORMULA  detection (FORMULA Jy beamFORMULA ).
This corresponds to a resolution of FORMULA  mas (FORMULA  kpc) in
position angle FORMULA . This image was obtained by
applying a two-dimensional Gaussian taper falling to 30% at 5 MFORMULA 
in both the u- and v-directions of the visibility
data. The peak flux density of the continuum source detected at this resolution is
FORMULA Jy beamFORMULA , and the total flux density is FORMULA Jy.
The size of the source is FORMULA  mas (FORMULA  kpc) at FWHM,
and its intrinsic brightness temperature is
FORMULA  K. The results obtained at this resolution imply that about
two thirds of the total radio emission emerges from the central FORMULA 0.3 kpc of
BRI 1335–0417, and, likewise, one third arises from more extended scales (FORMULA 1.3 kpc).

DISCUSSION
We have detected 1.4 GHz emission from BRI 1335–00417 (corresponding to a rest frame
frequency of FORMULA 8 GHz) using the HSA. At a moderate resolution (FORMULA  mas; Figure 2)
the intrinsic brightness temperature value of the detected continuum structure is
FORMULA  K. The measured flux density at this resolution
is consistent with the VLA flux density of this source {{cite:eca1085b-cd4d-4f72-a513-e3db4a4495a9}}.
This implies that the radio continuum emission at
1.4 GHz is confined to the extent of the structure seen in the VLBI
image (Figure 2), which is FORMULA  kpc at FWHM. Furthermore, the highest
resolution image
with continuum detection (Figure 3) shows that almost two thirds of the total
radio continuum emission at 1.4 GHz is arising from the central FORMULA 0.3 kpc.
At the full resolution of our array (FORMULA  mas), the radio emission from
BRI 1335–0417 is resolved out and does not show any single dominant source of
very high brightness temperature (FORMULA  K).
This is in contrast to
the results obtained by {{cite:420a5d24-80fb-4664-bf0e-cb16889e003d}} on a sample of three high-FORMULA  radio-loud
quasars which were imaged with the VLBA, namely J1053-0016 (FORMULA ), J1235-0003 (FORMULA ),
and J0913+5919 (FORMULA ). In each of these FORMULA  quasars, a
radio-loud AGN dominates the emission at 1.4 GHz on a few mas size scale, with
intrinsic brightness temperatures in excess of FORMULA  K.
{{cite:3953cafa-3818-4fab-88f9-33d2fe093d55}} have derived an empirical upper limit to the brightness
temperature for nuclear starbursts of FORMULA  K at 8 GHz (our rest frequency),
while typical
radio-loud AGN have brightness temperatures exceeding this value by at least
two orders of magnitude. These authors also present a possible physical model
for this limit involving a mixed non-thermal and thermal radio emitting (and
absorbing) plasma, constrained by the radio-to-FIR correlation for star-forming
galaxies.
For BRI 1335–0417, the derived intrinsic brightness
temperatures from our VLBI observations are typical of starburst galaxies.
Also, the linear extent of the radio continuum emission region in
BRI 1335–0417 is typical of local starburst powered Ultra-Luminous IR galaxies
(ULIRGs; Sanders & Mirabel 1996), such as Arp 220, Mrk 273, and
IRAS 17208–0014 {{cite:9c7ca841-1589-483c-8016-e08b41ccc2e9}}, {{cite:378c9059-c4fe-4bba-be9f-a043337e7cff}}, {{cite:21875f4a-8884-47c3-a70c-5e2bc6558723}}.
Another argument in favor of a massive starburst origin for the radio continuum
emission from BRI 1335–0417 is that this source follows the radio-FIR correlation for
star forming galaxies, although the massive star formation rate is extreme, of order a few
thousand FORMULA  {{cite:eca1085b-cd4d-4f72-a513-e3db4a4495a9}}.
The physical characteristics of the QSO BRI 1335–0417 are similar to two other
high-FORMULA  luminous IR sources; the brightest mm source in the {{cite:36eaa467-aea5-4707-a4df-7e209d4d5259}} sample of QSOs with
redshifts between FORMULA , namely J1409+5628 at FORMULA , and the brightest mm
source in the {{cite:8babd879-41bc-4717-b104-500ea2968c1c}}
sample of QSOs at redshifts FORMULA , namely BRI 1202–0725 at FORMULA .
High angular resolution observations of J1409+5628 and BRI 1202–0725 at 1.4 GHz
{{cite:a8e14176-9d81-4500-ae5e-befea0f8b4ac}}, {{cite:2dea5c35-67a3-455d-9a34-573a285a8236}} showed
that the radio continuum emission in these optically very bright QSOs is dominated by
extreme nuclear starbursts, with massive star formation rates on the order of
FORMULA . Moreover, sensitive, tapered VLBI images of BRI 1202–0725
at 1.4 GHz {{cite:62815f00-e4bb-4fdf-bcdd-3ae129b14c9a}} revealed the starburst regions in each of its two components that are separated by 4, with
sizes and brightness temperatures comparable to that seen in BRI 1335–0417.
The measured 1.4 GHz radio flux density in BRI 1335–0417 is consistent
with extreme nuclear starburst activity, with the radio continuum being the sum of
supernovae (SNe), supernova remnants, and residual relativistic electrons in the interstellar
medium, as shown in the model presented by {{cite:3953cafa-3818-4fab-88f9-33d2fe093d55}}. However, detecting
individual SNe at FORMULA  is unlikely.
{{cite:9c7ca841-1589-483c-8016-e08b41ccc2e9}} reported the detection of several luminous radio SNe in the
prototype ULIRG Arp 220 with flux densities between 0.2 and 1.17 mJy and
angular sizes on the order of 0.25 mas. At the distance of BRI 1335–0417, the
flux densities of such luminous radio SNe would be between FORMULA Jy. These values are three to four orders of magnitude lower that the
rms noise levels achieved in our VLBI observations.
