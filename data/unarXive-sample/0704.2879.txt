asymptotic Hopf invariant, or helicity, for Hamiltonian systems
with one-and-a-half degrees of freedom and symplectic
diffeomorphisms of a two-disk to itself.
Helicity integral for Hamiltonian systems
Consider a Hamiltonian system on the extended phase space
FORMULA  with symplectic coordinates FORMULA  and time FORMULA , given by a
Hamiltonian FORMULA :
FORMULA 
Let FORMULA  be an invariant disk for this system (which
always exists for integrable systems with bounded energy levels and
near-integrable systems, close to them). An integral over a solid
torus FORMULA :
FORMULA 
where the function FORMULA  equals zero on the
boundary FORMULA , will be called helicity for the Hamiltonian system (REF ). It is easy to see
that this definition is consistent – the value FORMULA  does
not depend on the choice of the symplectic coordinates. The term
”helicity” is chosen, as the integral (REF ) equals (up
to a multiplier 2) to the helicity of the Hamiltonian vector field
FORMULA  (with invariant measure on the extended phase
space being FORMULA ):
FORMULA 
provided the 1-form FORMULA  is chosen such that
FORMULA 
Indeed, as FORMULA , then, due to
(REF ), FORMULA .
Relation (REF ) is now obtained by the integration by
parts, cf. {{cite:62d10a31-f2fd-4e79-8485-6f673b6b546e}}. Notice that, as we have assumed that the
disk FORMULA  is invariant, from Condition (REF ) follows that
FORMULA  on its boundary FORMULA .
The helicity invariant has the following ergodic interpretation: it
measures asymptotic linking of the trajectories of the Hamiltonian
vector field FORMULA  in the solid torus FORMULA ,
which in turn is itself unlinked (and untwisted), see {{cite:62d10a31-f2fd-4e79-8485-6f673b6b546e}}
for details. In particular, the invariant (REF ) does not
change after rescaling FORMULA , FORMULA  – the
average linking of the trajectories remain the same.
Remark. Expression (REF ) is still well defined if
the Hamiltonian FORMULA  is discontinuous at some FORMULA . One can show that
the ergodic interpretation of (REF ) remains the same.
Expression (REF ) is exactly the same as the expression
for the Calabi invariant, see {{cite:2efc4ea3-1c59-47eb-9e3e-a37dda031f89}}. The difference is that
above we have not assumed that the gradient of the Hamiltonian FORMULA 
is zero on the boundary torus FORMULA  (which is an assumption
in the Calabi invariant definition). Of course if we have assumed
that, then (REF ) would be the Calabi invariant.

Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms
Consider a symplectic mapping FORMULA . There exists a
Hamiltonian system (with the Hamiltonian FORMULA  depending
FORMULA -periodically on time), which Poincaré map FORMULA 
coincides with FORMULA  (actually, there are infinitely many such
systems, and one can show that they have the same smoothness as the
mapping itself, see, e.g., {{cite:d82e5443-5c10-4f09-b898-097be39d35c9}}). Notice that for the
calculations below, it does not matter which period to take (due to
the ergodic interpretation of the helicity integral).
The Calabi invariant is an invariant of the symplectic mapping,
identical at the boundary, and it does not depend on a paricular
choice of the underlying Hamiltonian system, see, e.g., {{cite:0358b366-c2d8-4bb5-b02e-fa8ec3711277}}.
On the contrary, if we only demand that the mapping FORMULA  sends the
boundary FORMULA  to itself, then the value of the integral
(REF ) may depend on a particular choice of the
Hamiltonian flow. However, the values of FORMULA  will be
”quantized” by the square of the sympectic area FORMULA  of the disk
FORMULA :
Theorem 2.1 
Let a symplectic mapping FORMULA  be given, which sends a
boundary FORMULA  to itself. Let FORMULA  and FORMULA  be
two Hamiltonian flows, given by FORMULA -periodic Hamiltonians FORMULA 
and FORMULA , such that FORMULA . Then,
FORMULA  for some FORMULA .

Proof. We first prove the following
Lemma 2.2 
Let FORMULA . Then for any FORMULA , such that FORMULA ,
FORMULA , FORMULA .

Proof of Lemma REF . The mapping FORMULA  turns the
boundary circle by the angle FORMULA , FORMULA  (because
of continuity, no other transformation of the circle than the pure
rotation is allowed). Take a bigger disk FORMULA , which contains
FORMULA , and define a mapping FORMULA ,
stationary at the boundary FORMULA , and coinciding with
FORMULA  in FORMULA . The Calabi invariant for the mapping FORMULA  does
not depend on an underlying Hamiltonian flow. If we take the flow
that coincides with FORMULA  inside FORMULA , and that is stationary at
the outer boundary FORMULA , then, as we tend FORMULA , its Calabi invariant will tend to FORMULA , as
FORMULA  will tend to zero as FORMULA .
Now, we take the Hamiltonian FORMULA  in FORMULA , such that in
FORMULA , FORMULA , where FORMULA , FORMULA  are the
”action-angle” variables, such that the disk FORMULA  is given by
inequality FORMULA , and the disk FORMULA  is given by FORMULA , FORMULA . We define the constant FORMULA  later. Let FORMULA . The function FORMULA  in FORMULA  can
be taken as
FORMULA 
Indeed, FORMULA , FORMULA  and
FORMULA 
As FORMULA , the constant FORMULA .
The Calabi invariant equals
FORMULA 
As we turn FORMULA , we get
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the symplectic area of the disk FORMULA .  FORMULA
Now, to prove the theorem, consider a mapping FORMULA . This mapping is identical. Its asymptotic Hopf
invariant equals sum of asymptotic Hopf invariants for systems with
Hamiltonians FORMULA  and FORMULA , which, by Lemma REF , equals FORMULA .  FORMULA
Remark. The group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a 2-disk,
identical at the boundary, is known to be contractible, see
{{cite:f366a220-e475-40df-8c9b-64e7a9af3356}}. In particular, the Calabi 1-form, defined as the
right-invariant differential form, coinciding with the Calabi
integral
FORMULA 
on the Lie algebra of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of disk FORMULA , is
exact, see {{cite:0358b366-c2d8-4bb5-b02e-fa8ec3711277}}. If we drop the condition that a Hamiltonian
diffeomorphism is identical at the boundary, then from Theorem
REF  follows that this form (which is still correctly defined
and closed) is no longer exact, and thus the topology of the group
of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms becomes more complicated.
The statement converse to Theorem REF  is also true. Let a
smooth symplectic mapping FORMULA  and a number FORMULA  be given.
Theorem 2.3 
There are two smooth Hamiltonian systems, given by Hamiltonians
FORMULA  and FORMULA , FORMULA -periodic in FORMULA , such that FORMULA , and
FORMULA 

Proof. It is well-known that a symplectic mapping can be
inserted into a Hamiltonian flow, see, e.g., {{cite:d82e5443-5c10-4f09-b898-097be39d35c9}}. Let this
flow be given by a Hamiltonian FORMULA  (which is zero on the boundary
FORMULA ). Let FORMULA  be the ”action-angle” variables, such
that the disk FORMULA  is given by FORMULA . Take now the following
function:
FORMULA 
Obviously, FORMULA . Now, we have to construct a smooth Hamiltonian
FORMULA  with the same helicity as FORMULA . We show that this can
be done by time transformation.
Suppose that we want to make FORMULA  differentiable (once, in time).
Consider the following time transformation: FORMULA . The helicity integral becomes:
FORMULA 
where we denoted FORMULA . Obviously, FORMULA  (being a
FORMULA -periodic function of FORMULA ).
To obtain smoothness of order FORMULA , one can construct
time transformation, which is given by FORMULA , such that at FORMULA  and FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA 
correspondingly for small FORMULA . For example, for FORMULA , take
FORMULA 
Remark. Theorem REF  is also true in the analytic case.
The proof is simple modulus results in {{cite:d82e5443-5c10-4f09-b898-097be39d35c9}}: one should for
example use the smoothing technique from {{cite:d82e5443-5c10-4f09-b898-097be39d35c9}} to get an
analytic system from the smooth one, obtained during the proof of
Theorem REF . Notice also that if two Hamiltonian functions are
close to each other (in an appropriate topology) and they define the
same mapping, then the helicity will also be the same – by
continuity of the helicity functional and by Theorem REF .
From Theorem REF  follows that a symplectic mapping can be
inserted into a Hamiltonian flow with any given helicity level. In
particular, there exists the flow with smallest (in the absolute
value) helicity, which is a functional of the mapping only. This
smallest helicity will be called the generalized Calabi
invariant.
We do not write down explicitly the generalized Calabi invariant as
the functional of a symplectomorphism here. We only note that it can
be written as a sum of two parts: an integral over the disk, and an
integral over the boundary circle. One way to see that is to take
the limiting procedure, as we did in the proof of Lemma REF .
