ABSTRACT
The holographic conjecture for black holes localized on a 3-brane in
Randall-Sundrum braneworld models RS2 predicts the existence of a
classical 5D time dependent solution dual to a 4D evaporating black
hole. After briefly reviewing recent criticism and presenting some
difficulties in the holographic interpretation of the
Gregory-Laflamme instability, we simulate some basic features of
such a solution by studying null geodesics of the Schwarzschild
black string, in particular those propagating nontrivially in the
bulk, and using holographic arguments.

Introduction
Holography is an important tool to relate seemingly different
theories living in different spacetime dimensions. The FORMULA /CFT
correspondence {{cite:4a736e9d-0f3e-4a65-8f91-5a1c4fdd0d9f}} adapted to the Randall-Sundrum
braneworld model RS2 {{cite:b5a61d28-d727-4a5c-88e9-d65231203305}} predicts that classical
bulk physics in FORMULA  is dual to a particular cut-off CFT
(namely FORMULA  SU(FORMULA ) SYM in the planar limit) coupled to
gravity living on the brane. A concrete realization of this is
provided by the calculation of the correction to the Newtonian
potential on the brane, which can be performed in two very
different ways giving the same result. Studying linear
gravitational perturbations (5D gravitons) of the form FORMULA , with FORMULA , around the
Randall-Sundrum vacuum
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is related to the five-dimensional cosmological constant
by FORMULA , Garriga and Tanaka {{cite:d83c87f9-c17a-4c95-8dec-c813967e307e}}
found that the gravitational potential on the brane (FORMULA )
generated by a mass FORMULA  is
FORMULA 
for scales FORMULA . The first, Newtonian, term is given by the
zero-mode (FORMULA ) bound to the brane, while the second,
corrective, term is the contribution induced by the massive modes
(FORMULA ) living in the bulk. On the other hand, from a pure 4D
perspective, Duff {{cite:c91822d6-4485-421e-a89f-e1b302f4741f}} found that the quantum
corrected Newtonian potential is given by
FORMULA 
where the coefficient FORMULA  depends on the
relevant CFT, FORMULA  counting the number of degrees of freedom. If
one combines this result with the holographic relation
FORMULA 
one recovers
exactly (REF ) {{cite:77cef8af-9d12-422c-9747-70510f3bd412}} (see also
{{cite:b7cf99eb-518d-4868-84d6-c889edf40c91}}). The equivalence between the expressions
(REF ) and (REF ) shows that the quantum
corrections due to the CFT are classically given by the bulk
massive modes FORMULA .
Application of holographic ideas beyond the linearized level, in
particular to the extreme case of black holes, has led to the
conjecture that for large masses “black hole solutions localized on
the brane in the FORMULA  braneworld which are found by solving
the classical bulk equations in FORMULA  correspond to
quantum-corrected black holes in FORMULA  dimensions, rather than
classical ones” {{cite:f9bbc11a-6f08-4e60-bd59-8ab3e17f200b}}.
Evidence for this conjecture comes from the explicit solutions of
black holes localized on a 2-brane in FORMULA  {{cite:f6734fd0-34c0-4624-80b9-44662c724e53}} and on a
1-brane in FORMULA  {{cite:c8c642ea-3521-4562-8e95-4121501caac3}}, but in the physically
relevant case of a black hole on a 3-brane in FORMULA  things are
much more complicated and no static solutions of this type have been
found yet {{cite:2e509889-df93-4a95-a464-ec01b8d7faa9}}. The lack of a full 5D braneworld solution
giving a 4D static asymptotically flat black hole localized on a
3-brane is naturally explained by the holographic conjecture: a
quantum corrected 4D black hole cannot be static as it would
evaporate via the Hawking effect.
Recently, as a counterexample to this argument the RS2
Schwarzschild black string solution {{cite:81dda859-d1ef-4b9b-9313-ac2f5990ae5e}}
FORMULA 
was considered in {{cite:6dad8daa-8e62-4b8d-b29a-f9fa98445119}}. Indeed, this solution
gives the classical Schwarzschild solution on the brane. To
justify the absence of quantum corrections in the dual theory, it
was speculated in {{cite:6dad8daa-8e62-4b8d-b29a-f9fa98445119}} that due to strong
coupling effects the number of asymptotic degrees of freedom is
drastically reduced and this would imply that the radiation
vanishes at leading order (where only terms which are FORMULA  survive).
The arguments used in {{cite:6dad8daa-8e62-4b8d-b29a-f9fa98445119}} are based on the
fact that on a sphere of radius FORMULA  and at large 't Hooft coupling
FORMULA  the energy separation for weakly interacting states is
FORMULA 
and thus the spectrum is lifted to infinite energy apart from the
FORMULA  massless states dual to the supergravity modes of the
string. However, note that in the flat limit FORMULA  the
above mass gap disappears and this is consistent with the
perturbative calculation (REF ), which in the dual CFT
gives FORMULA  results. The same happens in cosmology
{{cite:2fc0a36c-c617-4ae3-8b49-28104a414893}}. It is difficult to believe that the number
of massless degrees of freedom is in general FORMULA  except for the
cases where explicit verification is possible, i.e. flat and
cosmological branes. Another problem with the proposed holographic
interpretation of (REF ) is to explain why, besides the
absence of a radiative term, all the quantum corrections (say, the
vacuum polarization terms) are actually suppressed.
Moreover, as already pointed out in {{cite:81dda859-d1ef-4b9b-9313-ac2f5990ae5e}}, the
singularity at FORMULA  extends all the way from FORMULA  to FORMULA ,
making the AdS horizon singular as well.The authors of
{{cite:6dad8daa-8e62-4b8d-b29a-f9fa98445119}} have tried to remove this problem by
considering an additional brane. This in the dual theory on the
brane implies that the CFT is cut-off also in the IR. Therefore,
such solution is likely not to have a counterpart in the dual CFT.
It has been suggested that the Gregory-Laflamme (GL) instability
{{cite:89e56a33-2fa2-4358-b26d-bf6f1ee9e69d}}, {{cite:5b46ef2f-a292-470b-ab0f-0cbb42e0da7c}} of (REF ) is dual to Hawking radiation in
the boundary theory {{cite:a432bf03-777b-4501-a31f-71d5bb827d22}}. We will show in section
2 that a quantitative comparison of the GL brane perturbed metric
with that of an evaporating 4D black hole in the near-horizon region
shows some problematic points. We will then turn, in section 3, to
an interesting feature of the RS2 Schwarzschild black string which
we discovered by studying null geodesics and in particular those
propagating nontrivially in the bulk. Indeed, in the `geometrical
optics' approximation, 5D gravitational waves (in particular, bulk
massive modes) travel along such geodesics and these, in turn, might
contain “seeds” of quantum effects in the dual theory. The
holographic interpretation of our results, in section 4, leads us to
conjecture some crucial features of the actual 5D configuration dual
to an evaporating 4D black hole. This is done in section 5. Finally,
in section 6 we briefly state our conclusions.

GL instability and Hawking radiation
An important property of the RS2 black string comes from the analysis of its linear gravitational perturbations
which leads to the well-known Gregory-Laflamme instability.
In view
of the holographic black holes conjecture {{cite:f9bbc11a-6f08-4e60-bd59-8ab3e17f200b}} it is
natural to wonder whether such classical instability corresponds,
in the boundary theory, to the quantum instability of the 4D
Schwarzschild spacetime via Hawking radiation.
Considering the metric (REF ), it was shown by Gregory
{{cite:5b46ef2f-a292-470b-ab0f-0cbb42e0da7c}} that the instability for the flat black string initially
discovered in {{cite:89e56a33-2fa2-4358-b26d-bf6f1ee9e69d}} simply generalizes to this warped case.
Perturbations of the metric
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
take
the following form in the FORMULA  limit
FORMULA 

while
FORMULA 
with the coefficients FORMULA  and FORMULA 
satisfying
FORMULA 
The suitable time coordinate to parameterize the (future) horizon
is not FORMULA  but FORMULA , the ingoing Eddington-Finkelstein null
coordinate (FORMULA ). In terms of FORMULA  the
above perturbations take the form
FORMULA 

These vanish at the past horizon (FORMULA ).
With the change of coordinates FORMULA  the perturbed
metric on the brane (FORMULA ) along the future horizon takes the
ingoing Vaidya form
FORMULA 
with mass
function given by
FORMULA 
The numerical results show that for FORMULA 
the most favored instability has FORMULA  and FORMULA , while for general FORMULA  we have FORMULA  and
FORMULA .
In the large FORMULA  (i.e. FORMULA ) limit the leading order term in
FORMULA  is
FORMULA 
where we have used the expansions FORMULA  and FORMULA 
valid for FORMULA .
Note that the value for FORMULA  used in {{cite:d83c87f9-c17a-4c95-8dec-c813967e307e}} is FORMULA . Moreover,
the instability exists in the range FORMULA ,
so the perturbed black string
is approximated by
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
We should compare (REF ) and (REF ) on the brane
with the metric of a four-dimensional evaporating black hole in
the near horizon region, which takes the form (REF )
{{cite:62500020-52cb-4f2d-bbcc-93b2a885bb65}} with
FORMULA 
the emission taking place starting from some initial FORMULA  (due to
the fact that the black hole is created from a gravitational
collapse). Differentiating (REF ) we get
FORMULA 
where we have used the fact that FORMULA . Neither the powers
of FORMULA  (using the holographic relation (REF )) nor
those of FORMULA  match those in (REF ).
Despite this negative comparison, one should not give up hopes to
find a solution with the holographic behaviour (REF ).
First, it is not clear whether the boundary conditions used in
{{cite:89e56a33-2fa2-4358-b26d-bf6f1ee9e69d}} correspond, in the dual theory, to a black hole created
via gravitational collapse. Also, we should not exclude the
possibility that the dual Hawking radiation cannot be seen from a
classical linear perturbation analysis in 5D, but needs a full
nonlinear treatment.

Analysis of the Black String null geodesics
We will now focus on a different type of analysis. The KK
modes/CFT modes correspondence of eqs. (REF ),
(REF ) tells us that quantum effects on the brane are
induced by gravitational waves, which, in turn, propagate along
null geodesics of the full 5D spacetime. Keeping this in mind, let
us consider the full black string
FORMULA 
here written in advanced Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates (in the
RS2 case the spacetime is cut at FORMULA  and FORMULA ).
There are two families of null geodesics in the background
(REF ) and this can be easily seen by considering the FORMULA 
component of the geodesics equations
FORMULA 
which reads
FORMULA 
where a dot denotes a derivative with respect to the affine
parameter FORMULA . The first family is associated to the solution
FORMULA 
i.e.
FORMULA 
including, in particular, the null geodesics on the brane (FORMULA )
for the RS2 black string. The second, the nontrivial one, is given
by
FORMULA 
which is integrated toIn the case of the RS2 black
string, the FORMULA  sign refers to geodesics propagating from the bulk
towards the brane and the FORMULA  sign to those propagating from the
brane towards the bulk.
FORMULA 
The solution to the null geodesics equations
can be obtained by considering the first integrals of motion. We
have (consider motion in the equatorial plane FORMULA )
FORMULA 
and, due to the fact that FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are Killing vectors,
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are constants.
In the case (REF ) with FORMULA  (on the brane, for the RS2
black string) and FORMULA  we have the usual Schwarzschild ingoing
and outgoing radial null geodesics. For ingoing geodesics
(FORMULA const) we have
FORMULA 
Outgoing geodesics play a key role to determine the
position of the future apparent horizon on the brane, defined as
the surface where the radius of the two-sphere FORMULA  has zero
divergence (FORMULA ). From (REF ) and (REF ) and
considering FORMULA  we have
FORMULA 

from which we get
FORMULA 
and, also,
FORMULA 
Outgoing geodesics diverge for FORMULA  (FORMULA ) and converge when
FORMULA  (FORMULA ). The particular outgoing geodesics that remain on
the future horizon
FORMULA 
for which
FORMULA 
are characterized by FORMULA , and thus
FORMULA 
We will perform a similar analysis for the null geodesics of the
second family (REF ). For FORMULA  and using (REF ) we
getIt is not difficult to generalise our analysis to
FORMULA .
FORMULA 

Note that due to the nontrivial motion in the bulk (FORMULA ) (REF ) implies FORMULA . We can then divide
(REF ) by FORMULA  and subtract () to get
FORMULA 
which substituted into () gives a quadratic equation for
 FORMULA
FORMULA 
This equation implies the two behaviors
FORMULA 
and, from (REF ),
FORMULA 
The equations obtained
correspond to (radial) timelike geodesics in a 4D Schwarzschild
spacetime with an affine parameter FORMULA  {{cite:81dda859-d1ef-4b9b-9313-ac2f5990ae5e}}.
The purpose of this analysis is to see whether nontrivial bulk null
geodesics, presumably associated to the trajectories of the massive
KK modes, can give us some hints of quantum effects in the dual
theory on the brane. To understand if such “quantum effects” would
modify the horizon, eqs. (REF )-(REF ) suggest that we
should focus on the special case FORMULA ,
where we have
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
Integration of (REF ) is
straightforward and using (REF ) we get
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the integration constant. We shall now impose the
boundary condition that FORMULA  when FORMULA .We
will justify this choice at the end of section 5. This implies
FORMULA  and, also, that the only real solution is the one with the FORMULA 
sign, namely
FORMULA 
The curve (REF ) is plotted for FORMULA  and FORMULA  (we are
interested in the large mass regime) in fig. REF .
FIGURE 
From (REF ) in the near horizon region FORMULA  we
obtainIn the case FORMULA  one finds
FORMULA .
The correction to the FORMULA 
case is, for large masses, very small.
FORMULA 
It is now interesting to evaluate FORMULA  in this limit, and show
that is does not vanish unlike the corresponding case
(REF ). In fact from () (with FORMULA ) we get
FORMULA 
and using (REF ),
FORMULA 

Hawking radiation in the holographic dual?
Having established that massive modes “see” the horizon in quite
a different way, compare (REF ) with (REF ) and
(REF ) with (REF ), we shall now turn to the
possible holographic implications of our results (see also
{{cite:0731b1bb-6ab6-4fa9-ad26-83f2dd959186}}).
In the RS2 case, let us project (REF ) on the brane to get
FORMULA 
and use the holographic relation (REF )
FORMULA 
We have seen in section 2 that for the case of evaporating black
holes the apparent horizon FORMULA  is such that, see
(REF ) and (REF ),
FORMULA 
The similarity with (REF ) is quite interesting, the only
difference being that in (REF ) we have the multiplicative
factor FORMULA , indicating “thermal emission” due to a large number
of matter fields at the temperature FORMULA .
It is not easy to justify the holographic interpretation proposed
in (REF ) and its comparison with (REF ). The black
string horizon is at FORMULA , it is not receding. So why should
bulk null geodesics in the unperturbed Schwarzschild black string
know about Hawking radiation in the dual theory? We do not have a
precise answer to this question. However, we note that the
discovery of the Hawking effect {{cite:eaa78052-86aa-4ebc-b16e-47f381a37d8d}} was
performed in fixed background approximation, its implication being
that due to the quantum corrections the Schwarzschild solution
turns to a new solution with the (apparent) horizon satisfying
(REF ).
In our case, since bulk massive modes (presumably) travel along
the null geodesics (REF ) and they are the ones responsible
for the quantum effects on the brane, our result (REF )
makes it reasonable to expect
that the black string too will be modified to a time-dependent
configuration with the horizon on the dual theory on the brane
evolving according to (REF ).
In addition to this, we know that in an evaporating black hole
scenario, due to the black hole emission apparent and event horizons
(coincident for the static Schwarzschild solution FORMULA ) separate and a `quantum ergosphere' forms in
between (FORMULA ) {{cite:8d808425-b1a3-4a8c-87cc-d50415a875b2}}.
Approximate calculations (valid for large FORMULA ) of the location of
the event horizon, when the effects of the evaporation are taken
into account, show that {{cite:62500020-52cb-4f2d-bbcc-93b2a885bb65}}, {{cite:48207b9e-2ef5-456a-a83a-a35ac236b8c3}}
FORMULA 
Note that the event horizon too recedes according to (REF )
{{cite:8d808425-b1a3-4a8c-87cc-d50415a875b2}}. Waves emitted from the quantum ergosphere with
wavelength FORMULA  are detected at infinity with FORMULA , which is indeed the typical size of the Hawking quanta.
As in the static case (FORMULA ) there is no
emission, the existence of this region is deeply connected with
Hawking radiation.
In our case, (REF ) identifies on the brane a surface
just inside the horizon, the distance from it being
FORMULA 
Using again the holographic relation (REF ) we get
FORMULA 
which is very similar to (REF ) except for the fact that the
“quantum ergosphere” in the dual theory on the brane, being
multiplied by the big number FORMULA , would be much larger than in the
standard case.

Features of the 5D solution dual to a 4D evaporating black hole
The analogy between (REF ) and (REF ) and between
(REF ) and (REF ) is somewhat surprising.
We shall now use it to conjecture some of the crucial features of
the actual time-dependent 5D solution allowing the holographic
interpretations (REF ) and (REF ) in the dual
theory. We stress that our considerations concern configurations
where the mass is large, i.e. as long as FORMULA . Indeed,
when FORMULA  becomes of order FORMULA  it is not clear whether the
holographic conjecture {{cite:f9bbc11a-6f08-4e60-bd59-8ab3e17f200b}} still holds.
We recall that in braneworlds there are two different definitions
of apparent horizons, the brane apparent horizon
FORMULA , defined with respect to photons
which propagate along null geodesics of the 4D brane, and the bulk
apparent horizon FORMULA , referring to
gravitons which follow null geodesics of the full 5D spacetime.
The static RS2 black string, for which
FORMULA , is
a special case. Indeed, in {{cite:00cbdc11-0cf3-4672-9fa7-f1f541155029}} it was
numerically shown that in time-dependent braneworld black hole
solutions brane and bulk horizons are generally distinct, the
brane apparent horizon being always larger than the (brane
projected) bulk horizon.
The black strings null geodesics (REF ) and
(REF ), along with their associated surfaces FORMULA  and
FORMULA  in (REF ), (REF ), allowed us
to reproduce such feature.
It is thus tempting to speculate that
FORMULA  simulates
the bulk apparent horizon FORMULA  of
the actual 5D time dependent solution,
its projection on the brane playing the role of the event horizon
in the dual theory. In a way this is not too surprising, given
that (classical) gravitons cannot escape from inside
FORMULA  and, similarly, the dual (quantum)
CFT modes cannot be emitted from the interior of
FORMULA .Probably a careful analysis based on
the full solution will rather identify the brane projection of the
bulk event horizon (FORMULA ) with the
dual event horizon FORMULA  (FORMULA  in
semiclassical evaporating spacetimes).
A large “quantum ergosphere”
FORMULA 
would then form on the brane. The dual Hawking radiation thus
suggests that 5D gravitational waves will be emitted from this
region into the bulk, the typical wavelength of the emitted waves
being of the order of FORMULA .Note that for large FORMULA  black holes,
the quasinormal modes have wavelength FORMULA  with
FORMULA  the horizon radius {{cite:a2f69873-7cd8-4d43-8d98-ea5b7ddf82fd}}. For large black
holes we have that FORMULA , and so the
(local) energy of the KK modes is large, corresponding to the
emission of “heavy” gravitons as in
{{cite:92b6478c-fbac-4316-bafb-c230cc420020}}.Standard arguments
{{cite:025570b8-6206-4254-9203-f58c639f7738}} concerning the suppression of bulk radiation
due to small function overlap between the localized brane black hole
and the emitted bulk modes should not apply. We do not consider here
effects due to rotation {{cite:7235a3f0-3c55-4f29-bb7b-e3fe42dc9391}}. These modes
correspond to the near-horizon `transplanckian' CFT modes in the
original derivation by Hawking. In our context, being the dual CFT
cutoff at energies FORMULA  it is not clear what they correspond to,
since we would need to know its UV completion
{{cite:f7d5bb3e-ba38-404e-b94b-7dbc538f986c}}.Transplanckian effects are
expected to be suppressed, for large black holes, by some positive
power of FORMULA . We thank R. Emparan and N. Kaloper for
discussion on these points.
A suggestive possibility is the one envisaged in figure REF :
bulk massive modes emitted from the region
FORMULA  will
come back to the brane just above FORMULA . In
the dual theory, the natural interpretation would be that of CFT
modes tunneling through the horizon, as described in {{cite:eb9a4c72-dfed-4152-90ff-1086764bd582}}. It
was already suggested in {{cite:fe1cd2de-67ec-4326-85f5-4d88ad0fba51}} that gravitational waves
traveling between two points on the brane through a null geodesics
in the bulk can appear to travel faster than light. If so, from the
brane point of view, this would justify the “leakage” of the dual
CFT modes through the horizon. It remains to be seen whether such
process really takes place or not in the actual time-dependent
solution.In a brane cosmological setting, gravitons
leaving the brane to the bulk and then bouncing back to the brane
have been shown to be present in the case of a bulk 5D Vaidya-AdS
black hole in
{{cite:a023a339-dc86-47f3-9f9e-e05a2fe41981}}.
FIGURE 
Finally, we wish to show that for the full black string (REF )
the boundary effect described in this paper disappears. Indeed, in
this case the dual CFT lives in the boundary at infinity of AdS with
no gravity. This is achieved by letting the brane position
FORMULA . The boundary projection of our
results (REF ) and (REF ) (or (REF )) gives, for
this case, FORMULA  and FORMULA  (i.e. no
“evaporation” in the boundary theory and, consequently, no
“horizon splitting” effect). This is closely related to our choice
FORMULA  made in (REF ) to get (REF ). This is a
qualitative difference with respect to the GL instability, which
always holds irrespective of whether the brane is present or not.

Conclusions
To sum up briefly the results presented in this paper,
holographic arguments applied to the propagation of bulk massive
modes in the RS2 black string (REF ), namely our results
(REF ) and (REF ), led us to conjecture some of the
basic features of the actual time dependent solution describing an
evaporating black hole on the brane, its horizon structure
and the possible classical bulk dual of the tunneling
mechanism for Hawking radiation (fig. REF ).
