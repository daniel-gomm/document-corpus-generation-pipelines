The inelastic neutron scattering spectrum
in cuprate superconductors
is discussed on the basis of
the itinerant-localized duality model for strongly correlated electrons.
In Appendix
the consistency with recent rigorous theoretical result on ARPES is discussed.

New experimental findings have been continuously brought
by inelastic neutron scattering
in cuprate superconductors.
In recent years the spin excitation at higher energies
than the resonance energy has been intensively discussed{{cite:c0338059-a6e7-4ee0-97c3-89531e9dccde}}.
For optimally doped LaFORMULA SrCuOFORMULA 
the spectral intensity in FORMULA -FORMULA  space
has been established experimentally{{cite:5adf704e-1f7f-407b-84a6-a57ef0937500}}.
In the following
we give a phenomenological description
of this completely established spectrum
on the basis of the itinerant-localized duality model{{cite:af0a72a7-8931-4a1a-ad22-8d4b2389e78c}}.
In the study of cuprate superconductors
the duality model is effective to understand
“pseudogap" and “spin-charge separation" anomalies{{cite:af0a72a7-8931-4a1a-ad22-8d4b2389e78c}}
in the normal phase.
Especially the “pseudogap" phenomena
are understood as a spectral-weight transfer{{cite:af0a72a7-8931-4a1a-ad22-8d4b2389e78c}}, {{cite:a4bc623e-2ad4-40cb-a5ce-188dcbe5fe49}}, {{cite:ca622ee2-0647-4c2f-9ac4-b3a24a093631}}, {{cite:9e45616a-374c-4ee2-911f-7eddae6d03ac}}, {{cite:ace77a0a-8e4f-4e99-9a64-8b32eb6f52a1}}
from itinerant to localized degrees of freedom.
Such a spectral weight transfer is missed
in the standard spin-fluctuation theory{{cite:8028e4d6-ae3f-4f21-81f1-0a7adc852d96}}
where the magnetically ordered phase is metallic.
Since the ordered phase is the Mott insulator
in the case of cuprates,
the itinerant spectral weight
representing the metallic component
should vanish
approaching the Mott transition
and the spectral weight transfer
from low-energy itinerant
to high-energy localized spectral weights
is inevitable.
Above mentioned localized part
representing the sloppy spin-wave{{cite:9e45616a-374c-4ee2-911f-7eddae6d03ac}}, {{cite:ace77a0a-8e4f-4e99-9a64-8b32eb6f52a1}} is
the spin excitation at higher energies
than the resonance energy{{cite:c0338059-a6e7-4ee0-97c3-89531e9dccde}}, {{cite:5adf704e-1f7f-407b-84a6-a57ef0937500}}.
This localized part is converted to the spin-wave spectrum
in the Mott insulator.
The itinerant-localized crossover{{cite:a4bc623e-2ad4-40cb-a5ce-188dcbe5fe49}}, {{cite:ca622ee2-0647-4c2f-9ac4-b3a24a093631}}, {{cite:6fe648cf-71bf-451e-8b9a-c9f919e41db0}}
resulting from the spectral weight transfer
is observed experimentally{{cite:76d50e87-b7f4-4e29-83f6-72463093704d}}.
The pseudogap at lowest temperature or lowest energy
should be ascribed to the superconducting fluctuations{{cite:76d50e87-b7f4-4e29-83f6-72463093704d}}.
Appendix
Summary of Appendix
In his recent review article
Kohno has summarized a unified understanding
of the single-particle excitation spectrum near the Mott transition.
It seems that his work gives a rigorous support
to previous studies based on the sloppy spin-wave in the metallic state.
Introduction
In his recent review article {{cite:76ee8966-1011-42eb-8104-5bed245dcbee}}
Kohno gives a detailed explanation of the single-particle excitation spectrum
near the Mott transition in a unified manner
based on the exact results for the Hubbard model.
Although he explains various aspects of the spectrum,
I think that the most important finding is
the existence of the spectrum related to the spin-wave in the insulating state.
Primary: spin excitation
In strongly correlated electron systems
the charge excitation is suppressed
so that the spin excitation becomes dominant in the low-energy region.
The salient feature of the spin-excitation spectrum near the Mott transition
is the presence of the sloppy spin-wave.
This spin-wave is described by the localized component
of the itinerant-localized duality model.
The spectral weight is transferred
from the itinerant component to the localized component
approaching the Mott transition.
This spectral-weight transfer is observed
as the pseudo-gap of the spin-excitation spectrum.
At the Mott transition
the itinerant component vanishes so that only the localized component remains.
The elementary excitation of the remaining localized component is the spin-wave.
The remnant of the spin-wave survives
in the metallic state near the Mott insulator.
This point is confirmed both theoretically and experimentally
as discussed in the main text of this note.
Secondary: single-particle excitation
Once the spin-excitation spectrum is established as mentioned above,
the calculation of the single-particle excitation spectrum is the secondary task.
Such a task is performed by many authors {{cite:81b24ff1-ed2d-4467-9fab-a48e86ecc267}}.
The spectral weight of the sloppy spin-wave in FORMULA -space
is reflected in the single-particle spectral weight in FORMULA -space
via the coupling between these two excitations.
It seems that Kohno's work is consistent with
and gives a rigorous support to previous developments.
Conclusion of Appendix
Consequently we can conclude
that the sloppy spin-wave in the metallic state
is the key ingredient to understand the Mott transition.
