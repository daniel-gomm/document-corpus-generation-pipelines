The strong degeneracy of the FORMULA C ignition layer on an accreting neutron star results in a hydrodynamic thermonuclear runaway, in which the nuclear heating time becomes shorter than the local dynamical time. We model the resulting combustion wave during these superbursts as an upward propagating detonation. We solve the reactive fluid flow and show that the detonation propagates through the deepest layers of fuel and drives a shock wave that steepens as it travels upward into lower density material. The shock is sufficiently strong upon reaching the freshly accreted H/He layer that it triggers unstable FORMULA He burning if the superburst occurs during the latter half of the regular Type I bursting cycle; this is likely the origin of the bright Type I precursor bursts observed at the onset of superbursts. The cooling of the outermost shock-heated layers produces a bright, FORMULA , flash that precedes the Type I burst by a few seconds; this may be the origin of the spike seen at the burst onset in 4U 1820-30 and 4U 1636-54, the only two bursts observed with RXTE at high time resolution. The dominant products of the FORMULA C detonation are FORMULA Si, FORMULA S, and FORMULA Ar. Gupta et al. showed that a crust composed of such intermediate mass elements has a larger heat flux than one composed of iron-peak elements and helps bring the superburst ignition depth into better agreement with values inferred from observations.

Introduction
Superbursts are powered by unstable thermonuclear burning on the surface of an accreting neutron star in a low mass X-ray binary (for reviews, see {{cite:a6db7b47-92ed-4745-9235-ce6af45a7f99}}, {{cite:a72c162b-2cbf-4e02-97ab-fe12303bf58a}}, {{cite:418b2ffa-4fd4-4701-b496-f6643fc144bb}}). Their recurrence time (FORMULA ) and duration (FORMULA ) suggest ignition densities of FORMULA  {{cite:55a5c52d-1af0-48a0-a504-4941f4354d1a}}, FORMULA  times larger than that of normal Type I X-ray bursts. If the superburst fuel is FORMULA C {{cite:2c18bb9d-042e-438b-978b-b7175e2bcf1a}}, {{cite:7bb76756-3a85-4c03-8a96-6ec47f6964d7}}, then the observed energy release (FORMULA ) implies a FORMULA C mass fraction FORMULA  in the matter accumulated from Type I bursts {{cite:55a5c52d-1af0-48a0-a504-4941f4354d1a}}.
Previous studies assumed the entire layer of FORMULA C fuel burns instantly and hydrostatically, and obtained a good match to the late-time (FORMULA ) light curves and accounted for the quenching of normal bursts in the days following a superburst {{cite:2c18bb9d-042e-438b-978b-b7175e2bcf1a}}, {{cite:7bb76756-3a85-4c03-8a96-6ec47f6964d7}}, {{cite:45fd08c3-e764-414b-8c35-11ad47782336}}, {{cite:f26b9e93-20c3-4261-b16c-f877b94a2481}}, {{cite:55a5c52d-1af0-48a0-a504-4941f4354d1a}}. They did not, however, fit the early-time light curves nor provide a mechanism to trigger the Type I bursts that precede superbursts by FORMULA . Such precursor bursts have been found in all five cases in which the onset of the superburst was observed (4U1820-30: {{cite:7bb76756-3a85-4c03-8a96-6ec47f6964d7}}; 4U 1636-54: {{cite:1e9c2fe0-da01-4faf-81fe-567dd29d51c7}}; KS 1731-26: {{cite:e17fe8ae-1353-40db-8fee-64dd65b25607}}; 4U 1254-69: {{cite:d884587e-3792-4cd6-9890-2ffbfc05f0f3}}; GX 17+2: {{cite:156c5b62-cbb7-4fa1-80e9-c8d15f473fc3}}).
In Weinberg, Bildsten, & Brown (2006; hereafter WBB), we showed that the strong degeneracy of the superburst ignition layer results in a hydrodynamic thermonuclear runaway, in which the heating time FORMULA  becomes shorter than the local dynamical time FORMULA , where FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA  are the temperature, pressure scale height, and sound speed at the base of the burning layer. We start in §  by describing the conditions for the spontaneous initiation of a detonation, and show that the observed superbursts are likely deep enough into the neutron star that their plane-parallel burning will initiate a detonation. We thus model the hydrodynamic combustion wave that forms once FORMULA  as a detonation, showing its impact on the overlying surface layers.
We show (§ ) that as the detonation propagates upward, it drives an outgoing shock wave that steepens as it travels into lower density material. When the shock impacts the freshly accreted H/He layer, its overpressure is FORMULA . Our calculations (§ ) suggest that about half the time there is enough H/He present in the layer that the shock can ignite the FORMULA He and trigger a Type I precursor burst. We compute full light curves in §  and show that a detonation with a shock-triggered Type I burst can explain features of the early-time light curves while still accounting for the late-time behavior. We also show that the cooling of the outermost shock-heated layers results in a bright, sub-second, flash that precedes the precursor by a few seconds. This could be the origin of the spike seen at the burst onset in 4U1820-30 and 4U 1636-54, the only two bursts observed with RXTE at high time resolution.
We show in §  that even if the shock does not ignite the FORMULA He, the cooling of the ashes of FORMULA C burning at depths just below the H/He layer can result in a precursor that appears similar to a Type I burst, but with a peak luminosity that is smaller by a factor of FORMULA . This may explain why three out of the five precursor bursts were only about half as bright as the ordinary Type I bursts {{cite:a6db7b47-92ed-4745-9235-ce6af45a7f99}}, {{cite:55a5c52d-1af0-48a0-a504-4941f4354d1a}}.

Hydrodynamic Carbon Burning
After the thermally unstable ignition of FORMULA C, there is an hour-long convective stage where the energy generation rate from FORMULA C burning, FORMULA , is sufficiently small that the heating time FORMULA  is much longer than the eddy turnover time FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the typical velocity of a convective cell (WBB). For low FORMULA C ignition depths (i.e., low densities) or initial FORMULA C mass fractions FORMULA , the FORMULA C completely burns in this convective stage, and hydrostatics describes all stages of burning (just as with FORMULA He burning during Type I X-ray bursts; {{cite:02f5cd58-79d4-4adb-8b14-740757a3b0b9}}).
However, for larger FORMULA C ignition depths FORMULA  (ignition densitiesAssuming a relativistic degenerate electron gas, the density at the base is FORMULA  where FORMULA  is the gravity, FORMULA  is the electron fraction, and FORMULA . FORMULA ) and FORMULA , FORMULA  becomes so large that FORMULA  and convection becomes inefficient at transporting the energy release outward (FORMULA  when FORMULA  for FORMULA , FORMULA ; WBB). As a result, the fuel is rapidly consumed within a thin layer near the base in a local thermonuclear runaway, during which time FORMULA  becomes shorter than the dynamical time FORMULA  and hydrodynamic burning begins. The transition from FORMULA  to FORMULA  only requires a FORMULA % increase in temperature (WBB). We calculate the minimum heating time FORMULA  using the estimate in WBB (equation [5]) and in Figure REF  plot the relation between FORMULA  and FORMULA  where FORMULA . Ignitions above this line will become hydrodynamic.
The only direct information we have about FORMULA  and FORMULA  is that derived by {{cite:55a5c52d-1af0-48a0-a504-4941f4354d1a}} from fits to six observed superburst light curves. These are plotted in Figure REF  assuming a 30% uncertainty in the distance to each source (corresponding to the uncertainty in the distance to 4U 1254-690, the only one of the six sources with a reported best fit distance with error bars).The light curves constrain the nuclear energy release FORMULA . To estimate FORMULA  we assume FORMULA  corresponding to FORMULA C burning to FORMULA Fe. As we show in § REF , however, the FORMULA C may only burn to FORMULA Si, in which case FORMULA  is larger by FORMULA . The measured values of FORMULA  and FORMULA  suggest that the FORMULA C likely burns hydrodynamically. We argue in § REF  that a possible (but by no means proven) outcome is a spontaneous initiation that leads to a propagating detonation.
FIGURE 
Spontaneous Initiation of a Detonation
Even for chemical combustion in gases, it remains challenging to theoretically predict the conditions needed for a spontaneous detonation {{cite:1bca0d93-ebcc-48bc-bf78-0dda673ba544}}, {{cite:1fcdba82-5bcd-408e-a260-fd873deec810}}, {{cite:febb2e92-986d-497f-9ad8-66095539acd0}}. However, a widely accepted criteria for initially addressing the question is the requirement that a sufficiently large volume (defined below) burn in less than a sound crossing time {{cite:4ec1e71c-11d3-418e-9359-62b6fed69bd9}}, {{cite:e1f807e0-ce8d-4080-9ab8-8be2313e1cfe}}, {{cite:dc33a8f3-e063-4c9e-94b3-b93ce1d2df5d}}, {{cite:363dd1ec-40bc-43c8-bc50-56a76cc3a269}}, {{cite:bbea1491-3b21-4ee3-a0a8-35f94b564255}}.
We first estimate the size of the region that burns in less than a sound crossing time. According to the Zel'dovich criterion (see {{cite:ffcf6cb5-5579-4a59-9544-f88944617f9a}} for an updated discussion), such burning requires a spatial region where the temperature gradient is so shallow that nearly simultaneous runaways can occur. The quantitative criterion is that the phase speed of the burning FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the time scale for the acceleration of nuclear burning and FORMULA  at FORMULA . We first evaluate this in the vertical direction assuming an adiabatic temperature gradient at the moment when FORMULA , which occurs at FORMULA  (we integrate over the entire convective region when computing FORMULA ; see Figure 1 and equation [3] in WBB). Since the heat capacity is determined mainly by the electrons, FORMULA  {{cite:2c18bb9d-042e-438b-978b-b7175e2bcf1a}}, and thus FORMULA . Requiring that FORMULA  then implies
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  is the adiabatic index. At runaway FORMULA , and FORMULA  between the base and a height
FORMULA 
Above that location, the temperature is not adequate to help initiate the detonation. Of course, because of the small scale height compared to the radius, there is a much smaller temperature gradient in the horizontal direction, an issue we will address momentarily.
If the initiating region calculated above is too small, the initial shock is unable to trigger further burning before it decays by geometrical dilution. Direct numerical simulations and experiments always find that to trigger a detonation the initiating region must be a few orders of magnitude longer than the induction length of the detonation FORMULA  (see {{cite:8cfc6fe9-a8de-47e6-acca-5f52ad29b6a2}} for a recent discussion). Here FORMULA  is the Chapman-Jouguet velocity (see e.g., {{cite:c0398f38-623e-4298-9cee-1004a09eb0f2}}) and FORMULA  is the induction time, the time scale to complete the burning behind the shock. In the case of a spherically symmetric ignition (see {{cite:d69ad869-8bda-4960-bc14-ea72a0d0c62d}}), such as in a centrally ignited Type Ia supernova, this minimum distance is expressed in terms of a maximum radius of curvature FORMULA  {{cite:877159b2-da90-4fa6-97cf-1b6119d1db57}}, {{cite:921f9627-9e10-4581-be0f-19731c2c076e}}. {{cite:921f9627-9e10-4581-be0f-19731c2c076e}} carried out direct numerical simulations for carbon detonations, and derived a fitting function for FORMULA . The most conservative estimate of the critical conditions needed for a detonation is to then demand that the vertical length of the spontaneously igniting region, FORMULA , be larger than FORMULA . By equation (REF ), this translates into a requirement that FORMULA , as plotted in Figure REF . Most of the data lie below this line, making it challenging to trigger a spherical detonation by a vertical initiation.
Building on the arguments for Type Ia supernovae core detonations, our discussion has assumed that the vertical temperature gradient (where the temperature decreases by FORMULA  over a pressure scale height FORMULA ) plays the critical role. However, the superburst occurs in a thin shell at the surface of the neutron star, and the hour long convective phase prior to the hydrodynamic runaway should be adequate to establish transverse temperature gradients smaller than the vertical gradient. Only a numerical anelastic calculation could accurately calculate such a gradient, but we think it reasonable to assume that the initiation length is larger in the plane, potentially exceeding FORMULA  at some location. Such a cylindrical geometry also has the advantage of less severe geometrical dilution, where all analytic calculations yield a factor of two smaller value for FORMULA  {{cite:1bca0d93-ebcc-48bc-bf78-0dda673ba544}}, {{cite:d69ad869-8bda-4960-bc14-ea72a0d0c62d}}. For this reason, we plot an additional line at FORMULA  in Figure REF , representing our current best guess of the constraint for detonation initiation in a planar geometry. All the data points are above this line, as is the explosion we are simulating in this paper (shown by the open star). Although more work clearly remains to fully assess the onset of a detonation in a planar geometry after a long convective phase, we will proceed assuming that it can happen.

Numerical Method
We assume a plane parallel geometry with constant gravity FORMULA  (corresponding to FORMULA , FORMULA ) and treat the detonation in only the vertical direction, parametrized by the column depth FORMULA  into the star (units of FORMULA ), where FORMULA . Modeling the lateral propagation is important and left for future study (see {{cite:ba4cbfff-7dd3-4973-9c40-86ded0a4bf9a}}, who consider a laterally propagating FORMULA He detonation in the ocean of a neutron star). We solve the reactive fluid flow equations using a one-dimensional, explicit, Lagrangian, finite difference scheme (see e.g., {{cite:34951123-1f28-415c-a555-16d1e6cb2e0f}}). We use operator splitting to couple the hydrodynamics to a nuclear energy generation network. The network contains 13 isotopes: FORMULA He, FORMULA C, FORMULA O, FORMULA Ne, FORMULA Mg, FORMULA Si, FORMULA S, FORMULA Ar, FORMULA Ca, FORMULA Ti, FORMULA Cr, FORMULA Fe, FORMULA NiFORMULA , and includes FORMULA -chain, heavy-ion, and FORMULA  reactionsWe use F. Timmes' network solver “public_aprox13.f", kindly made available online at http://www.cococubed.com/code_pages/net_aprox13.shtml (see also {{cite:9a3db468-852a-4c50-899b-7776630fee19}}).. We assume electrons, ions, and photons supply the pressure and calculate the equation of state, volumetric neutrino emissivity, and thermal conductivity, as in {{cite:03ad249c-8e3c-428c-b8c2-894527f4d776}}.
We model the detonation and shocks over the column depths FORMULA  using 4000 grid points spaced uniformly in FORMULA . The FORMULA C layer spans the range FORMULA . The depth of the base of the freshly accreted H/He layer, FORMULA , varies linearly with the phase FORMULA  of the Type I burst cycle, whose recurrence time FORMULA . We assume the accreted gas has a solar composition and consider local accretion rates per unit area in the range FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the local Eddington accretion rate (i.e., roughly the range inferred from observations; {{cite:a6db7b47-92ed-4745-9235-ce6af45a7f99}}). The FORMULA C layer has a mass fraction FORMULA  of FORMULA Fe and for FORMULA  the composition is pure FORMULA Fe. For a given FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA , we solve for the crustal heat flux that results in unstable ignition at FORMULA  (see WBB) and then calculate FORMULA  as in {{cite:3638d849-64a0-4789-8d57-fc9cbf710f32}}.
The shock reaches the top of our grid (FORMULA ) at a time  FORMULAFORMULA  after the onset of the hydrodynamic runaway. The underlying layers are adiabatically expanding at FORMULA , though they remain bound to the neutron star and in plane parallel (see § REF ). We assume that for FORMULA  the flow remains adiabatic and that after a few dynamical times (tens of FORMULA ), the shocked layers settle into a new, puffed-up, hydrostatic equilibrium, with an entropy profile given by that at FORMULA . This post-shock hydrostatic equilibrium sets the early-time light curve of our cooling calculations (§ ).

Upward propagating detonation
FIGURE 
We compute the evolution during the convective stage (FORMULA ) as in WBB. Approximately 30% of the FORMULA C is burned to FORMULA Mg during the convective stage for FORMULA  and a pre-ignition mass fraction FORMULA . We then initiate the detonation at the onset of the dynamical runaway (FORMULA ) by increasing the temperature of the grid point at FORMULA  by 1%. In Figure REF  we show the evolution of the thermal profile during the convective stage as FORMULA  rises (dashed lines) and the hydrodynamic stage as the detonation propagates outward (solid lines).
The shock wave that defines the head of the detonation front is sufficiently strong that it triggers complete FORMULA C burning in the deepest layers. However, as the shock propagates outward into cooler, lower density fuel, it fails to trigger FORMULA C burning on the hydrodynamic timescale (FORMULA ). The shock ultimately races ahead of the burning and the detonation dies at a depth FORMULA  (see dotted line in Figure REF ). The value of FORMULA  is approximately the depth at which the detonation induction length FORMULA  becomes greater than a scale height FORMULA  (this assumes the detonation is very nearly planar upon reaching this depth; see discussion in § REF ).
FIGURE 
We now estimate how FORMULA  depends on the ignition parameters. The detonation Mach number FORMULA  and is close to the Chapman-Jouguet value FORMULA , where FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA  {{cite:9a2f66cf-84b0-497b-a0c6-0c60f1e1e55e}}. Since FORMULA , the minimum nuclear heating time (WBB), we have FORMULA , so that FORMULA  when FORMULA . In WBB we derived an estimate of the depth FORMULA  where FORMULA  becomes greater than FORMULA ; thus FORMULA , which gives
FORMULA 
In Figure REF  we show the composition profile after traversal of the shock in the detonation region FORMULA  for FORMULA . We find that for FORMULA  and FORMULA , the dominant products of burning are the intermediate mass elements FORMULA Si and FORMULA S. For FORMULA , the dominant products are FORMULA Si and FORMULA S in the top half of the detonation layer's mass and FORMULA Ni in the bottom half. As we discuss in § , the increased crustal heat flux from a crust composed of FORMULA Si and FORMULA S can help bring the superburst ignition depth into better agreement with values inferred from observations {{cite:263e75d4-7fe4-4e1e-a0e6-31460af0418b}}.
We also show in Figure REF  the magnitude of the nuclear energy release in the detonation FORMULA  and the change in internal energy of the material within the detonation region FORMULA . Here FORMULA , the difference between the internal energy, FORMULA , upon hydrostatic settling after the detonation passes, and the internal energy, FORMULA , at runaway. Thus, a fraction FORMULA  of the nuclear energy release is used to power the upward and downward propagating shock. The downward propagating shock is weak (FORMULA ) and will penetrate to great depths before dissipating. However, the total energy deposited FORMULA , the energy per nucleon released in the crust from pycnonuclear and electron capture reactions. Thus, the shock is not a significant source of crustal heating.
The boundary at FORMULA  between the hot ashes and the overlying unburned FORMULA C fuel is convectively unstable. All the FORMULA C between FORMULA  will ultimately burn in a convective deflagration, perhaps to iron-peak elements (§ ). Nonetheless, the contrast persists for more than a dynamical time and thus does not affect the upward propagating shock.

Steepening of upward propagating shock
In Figures REF  and REF  we show the evolution of the temperature profile and shock overpressure FORMULA  as the shock propagates upward (and downward). WBB showed that as the shock travels down the density gradient it steepens as FORMULA . Within the detonation region (FORMULA ) we have FORMULA . This energy release powers an upward and downward propagating shock such that for FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
where the factor of FORMULA  in the first expression accounts for the two shocks. The numerical estimate assumes a relativistic degenerate electron gas within the detonation region with FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the Fermi energy, and FORMULA . Thus, FORMULA  upon reaching the H/He layer at FORMULA .
When the shock impacts the density discontinuity at the H/He—ash/C interface FORMULA , a rarefaction wave forms and reflects back downward into the previously shocked material (see e.g., the curve labeled  FORMULAFORMULA  in Figure REF ). The upward propagating shock weakens slightly (FORMULA  decreases by FORMULA ) and a steep temperature gradient forms at FORMULA . However, despite the steepness of the gradient, the fluid is not convectively unstable because the interface's initial density contrast is maintained in the shock's wake.
FIGURE 
The dashed-dotted line in Figure REF  shows the temperature profile after passage of the shock and hydrostatic readjustment. Since FORMULA  is small for FORMULA , these layers barely need to expand and cool in order to regain hydrostatic equilibrium. By contrast, the shock is strong for FORMULA  and these layers expand and cool significantly. In §  we show that the cooling of the region FORMULA  results in a brief (FORMULA ), bright, flash that precedes the precursor burst by several seconds. The duration of the flash is determined by the hydrostatic temperature profile in this region, which we find is nearly isothermal for the following reason. The layer is initially radiative FORMULA , and the shock is gas pressure-dominated, FORMULA . Thus, equation (REF ) gives FORMULA . The layer then adiabatically expands from FORMULA  back to FORMULA  (the layer always remains plane-parallel) and the temperature decreases to a hydrostatic value that varies weakly with depth FORMULA .
Near the top of our grid, the shock becomes radiation pressure dominated with a post-shock temperature FORMULA . The diffusion time of the photons generated in the shock FORMULA  is larger than the shock propagation time FORMULA  as long as FORMULA , where the opacity FORMULA . Thus, photons do not preheat the gas ahead of the shock until FORMULA  and radiative transport can be neglected over the range of our shock calculation.
For a strong shock, FORMULA . In the radiative outer layers FORMULA  so that FORMULA , where FORMULA  and we used (REF ). Since the neutron star escape speed FORMULA , the shock ejects only the outermost layers FORMULA .
FIGURE 

Hydrogen and Helium Burning
As the shock propagates through the upper layers, it deposits considerable entropy. In § REF  we show that if the superburst occurs during the latter half of the Type I bursting cycle, there is enough FORMULA He present in the H/He layer that the shock triggers unstable FORMULA He burning. The FORMULA He is consumed within only a few seconds and, as we show in § REF , this rapid energy release results in a nearly Eddington-limited Type I burst. In § REF  we show that if the superburst occurs during the first half of the cycle, the FORMULA He still burns, but only in a thermally stable manner, over a duration of FORMULA . Such stable FORMULA He burning does not result in a Type I burst because the FORMULA He is consumed so slowly that the heat flux from burning never gets very high (though we show that stable rp-process H burning may increase the flux considerably).
Shock-Triggered Unstable Helium Burning
The shock will trigger unstable FORMULA He burning only if the base of the FORMULA He layer is thermally unstable after settling into its post-shock hydrostatic configuration. This is because the shocked layers hydrostatically settle within only a few dynamical times (FORMULA ). By contrast, the heating timescale from unstable FORMULA He burning at these depths is always greater than FORMULA  (see e.g., {{cite:02f5cd58-79d4-4adb-8b14-740757a3b0b9}}).
In Figure REF  we show the hydrostatic post-shock FORMULA He ignition curve as a function of FORMULA  at FORMULA . We define ignition according to the one-zone thermal instability criterion FORMULA  ({{cite:7cb32f91-5230-483f-892a-d0fd8a44ae87}}, {{cite:d701f0c6-2650-4ea0-87d4-21dbeaa6e275}}, {{cite:3638d849-64a0-4789-8d57-fc9cbf710f32}}), where FORMULA  is the triple-alpha energy generation rate (we use that from {{cite:d701f0c6-2650-4ea0-87d4-21dbeaa6e275}}) and FORMULA  is an approximation to the local cooling rate for a thermal conductivity FORMULA . To the right of the ignition curve FORMULA  and burning is unstable. The three curves are for different local accretion rates per unit area FORMULA , in units of the local Eddington rate FORMULA . The lower the FORMULA , the larger the FORMULA He abundance at FORMULA  {{cite:3638d849-64a0-4789-8d57-fc9cbf710f32}}, and hence the lower the FORMULA  threshold for ignition. If the last Type I burst was too recent (i.e., the phase, and thus FORMULA , is too small), there is no value of FORMULA  capable of triggering unstable burning since at low densities cooling is always faster than heating {{cite:7cb32f91-5230-483f-892a-d0fd8a44ae87}}. If FORMULA  is too large, FORMULA He burning is always stable and will not produce a Type I burst; however, such a strong shock is unlikely since it requires FORMULA  and a superburst early in the Type I burst cycle.
For a FORMULA C detonation at FORMULA , the shock is sufficiently strong to trigger unstable FORMULA He burning for the latter FORMULA % of the burst cycle. If a less massive layer of FORMULA He is present, a Type I burst will not be triggered.
A precursor has been seen in each of the five cases where the onset of the burst was detected, and it is unlikely that all are due to shock-triggered FORMULA He burning. However, as we describe in § , some of the observed precursors may not be due to unstable FORMULA He burning but rather to FORMULA C burning at depths just below FORMULA . Furthermore, we may be underestimating the fraction of superbursts that trigger unstable FORMULA He burning for two reasons. First, the H/He layer may be more He-rich than our calculations assume, especially at higher FORMULA . This is because superbursts tend to occur in systems with large values of FORMULA  (1000), the ratio of the time-averaged persistent to burst luminosity {{cite:402c0234-2c8b-499f-abea-5e798c80d786}}. The Type I bursts in these systems also tend to be of short-duration, consistent with a pure FORMULA He flash. On the other hand, the large FORMULA  values may also indicate that most of the FORMULA He is burning stably {{cite:62ec7f45-343c-4f89-a241-4fde46a096df}}, {{cite:f26b9e93-20c3-4261-b16c-f877b94a2481}}, {{cite:16a7da81-9e65-42af-95fc-d6e15934693d}}, and it is not clear how a shock would trigger a transition from stable to unstable burning. Second, if a convective FORMULA C deflagration propagates outward from FORMULA  and reaches FORMULA , it may also trigger unstable FORMULA He burning. Such a deflagration would propagate at roughly the turbulent speed FORMULA  (cf. {{cite:dfb64686-28d3-4484-9a58-b47dc759005f}}) and reach the FORMULA He layer a few milliseconds after the shock.
FIGURE 

Stable Hydrogen and Helium Burning
FIGURE 
If the shock does not trigger unstable FORMULA He burning, the H and FORMULA He still burn in a stable manner due to the large heat flux from the ashes of FORMULA C burning below. We account for three sources of stable burning: hot CNO burning FORMULA  (we assume the initial mass fraction of CNO nuclei is FORMULA ), triple-alpha FORMULA He burning FORMULA , and H burning via the rapid proton capture (rp) process FORMULA  of {{cite:8afe2504-bfd1-484e-9569-e12fb11a75af}}. The evolution of stable H and FORMULA He burning during the first FORMULA  following hydrostatic settling is shown in the top panel of Figure REF .
To calculate FORMULA , note that after hydrostatic settling the temperature and density at the base of the H/He layer FORMULA  are FORMULA  and FORMULA . The primary breakout reaction from the hot CNO cycle is therefore FORMULA  {{cite:4c47f3a3-f4dd-46d5-9988-f346c57467c9}}.Due to the heat flux from the ashes of FORMULA C burning, the temperature at FORMULA  reaches FORMULA  just FORMULA  after hydrostatic settling. At this temperature, a second hot CNO cycle emerges that includes FORMULA Ne {{cite:4a954490-21a9-4232-8a9c-874c201e4d7f}}, and the primary breakout reaction may instead be FORMULA  {{cite:4c47f3a3-f4dd-46d5-9988-f346c57467c9}}. As the thermal wave from the hot ashes of FORMULA C burning diffuses through the H/He layer, the temperature at FORMULA  rapidly rises and the FORMULA Ne captures a proton before it can FORMULA  decay (FORMULA ) and return to the hot CNO cycle. A series of fast proton captures ensue until the nuclear flow reaches the first waiting point of the rp-process, FORMULA Si (FORMULA ; {{cite:9ede2a3c-411f-499c-9fa5-2c6727ece1e2}}). Energy production by rp-processing drops until higher temperatures initiate further proton and FORMULA  captures. Here we follow Wiescher et al. (1999; see also {{cite:7c2eded4-7d38-4fac-8d25-4fc95e78a5aa}}) and approximate the energy generation rate of rp-process burning by accounting for just the energy release in burning to FORMULA Si. Since FORMULA  is the slowest reaction of the sequence, it governs the total reaction rate of the flow, and

in units of FORMULA . Here FORMULA  is the energy release in burning to FORMULA Si and the FORMULA  reaction rate is from {{cite:deba0937-2194-4416-b793-d2317888b7bd}}. This approximation only allows us to place a lower-bound on the contribution of rp-process burning to the light curve; the full calculation is left for future study. Nonetheless, as the bottom panel of Figure REF  shows, it has a noticeable impact on the early time light curve and if the shock does not trigger unstable FORMULA He burning, FORMULA  over the duration of the burst.

Cooling Models and Light Curves
Following the passage of the shock and hydrostatic readjustment, a cooling wave propagates inward from the surface and the shock-heated layers begin to cool via heat diffusion,
FORMULA 
where the flux FORMULA , FORMULA  is the nuclear energy generation rate due to any remaining fuel, and FORMULA  is the neutrino energy loss rate. The light curve is set by the final burn temperature profile FORMULA , input as the initial condition of (REF ), and the heat flux from any burning FORMULA  following hydrostatic settling.
FIGURE 
Previous studies assumed FORMULA  was given by the total energy release FORMULA  assuming an instantaneous and complete isobaric FORMULA C burn between FORMULA . This gives {{cite:45fd08c3-e764-414b-8c35-11ad47782336}}, {{cite:55a5c52d-1af0-48a0-a504-4941f4354d1a}},
FORMULA 
Here we instead use the results of our time-dependent detonation calculation to determine FORMULA .
The FORMULA  term has contributions from two regions of unburned fuel: the FORMULA C between FORMULA  and the H/He at FORMULA . As noted in § REF , due to the sharp temperature gradient at FORMULA , the FORMULA C will likely burn in a convective deflagration that will reach the H/He layer a few FORMULA  after passage of the shock. For simplicity, we assume an instantaneous isobaric FORMULA C burn (approximately given by equation [REF ]) in the deflagration region FORMULA . We assume an energy release in the deflagration of FORMULA , corresponding to FORMULA C burning to FORMULA Fe with FORMULA , the fraction of fuel remaining at the onset of the runaway that follows the convective stage.
To account for H and FORMULA He burning, we adopt separate strategies depending on whether the shock triggers unstable FORMULA He burning. If the shock triggers unstable FORMULA He burning (§ REF ), the burning layer quickly becomes convective and its thermal evolution during the rise is not described by the heat diffusion equation (REF ). Instead, we solve the rise as in Weinberg et al. (2006b; here we account only for FORMULA -capture reactions), which we then superimpose onto the cooling solution. If the shock does not trigger unstable FORMULA He burning, the H and FORMULA He still burn in a stable manner (§ REF ). In this case a convective zone does not form and the thermal evolution is described by equation (REF ). We set FORMULA , the three sources of stable burning described in § REF , and solve for the rate of change of the composition FORMULA  simultaneously with the diffusion equation (see Figure REF ).
We use the method of lines to solve equation (REF ), setting FORMULA  at the outer boundary (FORMULA ) and FORMULA  (vanishing flux) at the inner boundary (FORMULA ). In Figures REF  and REF  we show the cooling for FORMULA , FORMULA , and a Type I burst phase FORMULA  and FORMULA , respectively. In the former case, the shock does not trigger unstable FORMULA He burning. The corresponding light curves are shown in Figures REF  and REF . We find that in all cases the light curve evolves through three stages: a shock breakout stage (FORMULA ; § REF ), a precursor stage (FORMULA ; § REF ), and a superburst stage (FORMULA ; § REF ).
Shock breakout
For times FORMULA  after the detonation, the cooling of the outermost shock-heated layers (FORMULA ) dominates the emission. It produces a brief (FORMULA ), bright, flash that precedes the precursor burst peak by FORMULA  and has an initial luminosity that is super-Eddington. The evolution of the temperature profile within the H/He layer during this cooling epoch is shown in the right panel of Figure REF  (lines FORMULA ). The luminosity of the flash decays as a power-law with time FORMULA , which can be understood as follows ({{cite:55a5c52d-1af0-48a0-a504-4941f4354d1a}} give a similar explanation for the superburst cooling at times FORMULA ). The cooling wave propagates inward from the surface and reaches a column depth FORMULA  at time FORMULA , the thermal timescale of the layer. For FORMULA  the atmosphere has an almost constant heat flux with depth and an approximately constant opacity FORMULA  so that FORMULA . For FORMULA  the temperature profile is nearly unchanged from its initial state FORMULA . Since initially the region FORMULA  is nearly isothermal (see § REF ), FORMULA , and since gas pressure dominates FORMULA , so that FORMULA .
FIGURE 
As the Type I burst phase FORMULA , the delay between the onset of the flash and the peak of the precursor burst increases slightly (Figure REF ) because the larger FORMULA  is, the greater FORMULA  is. As the FORMULA C ignition depth FORMULA  increases, the flash becomes more luminous (Figure REF ) because the larger FORMULA  is the larger FORMULA  is at a given depth FORMULA  (equation [REF ]), and thus the hotter the envelope is after hydrostatic settling.
While the outermost layers FORMULA  cool, the heat flux from the hot ashes of FORMULA C burning begins to diffuse outward and heat up the layer FORMULA . A steep temperature gradient develops near FORMULA  and a convective zone forms. Since we assume the energy transport is described by heat diffusion (equation [REF ]), we underestimate the efficiency of energy transport during this brief (FORMULA ) convective epoch. The delay between the peak of the shock breakout flash and the peak of the precursor burst may therefore be somewhat shorter than we have found and the valley between the peaks may not be as deep.
Unlike the unstable FORMULA He burning precursor, which might be triggered by a shock or an incident FORMULA C deflagration, the flash is perhaps a unique signature of a FORMULA C detonation. A sub-second spike is seen at the onset of the superburst in both cases in which RXTE caught the rise (4U 1820-30: {{cite:7bb76756-3a85-4c03-8a96-6ec47f6964d7}}; 4U 1636-54: {{cite:1e9c2fe0-da01-4faf-81fe-567dd29d51c7}}). In both cases, the peak of the spike precedes the peak of the precursor by FORMULA . Although consistent with the features of a shock breakout, it is possible the spike is instead just the first peak of a photospheric radius expansion burst. However, in the case of 4U 1636-54, the peak flux of the precursor is approximately 60% fainter than that of the brightest Type I bursts from this system {{cite:a6db7b47-92ed-4745-9235-ce6af45a7f99}}. This suggests that at least in 4U 1636-54, the precursor is not Eddington-limited and thus not a radius expansion burst.

Precursor burst
FIGURE 
For FORMULA , the rise and decay of the unstable FORMULA He burning precursor, and the cooling of ashes of FORMULA C burning just below FORMULA , dominate the emission. If unstable FORMULA He burning is triggered, it results in a Type I burst that begins to rise FORMULA  after the peak of the shock breakout flash. During the first FORMULA  of FORMULA He burning, a convective zone develops and moves outward from FORMULA  to lower pressure (line 3 in Figure REF ). The energy generation rate FORMULA  is so high during the initial stages of burning that the timescale for the convective zone to grow is much shorter than the thermal timescale at the convective-radiative interface. As a result, the outer radiative layers do not get heated during the first second of FORMULA He burning and the cooling wave continues to propagate inwards through the outer shock-heated layers. A steep temperature gradient develops at the convective-radiative interface due to the large compositional contrast between the FORMULA He-rich matter that is burning and the outer H-rich material {{cite:02f5cd58-79d4-4adb-8b14-740757a3b0b9}}. Eventually, the thermal time at the interface becomes shorter than the convective growth time and the convective zone slowly retreats back to the base FORMULA  (lines FORMULA  in Figure REF ). The radiative layers then finally start to heat up and the flux begins to rise, reaching a peak luminosity after several seconds.
FIGURE 
The peak luminosity of the Type I burst increases as FORMULA  and the amount of FORMULA He available to burn increases (Figure REF ). After the peak, the H/He layers cool and the thermal wave continues its inward march, gradually penetrating the ashes of FORMULA C burning (lines FORMULA  in Figure REF ).
Importantly, even if unstable FORMULA He burning is not triggered, the cooling ashes of FORMULA C burning just below FORMULA  results in a flux rise and decay that is similar in appearance to that of a Type I burst, though with a peak flux that is smaller by a factor of FORMULA . This can be seen in the FORMULA  curve of Figure REF , a case in which the shock fails to trigger unstable FORMULA He burning (also compare lines FORMULA  of Figure REF  with lines FORMULA  of Figure REF ). In this case, the Type I-like rise and decay is powered by the hot ashes of FORMULA C burning, although stable nuclear burning of H and FORMULA He also contribute, increasing the peak flux by FORMULA  (see the bottom panel of Figure REF ; this may be an underestimate since we only account for stable H burning via the rp-process up to FORMULA Si). Thus, even if there is no FORMULA He layer, if the FORMULA C at FORMULA  burns there will still be a precursor burst, albeit one that is about half as bright as an ordinary Type I burst.
In three of the five cases in which a precursor was seen, the peak flux of the precursor was smaller than the brightest of the system's ordinary bursts by a factor of FORMULA  (the exceptions are the precursor from 4U 1820-30, which looked like an ordinary burst, and 4U 1254-69 which was brighter than an ordinary burst; {{cite:a6db7b47-92ed-4745-9235-ce6af45a7f99}}, {{cite:55a5c52d-1af0-48a0-a504-4941f4354d1a}}). It is thus possible that some of the observed precursors are not the result of unstable FORMULA He burning.

Late-time light curve
For FORMULA , the light curve is powered by the continued inward propagation of the cooling wave into the ashes beneath FORMULA  (see Figure REF , lines FORMULA ). As {{cite:45fd08c3-e764-414b-8c35-11ad47782336}} showed, the light curve decays as a broken power-law, with the break marking the time when the cooling wave first reaches FORMULA ; the deeper FORMULA  is, the later the break (Figure REF ). Our final temperature profile FORMULA  in the detonation region FORMULA  is only slightly steeper than the profile in the isobaric deflagration region FORMULA . Thus, our computed light curves at times FORMULA  are similar to those of {{cite:45fd08c3-e764-414b-8c35-11ad47782336}}, who assumed an isobaric burn throughout.
Here, as in previous studies, the calculated slope of the pre-break light curve (FORMULA ) is steeper than the observed slope (see e.g., Figure 6 of {{cite:55a5c52d-1af0-48a0-a504-4941f4354d1a}}). The emission during this epoch is powered by the cooling of the deflagration-heated region FORMULA , and in order to better match the observations, FORMULA  in this region must be steeper than we have assumed. Indeed, since the deflagration is likely to be highly turbulent due to the strong gravity and the hour-long convective churning that precedes the runaway, our assumption of a complete isobaric burn may not be correct. The deflagration may instead leave behind increasingly large pockets of unburned fuel as it accelerates down the density gradient, thereby yielding the steepened temperature gradient implied by the observed light curve.

Summary and Conclusions
We modeled the hydrodynamic FORMULA C combustion wave that forms during a superburst as a detonation. We found that the detonation propagates through the deepest layers and drives a shock wave that steepens as it travels upward. Upon reaching the H/He layer, the shock is sufficiently strong that it triggers unstable FORMULA He burning if the superburst occurs during the latter half of the Type I burst cycle. We showed that the light curve that results from a shock-triggered FORMULA He burn is similar to that of a normal Type I burst. The main difference is that the peak luminosity is somewhat smaller than an ordinary burst's if the superburst occurs early in the second half of the Type I cycle, when there is less FORMULA He present.
A precursor burst has been found in each of the five cases where the onset of the superburst was observed. Given our results, it is unlikely that all are due to shock-triggered unstable FORMULA He burning. It is possible that our analysis underestimates the fraction of the cycle over which the shock ignites the FORMULA He (see discussion in § ). However,
because the short thermal time at low densities results in a sharp turnover in the FORMULA He ignition curve at FORMULA , unstable FORMULA He ignition is unlikely over much more than half of the cycle, even in a layer of pure FORMULA He. A more likely explanation is that some fraction of the observed precursor bursts are due to FORMULA C burning at depths just below the H/He layer (rp-process H burning may also be stronger than we have found). We showed that the light curve of a burst in which unstable FORMULA He burning is not triggered still has a Type I-like precursor, but with a peak luminosity that is smaller by a factor of FORMULA . This may explain why the peak luminosity of three of the five observed precursors was about half as bright as the system's brightest ordinary bursts. A larger sample of precursor bursts is needed in order to better test this hypothesis.
Although we modeled the combustion wave as a detonation, the entire FORMULA C layer may instead burn in a deflagration (see § REF ). How might observations distinguish between the two modes of propagation? The late-time light curve, though well observed, is unlikely to help since at late times the cooling of the ashes of a detonation appears very similar to that of a deflagration (§ REF ). The bright precursor bursts also do not imply a detonation, as a FORMULA C deflagration may also trigger unstable FORMULA He burning when it impacts the H/He layer. Thus, perhaps the most promising signature of a detonation is the shock breakout, a bright, FORMULA , flash that precedes the precursor burst by FORMULA . This may be the origin of the spike seen at the onset of the burst rise in 4U 1820-30 and 4U 1636-54.
The superburst ignition depth is sensitive to the heat release from deep crustal reactions {{cite:03ad249c-8e3c-428c-b8c2-894527f4d776}}, {{cite:55a5c52d-1af0-48a0-a504-4941f4354d1a}}. The latter, in turn, depends on the ash composition of previous superbursts {{cite:263e75d4-7fe4-4e1e-a0e6-31460af0418b}}. Using a 13 isotope FORMULA -chain network, we found that the ashes of the detonation consist primarily of FORMULA Si, FORMULA S, and FORMULA Ar. This is potentially interesting since {{cite:263e75d4-7fe4-4e1e-a0e6-31460af0418b}} find that a crust composed of nuclei with FORMULA , as compared to FORMULA , has a larger heat flux from electron captures. It results in a significantly hotter crust and decreases the superburst ignition depth FORMULA  by a factor of FORMULA , which helps bring FORMULA  into better agreement with values inferred from observations. Further study is required as our network is small and the results likely depend on the initial composition of the ignition layer (we assumed a FORMULA C/FORMULA Fe mixture). For example, superbursts may ignite in a sea of light nuclei if most of the FORMULA C that fuels the superburst is produced in stable FORMULA He burning {{cite:62ec7f45-343c-4f89-a241-4fde46a096df}}, {{cite:f26b9e93-20c3-4261-b16c-f877b94a2481}}. Alternatively, superbursts may ignite in a sea of very heavy nuclei (FORMULA ) made during rp-process H burning {{cite:4c47f3a3-f4dd-46d5-9988-f346c57467c9}}, {{cite:b7c99007-b43a-4e5d-b8f3-348ebf8a3b3d}}. In the latter case, {{cite:bef44f3f-d22c-4aec-988f-a148ef430c01}} found that the superburst nuclear energy release is dominated by the photodisintegration of the heavy nuclei, which results in a final ash composition that instead consists primarily of iron-group elements.
