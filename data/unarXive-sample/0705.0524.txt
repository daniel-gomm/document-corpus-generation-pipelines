sufficiently general algebraic hypersurface in FORMULA ,
then any local diffeomorphism FORMULA  of simply connected
manifolds which is a FORMULA -sheeted cover away from FORMULA  has degree
FORMULA  or FORMULA  (however all degrees FORMULA  are possible if FORMULA 
fails to be a local diffeomorphism at even a single point).
In particular, any étale morphism FORMULA  of algebraic varieties which covers away from such a hypersurface FORMULA  must be birational.
Introduction
Polynomial maps FORMULA  with nonvanishing jacobian
have received much attention over the last 25 years, since the excellent expository article of Bass, Connell and Wright {{cite:3e62385c-b4a6-4ba5-a04f-ccc6c3b0d923}} pointed out that
the Jacobian Conjecture is still unsolved. The map FORMULA  has a finite degree
FORMULA  and one formulation of the conjecture asks whether necessarily FORMULA .
It is well-known that there is a Zariski open set FORMULA  for
which the restriction
FORMULA  is a FORMULA -sheet covering map {{cite:850961d4-daea-4a16-8569-981ba7e61659}}.
More recently, Jelonek has shown that if FORMULA  is the closed
set over which FORMULA  is not a FORMULA -cover, then either FORMULA  or
FORMULA  is a uniruled hypersurface {{cite:c9e5312b-937d-46c8-a8be-5acb8a2c8c73}}. He also gives a sharp degree bound for
the equation of FORMULA  and explains how to compute its equation with a Gröbner basis. Of course if FORMULA , then FORMULA  is a covering map
and simple connectivity of FORMULA  implies that FORMULA  as conjectured,
so one may study the problem in terms of the hypersurface FORMULA .
Kulikov {{cite:1c13f4a2-e6f6-45d6-b18a-db224a5b7839}} considers the more general question of whether an
étale morphism FORMULA  of simply connected varieties which is
surjective modulo codimension two must be birational, i.e. have degree FORMULA .
In terms of the divisor FORMULA  above, he observes that it is equivalent to ask whether any subgroup of FORMULA  generated by geometric generators (loops about FORMULA  with winding number one) must have index one.
The answer is yes for FORMULA , but Kulikov constructs a counterexample
for FORMULA  of degree FORMULA  by taking a quartic curve FORMULA  with three cusps and producing a subgroup FORMULA 
of index three defined by a geometric generator {{cite:1c13f4a2-e6f6-45d6-b18a-db224a5b7839}}.
We will show by contrast that for general hypersurfaces
FORMULA , FORMULA  must indeed be birational.
A hypersurface FORMULA  is given by an equation FORMULA . A theorem of Verdier says that the
corresponding map FORMULA  is a locally trivial fibration
away from a finite subset of FORMULA  {{cite:cb0606cb-178a-433e-9d0c-1e8cdcc53a63}}.
The smallest such set, the bifurcation locus FORMULA ,
contains the image of the critical values of FORMULA , but may also contain
the images of critical points at infinity: since FORMULA  is not proper, one cannot
apply the Ehresmann fibration theorem. Generalizing work of Hà Huy Vui and
Lê DFORMULA  ung Tráng {{cite:123136a3-1986-4f22-a574-5526bb31ed84}}, Parusiński shows that a regular value FORMULA  for FORMULA  is not in FORMULA  if and only if the Euler characteristic of
FORMULA  is locally constant at FORMULA  {{cite:75446324-2caf-4623-911c-68876fe78065}}.
If FORMULA  is the polynomial of minimal degree defining FORMULA , we will say
that FORMULA  is non-bifurcated if 0 is not a bifurcation value for FORMULA 
(i.e. FORMULA , meaning FORMULA  is a trivial fibration in a neighborhood
of FORMULA ). More information on the behavior of
polynomials can be found in {{cite:fe15c3f9-98c3-4300-bc73-265d8d832889}} and {{cite:79bfddf8-507b-413f-8d9e-8c06ec6fcfff}}.
Theorem 1.1 
Fix FORMULA  and let FORMULA  be a smooth connected
non-bifurcated hypersurface.
If FORMULA  is a local diffeomorphism of simply connected manifolds
which is a FORMULA -fold covering map away from FORMULA , then FORMULA  or FORMULA .

For FORMULA  as in REF , we highlight two algebro-geometric cases:
Corollary 1.2  Let FORMULA  be a smooth connected non-bifurcated hypersurface.
If FORMULA  is an étale morphism with FORMULA  simply
connected and FORMULA  for FORMULA , then FORMULA  is birational.

Corollary 1.3  Let FORMULA  be a smooth connected non-bifurcated hypersurface.
If FORMULA  is a polynomial map with nonvanishing
jacobian and FORMULA  for FORMULA , then
FORMULA .

The conclusion of REF  also holds if FORMULA  has at worst simple normal
crossings away from a set of codimension FORMULA  and meets the
hyperplane at infinity transversely {{cite:e8e23c57-0dbf-4248-bf8d-6ee97405bd54}}.
It would be interesting to try to weaken the hypothesis of Theorem REF , for example
what happens if FORMULA  merely smooth and connected? Or if FORMULA  is a non-bifurcation hypersurface but reducible?
To state our main tool for obtaining these results, we need a definition.
An FORMULA -submanifold
FORMULA  nicely bounds a closed subset
FORMULA  if

FORMULA .

Each connected component of FORMULA  contains exactly
one connected component of FORMULA .

FORMULA  is the closure of an FORMULA -submanifold FORMULA 
with singular locus FORMULA  of codimension FORMULA  in
FORMULA  and FORMULA  is locally diffeomorphic to a half space
along FORMULA .

Remark 1.4 (a) For typical hypersurfaces FORMULA , the existence of a nicely
bounding manifold FORMULA  is natural. Suppose that FORMULA  is defined by the equation
FORMULA  and FORMULA  is a finite set for which
the restriction FORMULA  is a locally trivial fibration with fibre FORMULA  as in Verdier's theorem {{cite:cb0606cb-178a-433e-9d0c-1e8cdcc53a63}}.
If FORMULA  is smooth and connected, then in choosing an open ray FORMULA 
emanating from 0 which misses FORMULA , the contractibility of FORMULA  implies that
FORMULA  is an oriented manifold and it is clear that FORMULA 
nicely bounds FORMULA .
If FORMULA  is a non-bifurcation hypersurface, then FORMULA  and
FORMULA , hence we obtain an
isomorphism FORMULA .
(b) If FORMULA  is a FORMULA -fold cover away from FORMULA 
(with equation FORMULA ), we can arrange the situation in (a) by enlarging FORMULA 
as follows. Replace FORMULA  with FORMULA , where FORMULA  is general and
FORMULA  is prime. Then the hypothesis on FORMULA  is preserved,
FORMULA  is connected and FORMULA  cannot be be written FORMULA 
for FORMULA  of degree FORMULA , which implies that the general
fibre FORMULA  is smooth and connected by a Bertini theorem
{{cite:00bb6c15-8d24-4694-84cd-00d6337c0f4e}}. Of course this divisor FORMULA  may be bifurcated.

The degree of such maps often satisfies a certain trichotomy (Thm. REF ):
Theorem 1.5 
Let FORMULA  be a local diffeomorphism of connected
manifolds with FORMULA  and let FORMULA  be a
closed set for which the restriction FORMULA  is a
FORMULA -sheeted covering map.
If FORMULA  is nicely bounded by a connected FORMULA submanifold
FORMULA  with FORMULA  simply connected,
then FORMULA  or FORMULA .

The conclusion can be false if FORMULA  fails to be a local diffeomorphism at
even a single point (visualize the FORMULA th power map on FORMULA 
for FORMULA ).
Remark 1.6 
If the nicely bounding manifold FORMULA  is oriented, but possibly disconnected,
then FORMULA  or FORMULA  (Theorem REF ).

Remark 1.7 Theorem REF  is sharp as follows.
(a) All three values of FORMULA  occur. The identity map realizes FORMULA 
(for example take FORMULA  and
FORMULA ).
The value FORMULA  is realized by a map FORMULA  with
FORMULA  an embedded Klein bottle which is nicely bounded by
FORMULA , where FORMULA  is a Moebius band (see Example REF ).
The value FORMULA  is achieved by the complex exponential map
FORMULA  with FORMULA .
(b) The vanishing FORMULA  is necessary, for example
the FORMULA th power map FORMULA  is a FORMULA -sheet
covering map.

Corollary 1.8 
Let FORMULA  be a local diffeomorphism.
Assume that FORMULA  is connected, FORMULA  and the restriction
FORMULA 
is a FORMULA -sheeted cover for a finite subset FORMULA .
Then FORMULA  or FORMULA .

Corollary REF  follows from Remark REF  by taking FORMULA  to be the
union of disjoint open rays emanating from points in FORMULA , when
FORMULA  is contractible.
For hypersurfaces FORMULA  with FORMULA  it is unlikely that the
submanifold FORMULA  produced in Remark REF  will satisfy
FORMULA , hence Theorem REF  does not apply.
In typical situations surgery theory {{cite:7634225f-9704-4174-9e78-4669edcc5b83}} can be used to kill homotopy
classes of maps and we can modify FORMULA  to arrive at a suitable manifold FORMULA .
For this we need more conditions on the nicely bounding manifold FORMULA .

FORMULA  has finitely many connected components FORMULA  contained in
corresponding components FORMULA .

If FORMULA  is the singular locus, then
FORMULA  is onto.

Each component FORMULA  is orientable with FORMULA  finitely generated.

Theorem 1.9 
Suppose that FORMULA  is nicely bounded by a submanifold FORMULA 
satisfying the conditions 1-3 above and FORMULA .
Then there is another such FORMULA  nicely bounding FORMULA 
such that FORMULA .

Now Theorem REF  follows easily.
For FORMULA  and FORMULA , we produce an orientable
submanifold FORMULA  nicely bounding FORMULA  as in
Remark REF .
The hypersurface FORMULA  has finitely generated fundamental group
because it is a finite CW complex {{cite:fe15c3f9-98c3-4300-bc73-265d8d832889}}.
Since there is only one connected component and FORMULA  is empty,
Remark REF (a) gives conditions 1-3 above.
Theorem REF  allows us to replace nicely bounding FORMULA 
with FORMULA  satisfying FORMULA , at which point
Remark REF  gives the result.
If FORMULA , we consider
FORMULA  and
replace FORMULA  with FORMULA .
We expect the surgery technique to work even if the hypersurface FORMULA  is bifurcated, provided that the singularities are sufficiently mild.
These problems fit in with our general program of trying to understand
local versus global injectivity {{cite:c65490f2-84a3-4a3c-ad06-49863e901b8d}}, {{cite:eb481b65-cf72-4a15-b933-c262d42e7a9c}}, {{cite:e8e23c57-0dbf-4248-bf8d-6ee97405bd54}}, {{cite:fa6b4e9e-4a19-4adb-ae52-4740d6fd897d}}.
Indeed, for such maps with finite fibres, we are really asking when
a local immersion is injective.
As to the structure of the paper, Theorem REF  is proven in
FORMULA   and Theorem REF  is proven in FORMULA  .
We thank Francis Connolly for useful conversations.

A Counting Argument
In this section we prove Theorem REF  from the introduction.
The dichotomy in the cases FORMULA  and FORMULA  depends on the nature
of the pre-image FORMULA . We will show that if no component of FORMULA  is closed, then FORMULA , while if at least one component is closed, then FORMULA .
Proposition 2.1 
Let FORMULA  be a local diffeomorphism of connected manifolds which is a FORMULA -sheet cover away from a closed set FORMULA . Further assume that there is a FORMULA -submanifold FORMULA  such that

FORMULA  is nicely bounded by FORMULA .

FORMULA  is simply connected.

No connected component of FORMULA  is closed in FORMULA .

Then FORMULA .

It will suffice to show that FORMULA  is path-connected,
for then FORMULA  is a
FORMULA -sheeted covering map with FORMULA  simply connected, whence FORMULA  {{cite:af5d6b4d-e40c-4676-b8ca-94828d1b18bd}}.
In particular, FORMULA  is injective and identifies FORMULA  with a dense open subset of FORMULA .
To see that FORMULA  is path-connected, consider
FORMULA  and consider
a path FORMULA  from FORMULA  to FORMULA .
Deforming FORMULA , we may assume that

FORMULA  avoids FORMULA .

FORMULA  meets FORMULA  transversely a finite number of times.

Suppose that FORMULA  meets a connected component FORMULA  of FORMULA , say
FORMULA .
Since FORMULA  is not closed by hypothesis, there is a point
FORMULA  which necessarily satisfies FORMULA .
Taking an open neighborhood FORMULA  about FORMULA  which maps diffeomorphically onto the neighborhood FORMULA  about
FORMULA , we have a diffeomorphism of pairs
FORMULA  and since
FORMULA  has positive codimension, we can
choose FORMULA  so that FORMULA  avoids FORMULA  and
FORMULA  looks locally like a half-space at FORMULA .
With this in mind, consider a path FORMULA  from FORMULA  to
the point FORMULA .
Cover the image of FORMULA  with small open balls to obtain a tubular open neighborhood FORMULA  of FORMULA .
A ball about FORMULA  is not disconnected by FORMULA  and it
follows that FORMULA  itself is connected.
We may thus replace a segment of the path FORMULA  through
FORMULA  with a path contained in FORMULA .
Continuing this way with each intersection, we obtain a new path from
FORMULA  to FORMULA  which avoids FORMULA , hence the conclusion.
Remark 2.2 That FORMULA  be a local diffeomorphism at each point is critical in the result above.
For example, the squaring map FORMULA  by FORMULA  is a local
diffeomorphism everywhere except at FORMULA .
Taking FORMULA  and FORMULA  to be the positive real axis, the other hypotheses of
Proposition REF  hold, but FORMULA  and the conclusion fails.
The proof given above breaks down because FORMULA  is obtained from removing
the origin from the real axis, when it is clear that FORMULA  is
not connected: we can't connect the upper half plane and lower half plane by
going around the corner at FORMULA  precisely because FORMULA  is not a local diffeomorphism
there.


Now we deal with the case where some of the connected components of
FORMULA  are closed. We begin with the following separation lemma.
The example FORMULA  shows the necessity of the vanishing FORMULA .
Lemma 2.3 
Let FORMULA  be a connected FORMULA -manifold satisfying FORMULA .
If FORMULA  are FORMULA  disjoint closed connected
FORMULA -submanifolds
of FORMULA , then
FORMULA  has FORMULA  connected components FORMULA .

This is result is probably well-known to experts (the case FORMULA  can be
found in {{cite:9e6429f5-a868-4042-9e2b-82d6cfb7088b}}), but we include a proof for lack of suitable reference.
The vanishing FORMULA  implies that FORMULA  is orientable
{{cite:9e6429f5-a868-4042-9e2b-82d6cfb7088b}}.
Let FORMULA .
If FORMULA 
denotes the Alexander cohomology module with compact supports
and coefficients in FORMULA  {{cite:af5d6b4d-e40c-4676-b8ca-94828d1b18bd}},
the corresponding long exact cohomology sequence contains the fragment
FORMULA 
The last group vanishes due to dimension and
the Alexander duality theorem {{cite:af5d6b4d-e40c-4676-b8ca-94828d1b18bd}}
yields
FORMULA ,
FORMULA ,
FORMULA .
It follows that
FORMULA ,
hence FORMULA  has FORMULA  connected components.
Proposition 2.4 
Let FORMULA  be a local diffeomorphism of connected manifolds
which is a FORMULA -sheet cover away from a closed set FORMULA  and assume that
FORMULA .
Assume that there is an oriented FORMULA -submanifold
FORMULA  such that

FORMULA  is nicely bounded by FORMULA .

FORMULA  has a connected component which is closed in FORMULA .

Then FORMULA .

We assume that FORMULA  and draw a contradiction from the counting argument
that gives this section its name.
Let FORMULA  be a connected component of FORMULA  which is closed in FORMULA .
Then FORMULA  is contained in some connected component FORMULA  of FORMULA  and the
covering property shows that FORMULA .
The closed sub-manifold FORMULA  separates FORMULA  into two connected components
FORMULA  and FORMULA  by Lemma REF . Clearly the induced maps
FORMULA 
have the covering property with sheet numbers adding to FORMULA ,
but FORMULA  may be disconnected if
FORMULA  has closed components other than FORMULA .
Choose FORMULA  and write FORMULA  with
FORMULA  for some FORMULA .
If FORMULA  is a sufficiently small ball centered at FORMULA , then by the covering
property we may write
FORMULA 
disjointly with each FORMULA  mapping homeomorphically onto FORMULA  and
FORMULA .
Thus FORMULA  meet FORMULA  and each FORMULA  avoids FORMULA ,
hence is contained in either FORMULA  or FORMULA .
We may relabel the indices so that FORMULA  are contained in
FORMULA  and FORMULA  are contained in FORMULA .
Shrinking FORMULA  if necessary, we may further assume that
FORMULA  splits FORMULA  into two half balls FORMULA  and FORMULA  and that FORMULA 
does not meet FORMULA  otherwise (in particular it intersects no other components
of FORMULA ).
For FORMULA , each FORMULA  is separated by FORMULA  into two
connected pieces FORMULA  and FORMULA , with FORMULA  (resp. FORMULA )
mapping homeomorphically onto FORMULA  (resp. FORMULA ).
Since FORMULA  separates FORMULA , either FORMULA  or FORMULA . We suppose that
FORMULA  and FORMULA , but the proof is similar if it were the other
way around.
From the orientability of FORMULA , it follows that the pre-images of the half balls
are coherently arranged in the sense that FORMULA  (resp. FORMULA )
for all FORMULA .
To see this, consider a path FORMULA  from FORMULA  to FORMULA  for
FORMULA .
If FORMULA  is a vector field along FORMULA  which points into FORMULA ,
then the vector field FORMULA  along the loop FORMULA  points into
FORMULA  at time FORMULA . By invariance of local orientations under continuations
along a closed path, FORMULA  also points into FORMULA  at time FORMULA , which implies
that FORMULA . Similarly the FORMULA  are contained in FORMULA .
Now we arrive at a contradiction by counting pre-images.
A point in FORMULA  has FORMULA  pre-images in FORMULA :
FORMULA  of these come from the FORMULA  with FORMULA  and the remaining
FORMULA  come from FORMULA  for FORMULA .
Similarly a point in FORMULA  has FORMULA  pre-images in FORMULA , all coming from
FORMULA  with FORMULA .
In particular the cardinality of the fibres of
FORMULA  is not constant
(FORMULA ), a contradiction as this is a covering over a connected base.
Theorem 2.5 
Let FORMULA  be a connected manifold satisfying FORMULA  and let
FORMULA  be a local diffeomorphism which is a FORMULA -fold
cover away from a closed codimension two subset FORMULA .
Suppose that there is an oriented FORMULA -submanifold FORMULA  such that

FORMULA  is nicely bounded by FORMULA .

FORMULA  is simply connected.

Then FORMULA  or FORMULA .

This follows from Propositions REF  and REF , since either
FORMULA  has a closed connected component or it does not.
Remark 2.6 If FORMULA  is given by the vanishing of FORMULA  and the hypersurface
FORMULA  is simply connected for general FORMULA , then we can
construct a suitable submanifold FORMULA  as follows.
There is a finite point set FORMULA 
such that FORMULA  is a locally trivial fibration with
fibre FORMULA . Enlarge FORMULA  to assume that FORMULA .
Now choose disjoint open rays FORMULA  emanating from the FORMULA .
Set FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Then FORMULA  has FORMULA  connected components and is nicely bounded by FORMULA .
Furthermore, since FORMULA  is a
locally trivial fibration over a contractible base with simply connected fibre FORMULA ,
it follows that FORMULA  is simply connected.
Thus Theorem REF  applies and FORMULA  or FORMULA .


Our methods also work when FORMULA  is not orientable, but connected.
Theorem 2.7 
Let FORMULA  be a connected manifold satisfying FORMULA  and let
FORMULA  be a local diffeomorphism which is a FORMULA -fold cover away
from a closed subset FORMULA .
Suppose that there is a connected FORMULA -submanifold FORMULA  such that

FORMULA  is nicely bounded by FORMULA .

FORMULA  is simply connected.

Then FORMULA  or FORMULA .

If no connected component of FORMULA  is closed, then Proposition REF  still
applies and we obtain FORMULA . If there is a closed such component, we must
modify the proof of Proposition REF .
Here we consider all the closed connected components
FORMULA  of FORMULA .
By Lemma REF  these separate FORMULA  into FORMULA  connected components
FORMULA .
Now each FORMULA  has the covering
property.
Moreover, we may argue as in Prop. REF  that each FORMULA 
is connected: that FORMULA  is a local diffeomorphism allows us to “go around the edge" in the
same way.
Since the base is 1-connected, we conclude that these maps are homeomorphisms and FORMULA .
Letting FORMULA  be the covering degree of the restriction FORMULA , we have
FORMULA .
If FORMULA , this forces FORMULA  for some FORMULA  (since FORMULA  already), say FORMULA .
Then FORMULA  via FORMULA  and we run the proof of Proposition REF  with
FORMULA .
Things proceed as before, though now FORMULA .
We don't need to use the orientability of FORMULA  to check that the FORMULA  can be
coherently arranged for FORMULA , since there is only one.
Thus the counting contradiction runs as before, as the preimage of a point
in FORMULA  has FORMULA  pre-images in FORMULA  while a point in FORMULA  has FORMULA  such pre-images.
Hence FORMULA  gives a contradiction, leaving FORMULA  or FORMULA .
Remark 2.8 Comparing to Theorem REF , we see that when FORMULA  is not
orientable the new possibility FORMULA  arises.
We give an example in which this new possibility is realized.
Fix an unknotted circle FORMULA  and consider its normal
disk bundle, which is a solid torus. Inside the solid torus there is a Moebius
band FORMULA  which makes one half twist as it goes around.
The boundary FORMULA  of this Moebius band is a 2-1 torus
knot which is known to be the unknot.
We will show that FORMULA  nicely bounds a closed set FORMULA ,
which can be smoothed to obtain a Klein bottle FORMULA  for which FORMULA .
In particular, the composition FORMULA  of the universal
covering map with the inclusion has degree FORMULA .
To verify the claims above, let FORMULA  be the
4-dimensional half space.
For each integer FORMULA  we set FORMULA  and define the
manifold FORMULA  by
FORMULA 
Notice that
FORMULA 
is just FORMULA  minus a Moebius band.
It is a bit angular, but we will round off the corners later.
More importantly, the inclusion FORMULA  is a deformation retract and
hence a homotopy equivalence: thus FORMULA , as the limit of the FORMULA ,
is isomorphic to FORMULA  for any FORMULA .
We compute FORMULA  as follows.
Apply Van Kampen's theorem to
FORMULA 
The intersection of the two pieces is FORMULA  and the two inclusions
FORMULA  and
FORMULA 
are homotopy equivalences.
Since FORMULA  is unknotted, FORMULA  and
a generator is any small circle FORMULA  linking FORMULA .
Since FORMULA  is Abelian, base points are not important.
Recall FORMULA  is the middle circle in the Moebius and note
that the inclusion FORMULA  is a homotopy equivalence.
Since FORMULA  is unknotted, FORMULA . One choice
of generator is to pick a meridian circle to the solid torus containing FORMULA  and push
it out just a bit until it no longer intersects the solid torus, call this circle FORMULA .
Since FORMULA  is abelian, base points are not important here.
Finally compute the map FORMULA .
The obvious disk bounding the generator of FORMULA  intersects
FORMULA  in two points, both with the same sign, hence the map is multiplication
by FORMULA : FORMULA .
Thus FORMULA  with generator FORMULA .
To finish, we apply Van Kampen's theorem to
FORMULA 
The intersection is FORMULA .
Since FORMULA , it follows that
FORMULA  which
by the above calculation is FORMULA .
We conclude that FORMULA 
generated by a circle in FORMULA  linking FORMULA .
Having produced FORMULA  above, we mirror the constuction to obtain
FORMULA  whose complement is a Moebius band.
Gluing FORMULA  to FORMULA  along FORMULA  gives FORMULA  which contains
FORMULA : let FORMULA  be the embedding.
The boundary of FORMULA  is a non-orientable surface of Euler
characteristic 0, hence a Klein bottle.
Let FORMULA .
By construction FORMULA  and again Van Kampen's theorem gives
FORMULA .
This FORMULA  is certainly not smooth but by rounding corners we can make
it smooth.
A direct approach in this example is to find a FORMULA  function
FORMULA  which is FORMULA 
on a neighborhood of FORMULA  and 1 on a neighborhood of the core.
Let FORMULA  be defined by FORMULA 
Let FORMULA  be the image of
FORMULA .
The boundary of FORMULA  is still a Klein bottle and FORMULA  is a FORMULA 
submanifold of
FORMULA .
Then the composition
FORMULA  is FORMULA .
Hence FORMULA  is a smoothly embedded
Klein bottle, bounding a smoothly embedded 3-manifold with
FORMULA .



Construction of bounding manifolds
In this section we prove Theorem REF  from the introduction.
The main point is Lemma REF , which uses surgery to annihilate elements in the fundamental group of the bounding manifold. We will use the following general set up.
Hypotheses 3.1 
Let FORMULA  be an FORMULA -manifold with FORMULA -submanifold FORMULA  and closed subset FORMULA . The triple FORMULA  satisfies Hypothesis REF  if the following hold.

FORMULA  and FORMULA  are orientable.

FORMULA  has finitely many components and is nicely bounded by FORMULA . In particular FORMULA  is the closure of an FORMULA -submanifold FORMULA  with singular set FORMULA  of codimension FORMULA  in FORMULA .

Each component of FORMULA  has finitely generated fundamental group.

For each FORMULA , the map
FORMULA  is onto.


Remarks 3.2 Since FORMULA  is a manifold with boundary,
FORMULA  is a homotopy equivalence.
Since FORMULA  has codimension 2,
FORMULA  is onto and
FORMULA  is an isomorphism.
If FORMULA  is connected, so is FORMULA .

We will need the following definition.
Definition 3.3 If FORMULA  and FORMULA  are submanifolds of FORMULA , we say that FORMULA  and FORMULA  are equal at  FORMULA
provided there exists a compact set FORMULA  such that
FORMULA  and FORMULA  are equal as subsets of FORMULA .

Theorem 3.4 
If the triple FORMULA  satisfies REF  and FORMULA ,
then there exists a submanifold FORMULA  such that FORMULA 
also satisfies REF , FORMULA  is equal to FORMULA  at FORMULA  and
FORMULA 

We reduce the proof to the two lemmas which follow.
Remove the singular set FORMULA  to obtain the new triple
FORMULA ,
which clearly satisfies REF .
Lemma REF  allows us to replace FORMULA  with a new submanifold
FORMULA  which is equal to FORMULA  at infinity and such that
FORMULA  requires one fewer generators than FORMULA  (by which we mean the free product of FORMULA , where one
basepoint FORMULA  is chosen from each connected component FORMULA , as FORMULA 
may be disconnected).
Because FORMULA  and FORMULA  are equal at infinity, the new triple
FORMULA  satisfies REF  and
FORMULA .
Note the closures take place in different sets: the left-hand closure
is equal to the right-hand closure union FORMULA .
Repeated application reduces to the case that FORMULA  is trivial,
at which point Lemma REF  shows that
FORMULA .
Lemma 3.5 
Suppose that FORMULA  satisfies REF  with
FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Then FORMULA .

Let FORMULA  represent an
element of FORMULA . It suffices to show that
FORMULA  extends to a map of the disk FORMULA .
By hypothesis we can extend FORMULA  to a map FORMULA  and
we may assume that FORMULA  is an embedding since FORMULA .
The set FORMULA  is a manifold with boundary FORMULA , so
we may further assume that FORMULA  is transverse
to FORMULA .
Now FORMULA  is a closed, compact 1-manifold,
hence a disjoint union of circles and closed arcs in the interior of FORMULA .
The transverse condition also guarantees that FORMULA 
consists of circles
and open arcs and FORMULA  consists entirely of points which
are the end points of the arcs: no image of a circle is tangent to FORMULA .
Each circle in FORMULA  divides the disk into two components, an inside
(homeomorphic to a disk) and an outside (homeomorphic to an annulus).
Pick an outer-most circle FORMULA  from FORMULA , not contained
on the inside of any other circle of FORMULA .
The embedded circle FORMULA  in FORMULA  is null homotopic in FORMULA  by hypothesis.
Since FORMULA  and FORMULA 
consists of a finite number of open arcs and circles, this circle bounds an embedded disk FORMULA  such that FORMULA .
The normal bundle FORMULA  of FORMULA  in FORMULA  is a real line bundle which
restricted to FORMULA  is trivial.
The normal bundle to FORMULA  in FORMULA  is also trivial and picking the
direction into the outside
annulus gives a trivialization of FORMULA  restricted to FORMULA .
This trivialization extends across FORMULA  and it is now possible to
cut out a neighborhood
of the inside of FORMULA  and glue in a copy of FORMULA  pushed off of FORMULA  (in the direction of FORMULA ) so that the new embedded disk has fewer circles.
Since there are only finitely many circles, continuing this process
will result in a new embedding FORMULA  for which
FORMULA  consists entirely of arcs in
the interior of FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be the image of an arc, so the
interior of the arc is in FORMULA  and the two endpoints are in FORMULA .
Both endpoints are in the same component of FORMULA  and so by
REF (b), they are in
the same component of FORMULA , hence
they may be joined by an arc in FORMULA .
The resulting circle in FORMULA  is null homotopic because FORMULA  is a homotopy equivalence.
Since FORMULA  there is an embedded disk
FORMULA  so that
FORMULA  is an arc in
FORMULA  and
FORMULA  is the open interior of the arc FORMULA .
We can further assume that FORMULA ,
so that no part of FORMULA  goes near FORMULA  except for the arc under discussion.
Enlarge FORMULA  to a disk FORMULA  with FORMULA  in its interior so that FORMULA  is a single arc, which must extend the
arc FORMULA .
This arc divides FORMULA  into two pieces, one in FORMULA  and one in
FORMULA .
The normal bundle to FORMULA  in FORMULA  is trivial, so pick a trivialization.
By transversality this picks out a nonvanishing section of FORMULA  restricted to FORMULA , which extends to a section of FORMULA  restricted to
FORMULA .
Viewing this as a section of the normal bundle to
FORMULA  in FORMULA , we may extend it to obtain
a section FORMULA  of the normal bundle FORMULA  of FORMULA  in FORMULA 
which is normal to FORMULA  along the common intersection.
Now choose an isotopy of FORMULA  under which FORMULA  ends up in
the piece of FORMULA  in FORMULA . Extend this to an isotopy
of FORMULA , using the section FORMULA  of FORMULA  along FORMULA  to make the movement locally parallel to FORMULA .
When we apply this isotopy to FORMULA , we remove the arc FORMULA 
and create no further intersections, thus the new embedding of the disk
has the same boundary and intersects FORMULA  in no circles and
one fewer arc. Continue until there are no arcs (or circles).
Lemma 3.6 
Suppose that FORMULA  satisfies REF  with FORMULA  and FORMULA  is generated by FORMULA  elements.
Then there is a submanifold FORMULA  such that FORMULA 
satisfies
REF , FORMULA  and FORMULA  are equal at FORMULA  and
FORMULA  is generated by at most FORMULA  elements.

Let FORMULA  be generators.
Since FORMULA , the element
FORMULA  can be represented by an embedded circle FORMULA  on some component of FORMULA .
The normal bundle FORMULA  to FORMULA  in FORMULA  is a trivial line bundle.
Use this trivialization to embed an annulus in FORMULA  intersecting
FORMULA  precisely in FORMULA .
The embedded circle FORMULA  at the other end of the annulus is null homotopic in FORMULA  and extends to an embedded disk
FORMULA  because FORMULA  has dimension FORMULA .
Clearly FORMULA  contains FORMULA  by construction, but it may contain more.
We may assume that FORMULA  meets FORMULA  transversely away from FORMULA , hence FORMULA  consists of FORMULA  along
with a finite number of circles and arcs in the interior of FORMULA .
This time we deal with the arcs first.
Let FORMULA  be an arc in FORMULA .
It lies in a component of FORMULA , so both endpoints
are in a component of FORMULA  and can
be connected by an arc FORMULA  in FORMULA .
Choosing one endpoint FORMULA  as basepoint, condition REF (d)
gives a loop FORMULA  based at FORMULA  in FORMULA  such that FORMULA  in FORMULA . Replacing FORMULA  with
FORMULA  gives an arc in FORMULA  for which the embedded circle FORMULA  is null homotopic in FORMULA .
We may further assume that FORMULA  intersects the finite set
FORMULA  only in the two endpoints of
FORMULA .
Consider the open annulus FORMULA :
FORMULA  is an open 2-disk and removing the
arc FORMULA  is the topologically the same as removing a point.
Then FORMULA  is a finite union of circles and closed
arcs so FORMULA  is null homotopic in
FORMULA 
(we have removed all the circles and arcs except FORMULA  and FORMULA ).
Since the dimension of FORMULA  is FORMULA , FORMULA  bounds an
embedded disk FORMULA  such that
FORMULA .
Just as in the last part of the proof of Lemma REF ,
we extend FORMULA  to a larger embedded disk FORMULA 
such that FORMULA  is an arc containing FORMULA .
There is a neighborhood FORMULA  of FORMULA 
such that FORMULA  is the original annulus.
The usual Whitney trick isotopy {{cite:7634225f-9704-4174-9e78-4669edcc5b83}} produces
a new embedded disk FORMULA  so that
FORMULA .
Repeating this process for each arc, we may assume that our disk
FORMULA  intersects FORMULA  in a finite number of circles:
all arcs are gone.
So far we have not altered FORMULA , but to get rid of the circles we will.
Begin by locating an inner-most circle FORMULA , one whose interior
contains no other circles.
Then FORMULA  bounds an embedded disk FORMULA 
such that FORMULA .
We perform an operation known as adding a 2-handle
{{cite:7634225f-9704-4174-9e78-4669edcc5b83}}.
Specifically, let FORMULA  be the normal bundle to FORMULA  in FORMULA .
By tranversality this is also the restriction of FORMULA , the
normal bundle to FORMULA  in FORMULA .
Since FORMULA  is a bundle on a disk, it is trivial so fix a trivialization.
This trivializes FORMULA .
Form the union FORMULA  where
FORMULA  is the closed disk bundle associated to
FORMULA .
If FORMULA  is a basepoint in
FORMULA ,
Van Kampen's theorem produces a pushout diagram
FORMULA 
from which we see that FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the normal closure of FORMULA .
Now form FORMULA  from FORMULA  by removing the open disk bundle.
The result is not a differentiable manifold as there are corners where FORMULA  meets FORMULA , but let us note several properties of FORMULA .
Since FORMULA  by construction, the new intersection has one less circle.
Since the construction takes place within a compact set,
FORMULA  and FORMULA  are equal at FORMULA  and it is clear that
FORMULA  satisfies REF  because FORMULA  near FORMULA .
Now FORMULA  is an isomorphism (by Van Kampen's theorem, for example) and we write
FORMULA  so that FORMULA  is still generated by FORMULA .
The commutative diagram
FORMULA 
shows that the top map is onto. Indeed, the left vertical map is onto by hypothesis, the bottom map is onto because FORMULA  is
(the inclusions FORMULA  and FORMULA  are homotopy equivalences) and the right vertical map is an isomorphism because FORMULA  is.
Finally we round the corners of FORMULA  to obtain a differentiable manifold.
This process is a homeomorphism (though not a diffeomorphism) so we retain all the properties of FORMULA  above. By the same process we remove an inner-most circle of FORMULA  to get FORMULA  and
so on until we find a FORMULA  such that FORMULA ,
FORMULA  satisfy REF  and FORMULA  at infinity.
Now we can trade the 2-handle FORMULA  to get FORMULA  where FORMULA  and FORMULA 
are equal at FORMULA , FORMULA  satisfy REF  and
FORMULA  maps onto FORMULA  with FORMULA  definitely in the kernel,
hence FORMULA  is generated by FORMULA , ..., FORMULA .
