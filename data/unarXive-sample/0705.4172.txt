We analyze a large collection of RXTE archive data from April 1997
to August 2003 of the bright X-ray source Scorpius X-1 in order to
study the broadband spectral evolution of the source for different
values of the inferred mass accretion rate by studying energy
spectra from selected regions in the Z-track of its Color-Color
Diagram. A two-component model, consisting of a soft thermal
component interpreted as thermal emission from an accretion disk and
a thermal Comptonization component, is unable to fit the whole
3–200 keV energy spectrum at low accretion rates. Strong residuals
in the highest energy band of the spectrum require the addition of a
third component that can be fitted with a power-law component, that
could represent a second thermal Comptonization from a much hotter
plasma, or a hybrid thermal/non-thermal Comptonization, where the
electrons in the Comptonizing cloud have a Maxwellian distribution
of velocities with a power-law hard tail. The presence of this hard
emission in Scorpius X-1  has been previously reported, however, without a
clear relation with the accretion rate. We show, for the first
time, that there exists a common trend in the spectral evolution of
the source, where the spectral parameters change in correlation with
the position of the source in the CD. In particular, using a hybrid
thermal/non-thermal Comptonization model (EQPAIR code), we show that
the power supplied to the non-thermal distribution can be as high as
half of the total hard power injected in heating the electron
distribution. We also found that a small sample of spectra, when
the source resides at the top of the FB can also show intense hard
X-ray emission. We discuss the physical implications derived from
the results of our analysis, with a particular emphasis on the
hardest part of the X-ray emission and its possible origins.

Introduction
Scorpius X-1
Scorpius X-1  is the brightest persistent X-ray source in the sky and the
first identified X-ray extra-solar source {{cite:f2965588-aa82-4d94-85f0-2cbaa434ad74}}. The
X-ray source is an old, low magnetized neutron star (NS), accreting
matter transferred through Roche-lobe overflow from a low-mass
companion {{cite:8b492531-d6a5-4c77-bb45-c19331e43f8e}}. Scorpius X-1  is a prototype of the class of the
Low-Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs), and assuming a distance of FORMULA  kpc {{cite:25201e27-564e-4856-be1d-6f4fc31fd975}}, the source emits close to the theoretical
Eddington limit for a 1.4 FORMULA   NS (FORMULA 
erg sFORMULA ).
Based on the timing behavior of LMXBs in correlation with the position
of a given source in the X-ray color-color diagram (CD),
{{cite:afb58ebe-bb08-4624-b378-62f87fba2d1f}} grouped these sources into two categories: the Z
sources and the Atoll sources. The former are brighter, radiating
close to FORMULA , the latter are less bright, emitting at 0.01–0.1
FORMULA . Z sources exhibit the classical three-shaped branches
describing a Z pattern in the CD: the Horizontal Branch (HB) at the
top of the Z track, followed by the Normal Branch (NB) and the Flaring
Branch (FB) at the bottom of the pattern. There are strong
indications {{cite:86fc6971-2133-46a5-8e69-ff526712413e}} suggesting that what drives the
changing in the spectral and temporal properties of LMXBs is the
instantaneous accretion rate (FORMULA ), which, for Z sources, is
believed to increase monotonically from the HB to the FB. Similarly,
Atoll sources, display two different spectral/timing states: the soft
and luminous banana state, associated to higher accretion rates, and
the hard and less luminous island state, associated to lower FORMULA .
This early and straightforward classification has now moved to a more
complex picture, as the patterns that Atoll and Z sources describe in
their CDs, when displayed on long timescales, appear to be more and
more similar to each other {{cite:2c541bfb-6f9f-4e4b-b155-4c0da55291d3}}, {{cite:e710c658-82a4-4562-a7af-f4f173141d63}}, although some
observational facts still hold: Z sources move on the CDs on
shorter timescales, have higher luminosities and present a timing
phenomenology different from that of the Atoll sources.
Scorpius X-1, as all the sources of its class, shows several quasi-periodic
oscillations (QPOs) along all the branches of its CD: the horizontal
branch oscillations (HBOs), the normal branch oscillations (NBOs) and
the flaring branch oscillations (FBOs). In Scorpius X-1  NBOs, with peak
frequencies in the range 4.5–7 Hz, and FBOs, in the frequency range
6–25 Hz, seem to be physically related to each other since the NBO
peak frequency smoothly joins the FBO peak frequency as the source
moves from the NB to the FB {{cite:55aebf73-d395-4240-bcc3-4d0c0965812c}}. Van der Klis et al.
(1996) reported the first observation of HBOs in Scorpius X-1  at 45 Hz, with
an inferred harmonic near 90 Hz; the power spectrum can also show a
pair of QPOs, whose frequencies are in the range 800-1100 Hz, denoted
kHzQPOs, that shift simultaneously in frequency, with an almost
constant or weakly frequency-dependent peak separation {{cite:dbef3660-9081-49ca-b2a5-6cc635332582}}. The physical interpretation of these timing
features is not unique and the related scientific debate is still open
{{cite:51c6c9c7-35d5-4a13-8a56-459f0af81295}}.
Spectral studies of Scorpius X-1  have been so far not so extensive and
detailed as timing studies. This is in part due to the strong
brightness of the source that actually prevents its observation with
the most sophisticated and high-resolution X-ray satellites like
BeppoSAX and ASCA in the recent past and Chandra and XMM-Newton at
present. Three articles have investigated so far the broad-band
spectral behavior of the source, using data from the Rossi X-ray
Timing Explorer (RXTE). {{cite:7980ccd6-bc8b-46c8-ab18-b53f48ce1e4c}} used data from both the
Proportional Counter Array (PCA) and the High Energy X-ray Timing
Experiment (HEXTE), showing that the spectrum, in the energy range
2.5–50 keV, can be fitted by a simple two-component model, a
black-body soft component and a cutoff power-law, plus a broad
Gaussian line, and interpreted these results in the framework of the
so called Birmingham model {{cite:a5685936-976a-498c-8ae1-d5ea4ca386b3}}. In this interpretation
the spectral emission consists of black-body emission from the NS plus
Comptonized emission from an extended accretion disk corona.
{{cite:c4cf7501-f37d-4f4d-bd10-3ca3e8c8ceee}} used only PCA data (in the 2.5–18.2 keV range),
adopting a model consisting of a black body emission plus a bulk
motion Comptonization component and a reflection component in the form
of a broad Gaussian line. {{cite:2cca9d85-750b-4b61-af7d-49480e30b800}} studied HEXTE data above
20 keV, in order to test the presence of high energy X-ray emission in
the spectra of the source. Data were fitted, using a bremsstrahlung
component, to mimic the effects of the thermal component, and a
power-law component, whenever the statistics and clear residuals in
the fit required it. In this way no apparent correlation was found
between the presence of the hard tail and position of the source in
the CD, contrarily to what had been reported for other Z sources.
More recently, {{cite:2abb1588-548d-47f4-b2b1-4eb52dc279b9}}, using INTEGRAL data in the 20–200
keV energy band, detected a hard X-ray tail, with photon index values
between 2 and 3.4, whose intensity decreased as the source moved
towards higher accretion rates. Data did not show evidence of a
high-energy cutoff up to FORMULA  200 keV, suggesting a non-thermal
origin for the hard tail.
Scorpius X-1  is also an interesting source of radio emission.
{{cite:85dab153-2047-49b4-930a-c62dec1e3b34}}, through an extensive VLBA monitoring campaign,
have shown that the radio emission is composed of a point-like radio
core emission at the position of the X-ray source and of two opposite
radio lobes, moving through the ISM with relativistic speeds FORMULA , and with an angle of 46FORMULA 6FORMULA  with
respect to our line of sight. It is also evident a connection between
the phenomenon of radio flare at the core of the source and the
following flaring of the lobes, so that it is argued that the energy
production of the radio emission is confined near the NS and only
afterward transported to the lobes via the working surface of a jet
{{cite:96d0486a-fcb0-4c32-b581-a7b7a70ab90c}}.
These results stimulated the search for the possible connection
between inflow and outflow mechanisms working in the violent regimes
of accretion onto a NS or a black hole (BH). Energetic mass outflows,
collimated sometimes in a typical jet pattern, can be produced not
only in extragalactic X-ray sources, such as quasars and active
galactic nuclei (AGN), but also in galactic X-ray binary systems
{{cite:94eec693-01fb-43c8-a208-7b2de2d6c8c1}}. It has been observed that
galactic BH binary systems are able to produce strong jet emission
(sources for which a jet has been already spatially resolved are
usually denoted microquasars), with radio-loud states
associated to hard/low X-ray states, alternated to periods of
radio-quenching during soft/high X-ray states. For NS systems
radio-loud episodes are generally interpreted as a jet signature. In
this context, all the Z sources seem to owe, under certain conditions,
a radio-jet nature. Detections of radio-loud states are usually
associated with spectral states of low FORMULA , i.e. on the HB of the
Z-track {{cite:2bfa8f04-a003-4229-afd1-f77197efc46b}}, while the few radio detections in atoll
systems found the sources residing in the island state of their CDs
{{cite:8123736b-cfb9-4183-9407-d39aa0ebd25c}}.

Spectral properties of Z sources class
We rapidly review in this section the spectral properties of the Z
sources. The class of the Z sources display a homogeneous pattern of
spectral properties; their energy spectra can be usually decomposed as
follows:

a soft thermal component, with characteristic temperatures in
the 0.5–1 keV range, interpreted as thermal emission from the NS
surface or an optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disk;

a thermal Comptonized component, where the electron cloud
distribution has a temperature in the 2.5–3 keV range, the soft
seed photon temperature is around 1 keV and the optical depth can
have rather large values (FORMULA  3); this relatively cold
thermal Comptonization is thought to take place close to the NS
surface; the soft seed photon temperature generally exceeds the
highest temperature reached in the accretion disk, so that the
source of the soft emission is probably confined in the boundary
layer between the inner edge of the accretion disk and the NS
surface. The high optical depth values associated to the cloud
saturates the seed photon spectrum close to the electron
temperature, so that a quasi Wien spectrum results. A theoretical
interpretation of this spectral decomposition has been given by
{{cite:86218613-d8dd-4e71-b0fb-9be6f3eb4a79}}, where the boundary layer emission is expected to
be radiation pressure supported and its emission is locally at the
Eddington rate. Change in luminosity is attributed to a change in
the emitting area rather than in its emissivity. Phase resolved
spectroscopy of bright LMXBs {{cite:f63a7831-3e6b-4168-b9e8-0672a75f603f}} further supports
this interpretation, establishing in all the analyzed Z sources a
common cut-off, due to the boundary layer thermal emission, at
FORMULA  2.4 keV.

a reflection component, often simply modelled with a broad
Gaussian line, in the 6.4-6.9 keV range. In all the Z sources this
line has been always observed; spectra from BeppoSAX or RXTE
observations were not able to constraint the shape of the line,
while the relative width was in the range 0.1-1 keV. High
resolution spectra in this energy range have been obtained so far
only with the BBRXT {{cite:e633b1a5-6bdb-43a6-8944-fbdbef9c7ac9}} and the XMM-Newton satellites
{{cite:3b28abe0-bdba-4194-b15f-953b572b2d75}} for Cygnus X-2; in both observations the line
was associated to highly ionized iron (centroid energy FORMULA  6.7
keV), while the line appears to be intrinsically broad (FWHM FORMULA 
1 keV). {{cite:00d5bf50-436b-4507-ad3b-06be010b82a1}} pointed out that the determination of the
line profile can be a primary diagnostic tool, but, at the same
time, kinematic and relativistic effects can greatly distort the
line from the simple Gaussian profile. Moreover, if reflection is
caused by hard X-rays reflected by a cold accretion disk, the
contribution of the Compton reflected continuum should be taken into
account, when the iron line emission is a considerable contribution
to the total energy flux;

a power-law hard tail, which can contribute up to few percent to
the total energy flux, whose strenght usually varies in correlation
with the position of the source in the CD, namely being the
strongest on the HB, gradually decreasing as the source moves to
higher accretion rates and totally fading in the FB {{cite:244369d7-e9a4-449b-9af8-4aa9c6ca86cc}}. The photon index of the power-law was
generally found in the range 1.5–3 with no evident high energy
cutoff up to energies of about 200 keV.

In this article we report a complete investigation of the spectral
properties of Scorpius X-1  through an extensive analysis of RXTE archive
data, indicating a clear connection between position of the source on
the CD and spectral behavior.

Data reduction and analysis
The scientific payload of RXTE consists of three instruments, the PCA,
the HEXTE, and the All Sky Monitor (ASM). The PCA consists of five
co-aligned Xenon proportional counter units (PCUs) with a total
effective area of about 6500 cmFORMULA . The instrument is sensitive in
the energy range from 2 keV up to 60 keV {{cite:82d3122e-8216-4052-8e6c-2591d460a974}}, although the
response matrix is best calibrated in the energy range 3-22 keV. Data
can be processed using several different configuration modes; for our
analysis we exclusively use the Standard2 mode, with 16 s
time resolution and 128 energy channels in the 2–60 keV energy range.
The HEXTE consists of two cluster of four NaI/CsI-phoswich
scintillation counters that are sensitive from 15 keV up to 220 keV
{{cite:b16e1f79-69c6-4a50-a4e3-51758b007217}}. We use the Standard Mode, with 64 energy
channels, for the reduction and analysis of the HEXTE data. Background
subtraction is done by using the source-background rocking of the
collimators. We use HEXTE response matrices of 1999 August.
We collected a large amount of RXTE archive data, discarding only
minor shorter observations, from April 1997 up to August 2003. We
present in Table  the datasets we used for our analysis,
indicating the associated proposal number, the starting and ending
times of each observation in Terrestrial Time, and the corresponding
exposure times.
Data have been processed using the standard selection criteria,
discarding data taken during Earth occultations and passages through
the South Atlantic Anomaly. We only used data from PCU2 for the PCA
and data from Cluster A for the HEXTE instrument. We constructed
color-color diagrams (CDs) of the source by extracting
energy-dependent lightcurves using PCA energy channels 5–10,
11–16,17–22 and 23–44, with a 64 s bintime. These channel ranges
correspond to the energy ranges 1.94–4.05 keV, 4.05–6.18 keV,
6.18–8.32 keV, 8.32–16.26 keV respectively. We define the Soft
Color (hereafter SC) as the ratio of count rates in the 4.05–6.18 keV
and 1.94–4.05 energy bands, while the Hard Color (hereafter HC) as
the ratio of count rates in the 8.32–16.26 keV and 6.18–8.32 keV
energy ranges. However, the channel to energy conversion depend on
the period of activity of the satellite (there are 5 different
instrumental Epochs), most of our data belong to Epoch 3 for which the
given energy bands are appropriate; for the Epoch 5 datasets the
energy ranges are slightly shifted, so that this results in a
consequent shift on the HC and on the SC axes. Because we are not
interested in the secular shifts of the track in the CD, nor we want
to accumulate spectra taken at different Epochs, but to perform a
statistical study of the broad-band spectral behavior of the source
for different CD positions in different datasets, we did not perform
the energy dependent corrections to the colors.
We selected regions in the CDs for each observation dataset, in order
to cover a homogeneous part of the Z-track and to have at the same
time a suitable statistics. From these selections we derived the good
time intervals (GTI) which we used for extracting the corresponding
spectra for the PCA and HEXTE data.
Given the high luminosity of the source all the PCA spectra have been
dead-time corrected. Some observations were performed with the use of
an offset pointing; in these cases we extracted the responses matrixes
of both the HEXTE and the PCA instruments, following the indications
given in the on-line Data Analysis documentation pages. We processed
and analyzed data using version 6.0 of the FTOOLS package suite and
version 11.3.1 of Xspec.

Observation log of the RXTE datasets used for our analysis. Some
datasets, although having the same proposal number contain pointed
observation separated by long time intervals. In these cases we
collected all the pointing observations close in time in just one
CD, and distinguish the relative CDs by a letter, following the
proposal number. Starting and ending times are expressed in
Terrestrial Time. Effective exposures times are filtered by our GTI
screening criteria.

 Hereafter we shall refer to a collection of close in time pointed
observations used to extract one CD by using its proposal number.
From datasets 20035 (and 30035) we have obtained two different CDs; we
will label them, respectively, 20035A and 20035B (30035A and 30035B,
see the Spectrum column in Table ). Datasets
20035A, 20035B, 30036, 30035A, 30035B and 40020 belong to Epoch 3,
while datasets 70014, 70015 and 80021 belong to Epoch 5. Datasets
70014 and 70015 have been merged in one CD, because these observations
were close in time and the source pointing was the same.
The eight CDs that we have extracted present the source mostly on the
NB/FB, as these are the states where the source spends most of the
time. In Scorpius X-1  the HB is not horizontal but rather a
vertical continuation of the NB (a characteristic shared also by GX
17+2 and GX 349+2, the so-called Sco-like sources). For visual
clarity we will refer to the Scorpius X-1  CD pattern, mainly making the
distinction between the left (or FB) track and the right (NB and HB)
track, and between the top (harder) parts and the bottom (softer)
parts of the tracks.
The count rates associated with the extracted spectra show a
significant trend, generally correlated with the HC; HEXTE and PCA
count rates are the highest at the top of the FB and monotonically
decrease towards the FB/NB apex; following the direction bottom NB
FORMULA  HB, the trend is inverted. This behavior is mostly
stressed in the HEXTE data (compare the countrate in spectrum 07 in
the top FB with spectrum 10 in the transition region FB/NB, for which
the rate is reduced by two thirds in the HEXTE, but only by one third
in the PCA).
FIGURE 
In four datasets (20035A, 20035B, 40020 and 30036) the satellite
pointed the source on axis; in three datasets (30035A, 30035B, 80021)
an offset pointing has been used. This influenced the high energy
statistics, where in the same position on the CD, an offset pointing
produced an HEXTE count rate lowered by almost one order of magnitude.
Spectra extracted from datasets 70014 and 70015 have also low
statistics in the HEXTE band, as the integration time is shorter
compared with the other spectra.
We generally used a 3.0–22 keV energy band for the PCA spectra and a
20–200 keV energy band for the HEXTE spectra. HEXTE channels from 28
to 63 have been rebinned, grouping four channels into one. In some of
the spectra that we extracted we found, however, model-independent
mismatches in the overlapping energy region between the HEXTE and the
PCA; because these mismatches are of instrumental origin we
occasionally restrict these energy bands until these features did no
longer impact on our fit results. In Table  we report the
exact energy bands used for the PCA and the HEXTE datasets for the
selected spectra.
The choose to assign an appropriated systematic error for the PCA data
is an essential step in the analysis of the spectra. This operation is
not straightforward, as the commonly used standard candle, the Crab,
provides in this case only a partial calibration tool. The Crab
countrate for every energy channel below FORMULA  20 keV is about one
order of magnitude less than the Scorpius X-1  countrate, thus making the
extrapolation of the Crab based systematic error to the Scorpius X-1 
spectra riskful. The mostly adopted view to assign a 1% systematic
error for all the energy channels has a strong impact on the softer
part of the spectrum, where there are the mostly weighted channels; we
found that in this case the fit is strongly driven by residuals in
the 3-6 keV range, leading to a modelization of the spectrum that does
not seem physically plausible. The overall effect is a shift of any
soft component outside the RXTE energy band, and unrealistic high
values for the extrapolated flux.
The only way to avoid the strong driving effect of the first channels
is to arbitrarily raise the systematics in this range; we found that
assigning a 3% systematic error for channels between 3 and 3.9 keV
(namely the first two PCA channels available in our spectra), while
leaving a 1 % systematic error for all the other channels, allows to
derive a physically plausible scenario for the spectral evolution of
the source, does not result in extreme lower/higher values of reduced
FORMULA  for every fit performed, allows us to exploit all the
available energy band and to generally constrain all the spectral
components of the adopted models. We occasionally still found in some
fits systematical residuals in the soft part of the spectrum, that are
more stressed in the softer spectra, whose origin can be presumedly
instrumental and related to the xenon L-edge near 5 keV. We choose to
ignore these effects, in order to not overparameterize the fit, as
they do not influence the determination of the spectral parameters and
do not impact the FORMULA  values of the fits.
No systematic error has been associated to the HEXTE data. A
normalization constant is left free to vary between the PCU2 and HEXTE
spectra to take into account residual flux calibration uncertainties.

Spectral models
As pointed out in
Section 1, spectra of LMXBs are usually described as the sum of at
least two spectral components. Because the PCA energy band starts
from 3 keV, it is not possible to constrain the effect of the
photoelectric interstellar absorption on the source flux. Following
{{cite:ba05f5bf-8375-4c4b-9393-ed136ea53ec6}}, we fixed its value to 3 FORMULA  10FORMULA 
cmFORMULA , for each fit performed. To fit the CDs selected spectra,
we tried at first a series of models given by the combination of a
soft thermal component, such as a blackbody or multicolor disk
blackbody {{cite:009af860-f0a1-49f8-ae9e-5963ac6621a9}}, and a thermal
Comptonized component. For the latter we, alternatively, tried the
COMPPS {{cite:2683bc36-c2b2-42d0-bbf2-69d96ae66faa}}, COMPTT
{{cite:307249be-f91f-4002-82f6-32526fa21836}} and THCOMP  {{cite:40a0a837-edbd-49c7-91d6-ffc9c650a0fd}} Comptonization models.
For any model adopted, large residuals in the 6–10 keV energy range
indicated the presence of iron features, that we simply modelled
with a broad Gaussian line in the 6–7 keV energy range. We noted a
general tendency for any adopted model to have a very broad Gaussian
line (with FORMULA  keV) and, generally, with centroids at
energies FORMULA  keV. In order to avoid unrealistically large
Gaussian lines, absorbing the underneath continuum, we constrained
the line to have centroid energies only in the 6.4–7.0 keV energy
range, with a line width less than 0.8 keV, while the normalization
of the line was a completely free to vary parameter.
We found an adequate description of the data, for energies below 30
keV, using a two-component model given by the combination of the
DISKBB  and the COMPTTcomponents, a modelization that was
firstly introduced by {{cite:009af860-f0a1-49f8-ae9e-5963ac6621a9}}, and that is known as the
Eastern model. Other Comptonization models can also
statistically equally well represent the spectral sample, but we
preferred to illustrate our results using this Compton model as it
is one of the mostly used in the LMXBs spectral analysis and allows
an easy way to compare our results with results obtained for other
sources.
Using the other often used modelization, the Western model
{{cite:4b7ac21c-b09f-4182-a501-a5b00f8c6963}} that predicts a FORMULA  1–2 keV blackbody thermal
emission and a Comptonization component with disk soft seed-photon in
the 0.4–0.8 keV energy range {{cite:7980ccd6-bc8b-46c8-ab18-b53f48ce1e4c}}, we found
higher FORMULA  values for each spectrum and an extrapolated
super-Eddington luminosity along each part of the Z-track, that would
be dramatic for some FB spectra which would overcome by more that an
order of magnitude the Eddington limit, thus making this assumption
not realistic. Moreover, the power dissipated in the Comptonizing
disk corona would be constantly much greater than the power dissipated
as thermal emission on the NS-surface and this breaks our expectations
that the power dissipated near the compact object should be at least
of the same order of the power dissipated along the disk, if the disk
is very close to the NS {{cite:d9c073ca-10fc-493d-9a45-85210469ffc8}}.
The DISKBB  has two free parameters, the temperature expressed in keV
at the inner disk radius (kTFORMULA ) and a normalization factor that
depends on the inner radius of the accretion disk, the distance from
the source and the inclination angle between the line of sight and the
normal to the disk; the COMPTT  has four free parameters: the soft
seed photon temperature, kTFORMULA , the electron temperature of the
Comptonizing cloud, kTFORMULA , the optical depth, FORMULA , and a
normalization constant. We assumed that the Comptonizing geometry is
spherical. We will refer to this two-component model as the DBBTT 
model.
As it is evident from Table   the DBBTT  model is, however,
gradually unable to satisfactorily fit the whole energy spectrum as
the source resides in zones of low inferred accretion rate. The
residuals, with respect to this model, clearly indicated an excess of
flux at energies greater than 30 keV. There is also a second group of
spectra (namely spectra 7,8,12,13 and 26) that gave for the same
reason an unsatisfactory high FORMULA  value. These spectra lie at the
top of the FB in the datasets that have the higher HEXTE statistics.
We will refer to this particular set as the top-FB spectra.
Because the mechanisms producing this hard excess in the Z sources are
not clear yet, in the following we will adopt two working hypothesises
to fit the broadband continuum of the source: a) as in the case of the
quasi saturated boundary layer Comptonization, this component is also
the result of a thermal Comptonization process, but from a much hotter
plasma; b) a broad band spectrum is the result of a hybrid electron
velocity distribution, i.e. a thermal electron distribution, which
produces the optically thick Comptonization, with a power-law
non-thermal tail which is responsible for the high-energy excess.
Because, for case a), the hot plasma can only reside in regions close
to the central compact object, where magnetic and gravitational
effects are the strongest, we assume that the boundary layer radiation
field is the primary source of soft-seed photons also for this second
thermal Comptonization. We note that this assumption is also needed
in order to avoid an overestimation of the contribution of steep hard
tail at low energies. The use of an unbroken power-law at steep
photon indeces can give a major contribution in the lowest energy band
of the spectrum so that the fit is driven by low-energy residuals,
possibly resulting in an erroneous continuum modelization.
Thereafter, a low-energy cutoff at the seed-photon temperature must be
taken into account as the expected photon field spectrum is within the
instrumental range.
We added, thereafter, to our basic two-component model, a power-law in
order to mimic this second Comptonization, multiplied by a low-energy
cut-off. We set the value of the low-energy cut-off anchored to the
kTFORMULA  value of the COMPTT  component, while we choose the power-law
to have a pegged normalization expressed as flux of this component in
the 20.0–200.0 keV energy range (PEGPWRLW, in XSPEC). We checked
for each spectrum the FORMULA  improvement by adding a high energy
cutoff, noting that we could obtain only lower limits on the cutoff
energy, generally in the 30–100 keV range without any significant
improvement in the FORMULA . Thereafter we did not use a high energy
cutoff. We will refer at this model simply as DBBTTPEG  or
two Comptonizations model.
To model the possibility given in case b) we also fitted the spectra
showing a strong hard excess (namely spectra for which the DBBTT 
model gave a null hypotesis probability less than 0.05 (it generally
corresponded to a reduced FORMULA  value of 1.4) with a model given by
the sum of a thermal disk component plus the recently developed
thermal/nonthermal hybrid Comptonization model named EQPAIR 
{{cite:b8039c86-bfc0-4ff4-80d7-6b44ee414b3a}}, {{cite:2b7a2696-4ca0-4f45-867e-328bf9c5b9f9}}.
It embodies Compton scattering, FORMULA  pair production and
annihilation, FORMULA  and FORMULA  thermal and non-thermal
bremsstrahlung, and energy exchange between thermal and non-thermal
parts of the FORMULA  distribution via Coulomb scattering. Selected
electrons are accelerated to suprathermal energies and the thermal
part of the FORMULA  distribution can be additionally heated. This
model assumes a spherical plasma cloud with isotropic and homogeneous
distribution of photons and FORMULA , and soft seed photons produced
uniformly within the plasma, with a thermal temperature of FORMULA .
The properties of the plasma depend on its compactness, FORMULA  where
FORMULA  is the total power in the source, FORMULA  is the
radius of the sphere and FORMULA  is the Thomson cross section. The
compactness is divided in a hard compactness, FORMULA , which
corresponds to the power supplied to the electrons, and a soft
compactness, FORMULA , corresponding to the power supplied in the
form of soft photons. The compactnesses corresponding to the electron
acceleration and to the additional heating of the thermal part of the
FORMULA  distribution are denoted as FORMULA  and FORMULA , respectively, and FORMULA . The non-thermal energy distribution of the electrons in
the plasma is assumed to be a power law replacing the Maxwellian
exponential tail from a gamma Lorentz factor FORMULA  up
to a FORMULA  with an energy index FORMULA . The total
Thomson optical depth and the electron temperature of the plasma are
computed self-consistently from the assumed optical depth FORMULA  of
the background electron-proton plasma.
We choose to model the thermal disk emission using as in the hot
Comptonization model the DISKBB  component for spectra in HB/NB,
while we adopted the post-Newtonian model DISKPN 
{{cite:a8dce823-1c9c-4bd9-b030-8546b3850e9a}} in the case of the topFB spectra, as, in this
accretion state, we expect the disk to reach its minimum inner disk
radius, close to the NS; the DISKPN  model takes into account the
effective gravitational potential in the neighborhood of the compact
object by computing the emergent disk spectrum using a more
appropriate post-Newtonian potential. We assumed that the disk
reaches the last stable orbit at 6 RFORMULA  and fixed this parameter for
the fits performed, while we left free to vary the maximum disk
temperature (TFORMULA ) and a normalization factor (K = FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the central mass expressed in solar units,
FORMULA  is the inclination of the disk, FORMULA  is the distance to the source
in kpc, FORMULA  the color/effective temperature). We have left free
to vary for the EQPAIR  component the following parameters:
FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  and the normalization
factor. The FORMULA  was not very sensible to variations in the
range between 1.5 and 3 for spectra in the HB/NB, while for the topFB
spectra had to be left as a free to vary parameter, as this gave a
significant decrease in the FORMULA  when left as a free to vary
parameter. The value of the soft compactness FORMULA  was
unconstrained by the fit (it is mainly driven by the pair production
rate, which manifests itself with the annihilation line at energies
FORMULA  500 keV, obviously far beyond our energy limits), and we kept
it frozen at the value of 10 {{cite:a8dce823-1c9c-4bd9-b030-8546b3850e9a}}. All
the other parameters of the model were frozen at the default values.
We will refer to this modelization as the DBBEQPAIR  model, or simply,
the hybrid Comptonization model.

 We report in this table, from the left to the right
column, the chosen identifying number of the CDs selected spectra
(as shown in Figure REF ) together with the associated
observational dataset, its exposure times, the relative background
subtracted countrates for the PCA and HEXTE, the energy band
considered in the fits and the reduced FORMULA  values obtained from
the fits, adopting the DBBTT, the DBBTTPEG  and the DBBEQPAIR 
model; the degrees of freedom (dof) for each fit are shown in
parenthesis.

We have examined 43 energy spectra of Scorpius X-1  in the 3.0–200 keV energy
band using RXTE pointed observations from April 1997 to August 2003;
the spectra have been extracted from selected regions chosen in the
X-ray CD. We produced a CD for each close in time dataset in order to
avoid shifts of instrumental origin, and repeated our analysis for
each CD obtained in this way, thus having at hand a robust
representation of the spectral evolution of the source in all its
accretion states.
To fit the spectra we firstly adopted a two-component model given by
the sum of a soft thermal disk emission and a hard Comptonized
emission. We checked for the presence of harder X-ray emission by
adding a high-energy power-law to our basic model, while for a subset
of spectra we adopted a hybrid thermal/non-thermal Comptonization as
described in the previous section.
We find that the basic two-component model DBBTT  can fit the 3-200
keV energy band spectrum (fits for which we obtained a FORMULA ) in 25 out of a total 43 spectra; these spectra mostly
belong to the FB and to the NB. Hard tails, in this group of spectra,
are not significantly detected in 14 spectra (these are spectra 1, 9,
14, 15, 17, 18, 22, 23, 24, 29, 34, 35, 39, 40, see Table )
when the source lies in the FB/NB apex of its CD. For the other 11
spectra, although the addition of a new component is not strictly
required by the fit, we found a general improvement in the FORMULA 
value.
On the contrary, we find that this model fails to describe the spectra
in 18 of the 43 selected spectra (fits for which we obtained a
FORMULA ); the fits generally getting worse and worse
from the bottom of the FB to the upper NB. From the residuals with
respect to this model, it is clearly seen an excess of hard emission
at energies above 30 keV. We report in Figure REF  four
representative deconvolved spectra for the case in which the DBBTT 
model does not give an adequate description to the broad-band spectral
behavior, choosing three spectra from the HB/NB zone and one for the
topFB zone: spectrum 06 (at the top of the left track of dataset
20035A), spectrum 16 (at the top of the left track of dataset 30036),
spectrum 31 (at the top of the left track of dataset 40020) and
spectrum 07 (at the top of the right track of dataset 20035B).
In the following we will group the spectra according to the relative
position in their CDs, in: topFB spectra (spectra 7, 8, 12, 13, 17,
22, 26, 32, 37), FB spectra (1, 9, 14, 18, 27, 28, 33, 38), NB spectra
(2, 3, 10, 15, 19, 20, 23, 24, 29, 30, 34, 35, 39, 40) and HB spectra
(4, 5, 6, 11, 16, 21, 25, 31, 36, 41, 42, 43). We caution the reader
that this distinction is based only on the results of our spectral
analysis for spectra taken in particular zones of the Z-track, without
any reference to the temporal behavior of the source. Although it is
clear, looking just at the lightcurves, to distinguish within one
dataset the FB from the NB, the distinction between the NB and the HB
is rather subtle, as the two track mostly overlap. For this reason a
HB spectrum, for this analysis, is to be considered only as a
simple label for a spectrum extracted from the top part of left
track of each CD.

The hot Comptonization model
Energetics
In the following we will discuss the fit results based on the adopted
model DBBTTPEG. Although in some spectra this model over-parameterizes
the fit, the spectral behavior of the source and our conclusions would
not change, if we used the best-fitting values of the DBBTT 
modelization (we show in Table  and  the best-fit values of the
spectral parameter, together with associated errors quoted at 90%
confidence level). In some cases we had to freeze some parameters in
order to make the fit physically consistent and avoid solutions
without physical meaning. In spectra 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 37, 38 the
electron temperature had to be fixed to 10 keV (a value consistent
with what we found in other CDs for the same CD zone; if free the fit
would give a best-fit with kTFORMULA  kTFORMULA  which is clearly wrong),
the photon index of the PEGPWRLW  component in spectra where this
component is not significantly detected, or when its value is
unconstrained by the fit, is frozen to a reference value of 2; the
DISKBB  parameters of spectra 42 and 43 had to be fixed to the
best-values as obtained by the best-fit model DBBTT  (if free, this
component vanishes, while the COMPTT  and PEGPWRLW  have comparable
flux values).
In this spectral decomposition we calculated
the total luminosity as follows:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the COMPTT  flux and FORMULA  is the PEGPWRLW 
flux extrapolated in the 0.1–200 keV energy range; FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the spectral hardening factor
{{cite:ffa7c0a3-2774-412c-aa37-d29b587277e7}}, is assumed equal to 1.7, and FORMULA 
corrects for the fact that the radius at which is reached the maximum
temperature is greater than the inner disk distance
{{cite:d6e44b9c-ab9d-4c5e-a785-932b7e15c1a0}}. FORMULA  is a constant dependent on the distance of
the source, which we assumed to be 2.8 kpc, and the inclination of the
disk, which we assumed 45FORMULA . In Figure REF  we show the
contribution of the disk and of the Comptonized component to the total
flux. The luminosities on both axis are in Eddington units for a 1.4
FORMULA .
The source span a luminosity range between 0.9 LFORMULA  and 2.4
LFORMULA , thus being in a super-Eddington state almost independently
of the position of the source on the CD. We note that the only way to
drastically reduce this range is to suppose a much massive compact
object (the possibility of a massive NS hosted in the Scorpius X-1  system is
also discussed in {{cite:7c3500ef-20b8-42cc-85e8-9dfa6a72fa4b}} in the framework of the
relativistic precession model used to explain the frequencies of
quasi-periodic oscillations in NSs and BH systems) given that both the
distance and the inclination angle are known with good accuracy (10%
and 13% relative error, respectively).
The disk flux and the hard flux correlate as expected with the total
flux, although the disk emission presents a more pronounced linear
relation, while the hard flux seems to saturate as the total flux
reaches the highest values. If we assume a linear dependency of the
two contributions versus the total emission we derive a constant of
proportionality equals to 0.56 for the disk flux and 0.44 for the
Comptonized flux. When we look at the ratio of the two contributions
along the Z-track (see Figure REF , a 5% error on this ratio
is assumed, after having tested the corresponding hard and soft flux
values for different parameter values of the spectral components
inside the uncertainties errorbars as derived from the fits), there is
a general trend to have a higher hard/soft ratio as the source moves
from higher to lower accretion states; this is in agreement with our
expectation that, at lower accretion rate the disk could be truncated
and the fraction of the power dissipated in the boundary layer should
correspondently increase. Spectra 7, 12, 13 and 32 do not follow this
trend; these spectra belong to the topFB spectra, and in these cases,
we are possibly, underestimating the disk contribution, or
overestimating the hard flux.
FIGURE 
FIGURE 

Disk emission and thermal Comptonization
We present in Figure REF  the dependency of the inner disk
radius and of the inner disk temperature, plotted against the
hard/soft luminosity ratio. It is shown, both in Table
 ,  and in Figure  REF , the apparent
radius, derived without considering important correction factors, due
to the color/effective temperature ratio, relativistic effects, and
the non-zero torque boundary conditions; moreover, it should be noted
that these corrective factors can also vary, depending on the
accretion state. The sum of all these effects could be a drastical
rescale of the measured inner radii up to almost an order of magnitude
higher {{cite:7a6b956d-9522-4d50-8014-b4279472f463}}, but the general trend that correlates this
parameter with the accretion state of the source should be
qualitatively preserved.
The apparent inner disk radius, for spectra in the topFB has the
lowest values, FORMULA  10 km, while the average value for NB spectra
and HB spectra is considerably higher (average value: FORMULA  18 km for
the HB and NB, FORMULA  13.5 km for the FB and FORMULA  10.2 km for the
topFB). The inner disk temperature, on the other hand, presents the
highest values, as one could expect, on the FB, while the temperature
diminishes with the accretion rate. A small subset of FB spectra falls
out of the trend, but as pointed out earlier, in this case, the exact
determination of the relative contributions of the two components
could suffer of systematic uncertainties linked to the particularly
luminous state of the source. On the FB the disk temperature has an
average value of 2.12 keV, while on the lower part of the FB sinks to
1.73 keV. There is not any appreciable difference on temperature for
spectra taken on the NB and on the HB with an average value of 1.43
keV.
FIGURE 
For the hard, thermal Comptonized, component the accurate
determination of all the spectral parameters was not always possible.
The soft-seed photon temperature presents, for each spectra analyzed,
a substantially higher value with respect to the disk temperature at
the inner radius. We hence propose that the soft photons are
originated from the boundary layer/NS surface, partially thermalized
with the softer photons of inner part of the accretion disk around the
NS. Moreover, calculating the radius of the soft-seed photons emitting
region FORMULA  from:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the distance to the source in kpc, FORMULA  is the
COMPTT  bolometric flux and FORMULA  (see Eq. REF ), the Compton
parameter, we derived for our sample values in the 3–6 km range, that
clearly indicate a rather small emitting region, thus supporting our
identification.
FIGURE 
The CD correlated changing of the thermal temperatures is compatible
with a scenario in which the position of the source on the CD is
determined by the instantaneous FORMULA , and higher accretion rates
correspond to higher seed-photons temperatures, resulting in a hotter
radiation field. The soft seed-photon temperature has a 2.2 keV,
2.4 keV, 2.9 keV average values for spectra on the HB/NB, FB and topFB
respectfully. When plotted against each other, the disk temperature
and the soft seed-photon temperature (see Figure REF , left panel)
follow each other quite closely, being these two parameters the main
driving physical quantities related to the accretion state of the
source. The correlation between the CD resolved spectra and the two
temperatures shows, although in a qualitative representation, that the
link between the spectral evolution of the source and its accretion
state is well motivated.
FIGURE 
The other two spectral parameters, that describe the high-energy
curvature of the Comptonized component, the electron temperature of
the Comptonizing plasma (kTFORMULA ) and the optical depth of the cloud
FORMULA , are not always well constrained by the fit. As it is evident
from Figure REF , for spectra at high accretion rate we obtained
high values for the electron temperature (kTFORMULA  10 keV) and low
values for the optical depth (FORMULA  1). As the sources resides
on zones of lower FORMULA , the Comptonizing cloud substantially
thickens, while the electron temperature correspondently diminishes.
Plotting the subset of the spectra in the NB and HB helps to better
visualize this tendency (Figure  REF , right panel). It is to
be noted that the determination of these two parameters is partially
related with the hard power-law component; although there are spectra
where the PEGPWRLW  component is not strictly necessary for a good
fit, its introduction slightly shifts the the thermal Comptonized
component to lower energies, thus giving a noticeable reduction in the
uncertainties of the Compton curvature.
In all the spectra it is required a Gaussian line at energies FORMULA 
6.4 keV. It mostly appear rather broad, with a line width that often
reaches our constraint of 0.8 keV. The equivalent widths associated
with the line are in 80-200 eV range, and are to be taken as rather
indicative given the low energy resolution of the PCA and the presence
of systematic residuals in this energy range.

The hard tail behavior
The presence of a hard X-ray excess in the extracted spectra of Scorpius X-1 
is mostly evident in 18 spectra from a total of 43 CD selected spectra.
There is little evidence of the presence of hard X-ray excess for
spectra lying in the bottom part of the FB and of the NB, namely for
spectra taken near the apex that connects the left and right track
that compose the V pattern.
In all the examined CD patterns we always detect a power-law
high-energy excess, dominant above FORMULA  40 keV, as the source
resides at the top of the left track, i.e.  a portion of the diagram
that we tentatively identified with the HB, and which should
correspond to the lowest mass accretion rate. This group of spectra
are characterized by the lowest values of inner disk temperature and
soft seed-photon temperature; the derived inner disk radii correspond
to a disk truncated at about 10-15 RFORMULA , while the Comptonizing
optical cloud is substantially thicker with respect to any other
spectrum in other zones of the CD; the fraction of the total power
dissipated in the Comptonizing corona has the highest values, with a
ratio hard/soft luminosity well above unity.
FIGURE 
Apart from this consistent group of HB/NB spectra, we also found a
minor group of spectra (namely 5 spectra: 7, 8, 12, 13 and 26), for
which the fit required a third high-energy component. These spectra
belong to 3 CDs (20035B, 30036 and 40020) and are spectra taken at the
top of the FB. Although these spectra are located in the same CD
region, not all the CD that display a topFB clearly show this excess.
This could be due to a statistical reason, as in all the other CDs the
HEXTE countrate (see Table  ) drops of about one order of
magnitude with respect to these 3 CDs; because the countrate is
essentially concentrated in the 20–35 keV energy band, that is the
range that constrains the curvature of the thermal Comptonized
component, the energy channels in this energy band with a high
statistic will drive the fit, and any small excess above the
exponential tail of the Comptonized component will statistically be
more accentuated. However, we cannot exclude that an opposite
reasoning is true, i.e. that we are underestimating instrumental
effects that appear only for higher count-rates as dead-time
corrections or poor background estimate, so that these particular hard
tails are artifacts of an incorrect modelization of the thermal
Comptonization curvature. As we have no apparent way to better
calibrate our spectra, we discuss also the appearance of this
component for this group of spectra. Future observations with other
high-energy satellites, such as INTEGRAL or SUZAKU, will test if this
particular topFB state of the source is also accompanied by a high
energy excess or it is an HEXTE faked detection.
The hard excess has no evident relation with the total luminosity of
the source, but this could be expected since the different zones of
the CD track are not related with the total X-ray luminosity. Using
the pegged power-law, we directly derived from the normalization value
of this component, the flux in the 20.0-200.0 keV energy band. We
show in Figure REF , left panel, the hard tails luminosity in the
20–200 keV range vs. the hard/soft ratio. From the plot it can be
clearly seen that the hardening of the spectrum is reflected in the
increasing luminosity of the hard-tail component; the CD resolved
spectra are, correspondently, disposed on this plot: the FB spectra
reside on the bottom left of the diagram with hard fluxes FORMULA  erg sFORMULA , NB spectra are harder and half of them
show significant fluxes (FORMULA  erg sFORMULA ), while
the HB spectra, in the right part of the plot, show the strongest hard
X-ray emission (in the range 6–12 FORMULA  erg sFORMULA ).
As pointed out in the previous section, we found for the topFB sample,
spectra with no detectable hard X-ray emission, that occupy the left
bottom part of this figure and that smoothly join the correlation
between hard/soft ratio and hard flux and spectra that do not follow
this trend and for which there is both in the COMPTT  and in the
PEGPWRLW  component a hard flux higher than we expected. From the
figure is also evident that one of the most luminous hard tail is
found in a particular spectrum on the topFB (namely spectrum 26 of CD
40020); the luminosity of this component is related to the total
broad-band high luminous state of the source, that reaches in this
case the highest value of total luminosity (2.6 LFORMULA ) observed in
our sample.
On the other hand, the values of the photon index present a well
defined bimodal distribution according to the position of the source
on the CD. We find quite flat power-laws, with index values less that
unity for all the FB and topFB spectra, while for the other group of
spectra, values generally range between 1.5 and 2 (Figure REF ,
right panel).

The hybrid Comptonization model
Models of hybrid Comptonization have so far been mostly adopted to
explain state transitions both in black-hole candidate systems (as in
Cyg X-1, {{cite:a8dce823-1c9c-4bd9-b030-8546b3850e9a}}; GRS 1915+105, {{cite:df943a55-f38d-4e1d-87c6-321fbbf80d3f}};
or GX 339+4, {{cite:a0be91e0-4db2-4dec-995c-944292740020}}) and in NS system {{cite:39903f8f-cc8e-4f47-90c6-90b78630b3a2}}.
We tried to model the spectra for which we detected a hard tail,
making the hypothesis that both the hard tail and the thermal
Comptonized component were related to each other. In this way, all the
broad-band evolution of the source is covered in a self-consistent way
by only two spectral components: the thermal soft disk emission and
the hard hybrid Comptonized component. In table  we present
the results of our fits for the group of 18 spectra, distinguishing
between the HB/NB group (top part of the table), for which we used the
DISKBB  component as in the case of DBBTTPEG  modelization, and the
topFB spectra, for which we used the DISKPN  component, under the
assumption that for this state the disk is not truncated, and reaches
the surface of the NS (we assumed that this happens at a distance of 6
RFORMULA ).
FIGURE 
As in the case of the previously adopted modelization, the thermal
disk temperature and the soft-seed photon temperature are the main
driving physical parameters that determine the changing of the
spectral state of the source. We show in Figure REF  (left panel),
the correlation between the two temperatures: the topFB spectra occupy
the top right part of the plot, with an average FORMULA  value of
2.73 keV and inner disk temperature FORMULA  of 1.97 keV, while the
set of the HB-NB spectra are disposed along a linear trend in the
1.2-1.8 keV energy range for the disk temperature and 1.9-2.5 keV
range for the soft seed-photon temperature. The plot closely follows
the plot of Figure REF , right panel.
The hard compactness FORMULA  results for all the examined spectra
only a small fraction of the soft compactness FORMULA , with values
of hard/soft ratio FORMULA  below 0.2. The HB/NB spectra span
almost an order of magnitude in the FORMULA  range, while the topFB
spectra are all grouped in a more narrow range of values, around FORMULA  = 0.6–0.8 (see Figure REF , right panel).
The two groups of spectra significantly differ both in the FORMULA  and
FORMULA  values (it is to be noted, however, that the
optical depth reported from the fits has not the same physical meaning
of the classical Thomson optical depth of the Comptonizing cloud, as
it more properly refers to the optical depth associated with the
background photon radiation field): HB spectra present generally
higher values of optical depth (with an average value of FORMULA 
2.2) and a hybrid electron distribution (with 0.3 FORMULA  0.8, and an average value of 0.55), while the
topFB spectra have considerably lower values of FORMULA  and
essentially non-thermal spectra, with FORMULA . The
slope of the high-energy power-law of the hybrid electron
distribution, FORMULA  is consistent with a value of 2, for the
HB-NB spectra, while for the topFB spectra its value is considerably
lower (between 0 and 1).
FIGURE 

Conclusions
We outline our main conclusions from an extensive analysis of Scorpius X-1 
RXTE observations in the 3–200 keV energy range: we observe a
spectral evolution of the source that is clearly dependent on the
position of the source along its CD track; the spectral decomposition
consists of four different spectral components that we interpret, from
the softest to the highest X-rays respectively, as follows: a soft
thermal component from an optically thick accretion disk, a thermal
Comptonization from the boundary layer, a reflection component which
mainly manifests in a broad Gaussian line at 6.4 keV and a variable
hard excess above 30 keV, mostly present at low FORMULA .
We have shown that the CD correlated variations of the two thermal
temperatures (disk temperature and soft seed-photon temperature), the
trend in the hard/soft ratio, the Compton thickening of the
Comptonizing cloud and the apparency of significant hard X-ray
emission on the HB/NB are the main spectral characteristics of the
source.
We paid particular attention to the modelization of the hardest X-ray
component, which is of primary importance for the understanding of all
the continuum emission, as it has a major impact on the determination
of all the other spectral parameters. To fit this hard excess we
modelled our spectra using a phenomenological component, i.e. a
power-law with a low energy exponential cut-off at the seed-photon
temperature and a self-consistent physical model, a hybrid
thermal/non-thermal Comptonization code. In both cases we found an
adequate description of the spectra for each source state, and the two
modelizations are statistically equivalent.
The use of simple power-laws to fit the hard tails in the Z-class
sources, but also in some atolls {{cite:c4a1011b-84a3-4b6a-8a38-b2c5a278bae3}}, {{cite:70368be5-1a6b-4a58-9047-ee16749264b2}}, has been
largely used in the past, given the lack of broad-band coverage up to
the MeV energies, and a poor understanding of the physical origins of
this component. Contrary to what previously reported {{cite:2cca9d85-750b-4b61-af7d-49480e30b800}},
the presence of the hard tail FORMULA  related to the broad-band spectral
evolution of the source as inferred from the source position on the Z
track of its CD: the presence and the values of the photon indexes in
Scorpius X-1  are consistent with the results from fits to spectra on the same
zone of the CD for the other Z sources {{cite:658f8184-3f0c-4db5-a5fb-60c02a4f75c3}}, {{cite:244369d7-e9a4-449b-9af8-4aa9c6ca86cc}}, {{cite:1f099581-94b6-49b0-a9ae-85aa8974c9a8}}, {{cite:2abb1588-548d-47f4-b2b1-4eb52dc279b9}}; at the same time, the flux contribution to
the total energy output of the sources is of the same order and is
anticorrelated to the inferred mass accretion rate. This is clearly
shown in the case of the CD 20035A, where the hard tail flux
monotonically increases as the source moves from the bottom to the top
of its NB/HB.
The only difference, between Scorpius X-1  and the other similar sources, is
constituted by rather flat hard tails that we found when the source is
at the top of the FB and which has never been observed in other NSs
sources; however, while for every CD that we obtained, we
systematically found a hard tail as the source was at the top of left
V track, the detection on the FB is presumedly dependent on the HEXTE
statistics. Past surveys with the use of scintillation counters
on-board on balloons reported the unusual flattening of the spectrum
of Scorpius X-1  above 40 keV {{cite:aae7968c-698b-49fb-85a7-aa3407e73862}}, as well as more recent
surveys {{cite:9117455f-3fec-4a9f-aedd-ccfd64a77015}}; it would be interesting to definitively
assess the existence of such component; from our analysis, we can only
conjecture that this component, could be a signature, on the FB, of
the trespassing of the Eddington limit on the interface between the
accretion disk and the board of the boundary layer, followed by a
violent expulsion of part of the accreting matter.
Hard tails on the HB could have a thermal origin, as in the case of
the thermal Comptonized component that dominates the spectrum at lower
energies (less than 20 keV); in this case the power-law, as long as
the optical depth is low and the electron temperature is not too high,
is a good approximation of the Comptonized spectrum, whose FORMULA 
parameter
FORMULA 
is related to the photon index of the power-law by the following relation:
FORMULA 
In the case of Scorpius X-1  spectra on the HB/NB, we derived photon indexes
in the 1.8–2.2 range, that imply a FORMULA  Compton parameter in the
0.6–1.1 range; a FORMULA  thick plasma would then require a FORMULA 
50 keV thermal plasma, while a FORMULA , on the contrary, a FORMULA 
15 keV electron temperature. We did not find any evidence of
high-energy cut-off, obtaining only lower limits in the 50–100 keV
energy range, and this constraints the optical depth to be less than
one while the electron temperature would be greater than 50 keV. The
formation of hot zones, or blobs, of very hot plasma, possibly powered
by episodes of magnetic reconnection above the disk, constitutes a
plausible scenario {{cite:a4f175c5-521d-4dc8-b844-1de13e3a9a10}}; this model has been also proposed
in the case of the hard/low states of BH candidates {{cite:d410fa66-4b5a-446e-aa27-9fac36ae85ec}},
which share with the bright Z-sources systems, from a spectral point
of view, similar values of the hard photon indexes and the low
accretion state, while they naturally differ from the strong boundary
layer emission present in the NSs sources and absent in the BH case.
A thermal origin, on the other hand, for the topFB hard tails seems to
be excluded, as it would require unrealistic large values of the
electron temperature.
Our analysis has shown that this scenario is statistically equivalent
to a hybrid Comptonization model, where the non-thermal fraction of
the power injected in the electron heating counts up to half of
the total injected power. The non-thermal fraction is significantly
higher with respect to the value found by {{cite:39903f8f-cc8e-4f47-90c6-90b78630b3a2}} in the
case of GX 17+2. The non-thermal fraction for the topFB spectra must
be distinguished from the non-thermal spectra of the BH sources, as in
the case of Scorpius X-1, the hard luminosity is a small fraction of the soft
luminosity, that dominates the 10–30 keV energy spectrum. Most of the
soft photons do not Compton interact with the electron cloud, because
of the low optical depth values.
Another possible physical mechanism to explain the hard X-ray
variability is the bulk motion Comptonization
{{cite:36706efa-30a5-45dd-93c0-a360fb408dc3}}, present in systems with a high velocity
radial accretion flows. This radiation mechanism, used to explain the
hard power-law component in BH systems spectra in their soft/high
states, is, however, not able to account for the the absence of any
cut-off up to energies of 0.5 MeV and for the hard photon indexes
observed (FORMULA  2.0) {{cite:76edb2ab-d2b6-4fa8-a68c-ac567138708c}}. In the case of
bright NS systems, the high radiation pressure of the inner boundary
layer constitutes a strong barrier for any incoming convergent bulk
motion flow. On the other side, because jets have been observed in
the radio from Scorpius X-1, bulk motion Comptonization inside the jet can be
an important production mechanisms also of hard X-ray radiation.
Theoretical spectra and energetic contribution according to the
relevant physical parameters involved in the case of a strict coupling
with inflow (i.e. accretion to the compact object through the
formation of an accretion disk) and outflow (i.e. jets), are a
promising way to cover in a self-consistent way all the phases of
accretion. Details about the geometry of the scattering media, amount
of reflection on the cold disk and dependence from the accretion state
of the source are yet to be fully explored. Moreover, in this case
synchrotron emission of soft photons by a beamed population of
relativistic electrons becomes a competitive source of photons with
respect to the thermal soft photon emission of the boundary layer and
accretion disk. An attempt to explicitly compute a jet spectrum, from
radio to hard X-rays, has been recently proposed by {{cite:1561ae32-34c7-45a3-b306-04497eb6a2a6}},
where the jet base subsumes the role of the static Comptonizing
corona; spectral fits in the case of BH systems (namely Cyg X-1 and GX
339-4) in hard states are consistent with this scenario, but BH soft
states and NS systems spectra need yet to be tested in order to
understand the limits of validity of the jet model.
Questions to be further addressed in future observations are: the exact
shape and contribution of the soft component below the 3 keV range,
the investigation with good spectral resolution in the 6–10 keV range
of the reflection features, the extension up to 0.5 MeV of the
spectral coverage in order to constrain the physical parameters
characterizing the non-thermal electron distribution of the
Comptonizing plasma. The latter point is well within the capabilities
of the recently launched SUZAKU satellite, so that future observations
in this direction can be a stringent test to our conclusions.

model DBBEQPAIR  for the selected spectra on the HB/NB (first part
of the table) and for spectra on the top of the FB (second part of
the table). The model for the five FB spectra differs from the one
adopted for the HB/NB spectra, as it uses a more appropriate disk
emission model (DISKPN, in XSPEC) instead of the DISKBB 
component. For the DISKBB  component we list the derived apparent
inner disk radii in km, while for the spectra fitted with the
DISKPN  component, the inner disk radius has been fixed to 6 RFORMULA 
and the second column shows the value of the normalizion of the
component in units of  FORMULAFORMULA  cos(i)/(DFORMULA ),
where the distance is given in kpc, FORMULA  is the color/effective
temperature and FORMULA  is the inclination angle of the disk. The
unabsorbed flux of the EQPAIR  component has been calculated in the
0.1–200 keV energy range and it is in units of FORMULA  erg
cmFORMULA  sFORMULA . See Section   for an
explanation of all the other parameters involved in the fits. All
the uncertainties are calculated at 90% confidence level.
