A study of the FORMULA  reaction
in the energy range where the recent data from Uppsala are available,
is done in the two-step model of FORMULA  production including the final
state interaction. The FORMULA  final state interaction is incorporated
through the solution of the Lippmann Schwinger equation using an
elastic scattering matrix element, FORMULA ,
which is required to be half off-shell. It is written in a factorized
form, with an off-shell form factor multiplying an on-shell part given
by an effective range expansion up to the fourth power in momentum. The
parameters of this expansion have been taken from an existing
recent relativistic Faddeev equation solution for the FORMULA 
system corresponding to different FORMULA  scattering amplitudes.
Calculations have also been done using few body equations
within a finite rank approximation (FRA) to generate
FORMULA . The FORMULA  final state interaction
is included in the spirit of the Watson-Migdal prescription by
multiplying the matrix element by the inverse of the Jost function.
The FORMULA  interaction is found to be dominant in the region
of small invariant FORMULA  mass, FORMULA .
The FORMULA  interaction enhances the cross section in the whole region
of FORMULA , but is larger for large FORMULA . We find nearly
isotropic angular distributions of the proton and the deuteron in the
final state. All the above observations are in agreement with data.
The production mechanism for the entire range of the existing data on
the FORMULA  reaction seems to be dominated
by the two-step model of FORMULA  production.

Introduction
The current great interest in the FORMULA -nucleus interaction exists
because of the attractive nature of the FORMULA  interaction
in the s-wave {{cite:998bac82-00e0-4c87-9105-0c34a7702298}}, and the consequent possibility of the
existence of quasi-bound, virtual or resonant FORMULA -nucleus states
{{cite:fc5a0cee-da82-4ca4-9f4c-2082f7b865ce}}. The exact nature of these states, of course, depends
upon the precise knowledge of the FORMULA  scattering matrix at low
energies. As the FORMULA  is a highly unstable meson (lifetime
FORMULA ), this precise information is
difficult to obtain directly. It can only be obtained from the eta
producing reactions through the final state interaction. With this
motivation, starting with the early experiments near threshold at Saclay
on the FORMULA  and the FORMULA  reactions, measurements have been carried out near threshold
and beyond at Jülich and Uppsala using the COSY and Celsius rings
respectively. In this series of experiments, the recent
data on the FORMULA  reaction
using the Wasa/Promice setup at the Celsius storage
ring of the Svedberg laboratory, Uppsala are
thematically complete and cover the excess energy, Q,
(FORMULA ) ranging
from around threshold to 107 MeV. The data {{cite:71d596c6-5bf3-4f0d-8c40-4d64abdd890b}}
(integrated over other variables) include the
invariant mass distribution over the whole excess energy range
for the FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  systems and angular
distributions for the proton, deuteron and the eta meson.
Like the FORMULA  reaction,
the (inclusive) FORMULA  invariant mass distribution exhibits a large
enhancement near threshold and hence appears promising to
study the FORMULA  interaction. The FORMULA  and FORMULA  invariant mass
distributions do not show any such enhancement.
All observed angular distributions are nearly isotropic.
Like in our earlier studies on the FORMULA 
reaction our primary aim in this paper is to investigate the above
mentioned data on the FORMULA  invariant mass distribution to obtain a
better understanding of the FORMULA  as well as the FORMULA  interaction.
We speculate, from our experience on the study of the FORMULA  reaction {{cite:3e31d146-5a3b-4448-9d7b-1d204bbec948}}, that in the region of low FORMULA 
relative energy this set of data will be mainly determined by the
FORMULA  interaction, though the three-body nature of the final state
may introduce some uncertainty in this conclusion.
We present a study of the FORMULA  reaction which
includes the effect of the final state interaction.
We have investigated two possible diagrams for the production mechanism:
the direct mechanism and the two step process of FORMULA  production.
The direct mechanism proceeds via an intermediate FORMULA 
reaction with one of the nucleons in the deuteron as a spectator.
The FORMULA  meson in the two step model is produced in two steps, namely,
FORMULA  and FORMULA , hence
involving the participation and sharing of the transferred momentum by three
nucleons. The two step model for FORMULA  production was first used in
{{cite:af7a2102-3dee-4ace-a673-ac3e3626c5b6}} and the data on the FORMULA  reaction was
well explained. The vertices at the two steps have been described by the
corresponding off-shell FORMULA -matrices. The FORMULA -matrix for
FORMULA  is taken from a coupled channel calculation
{{cite:998bac82-00e0-4c87-9105-0c34a7702298}}, and that for FORMULA  is obtained
from the SAID program provided by the authors of Ref. {{cite:f632d2ba-297b-49d3-b466-3b83719dc89c}}.
The final state interaction between the FORMULA  and the deuteron is
explicitly incorporated through an FORMULA  FORMULA -matrix, FORMULA .
This FORMULA -matrix, which is required to be half-off-shell,
is described in two ways. One choice involves taking a “factorized form"
which is given by an off-shell form factor
multiplied by an on-shell part given by an effective range expansion up
to the fourth power in momentum. The parameters of this expansion have been
taken from an existing recent relativistic Faddeev
equation solution for the FORMULA  system {{cite:6f35e00d-adb8-4e25-a697-8f1c37ac7fe5}} corresponding to
different FORMULA  scattering amplitudes.
The off-shell form factor will be described in the next sections and is
chosen to have a form without any adjustable parameters.
The second prescription involves solving few body equations within the finite
rank approximation (FRA) to obtain FORMULA .
This approach has been used in literature for the FORMULA ,
FORMULA He and FORMULA He systems {{cite:3544746e-7373-4894-96bf-99c7665b4c37}}.
We perform calculations for both the prescriptions using different models of
the elementary coupled channel FORMULA -nucleon FORMULA -matrix which characterize
them.
The interaction between the FORMULA  meson and the proton in the
final state, to a certain extent is contained implicitly in our
calculations. This is due to the fact that we describe the
FORMULA  vertex by a FORMULA -matrix, which has been
modeled to include the FORMULA  interaction.
This off-shell FORMULA -matrix treats the FORMULA , FORMULA 
and FORMULA  channels in a coupled channel formalism
{{cite:998bac82-00e0-4c87-9105-0c34a7702298}} and reproduces the experimental data on this
reaction very well.
The effect of FORMULA  final state interaction (FSI) is incorporated in
the spirit of the Watson-Migdal FSI prescription {{cite:807a30ce-4f7a-4210-b415-b3d050f89f0d}}, in which
our model FORMULA 
production amplitude is multiplied by a factor which incorporates the
FSI between the proton and the deuteron. This factor is taken to be
the frequently used {{cite:964db363-781a-409e-a71b-ba765c91ff89}}, {{cite:6f42e8c7-8ff3-4fc1-afa9-fa1049113197}}, {{cite:3bf126b4-4a94-40bd-8eb2-66bb131bdbba}}, {{cite:6a3370b5-3f7f-4a70-8e98-5ca43bf5be85}} inverse
Jost function, FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the relative
FORMULA  momentum. The assumption implicit in this
approximation that the mechanism for the primary reaction be short
ranged is very well fulfilled in the FORMULA -production reactions.
The momentum transfer in these reactions near threshold is around
700 MeV/c. We include FSI for both doublet (FORMULA ) and quadruplet
(FORMULA ) FORMULA  states.
The FORMULA -nucleon FORMULA -matrix, which characterizes our calculations,
is not precisely known. Recent theoretical works on the
FORMULA  reaction
{{cite:91c9d123-0a87-4842-97b8-8fac0bdd3a41}} conclude that
the data on this reaction can be reproduced with the strength of the real
part of the FORMULA -nucleon
scattering length ranging between 0.42 and 0.72 fm.
In our earlier work on the FORMULA  reaction
{{cite:3e31d146-5a3b-4448-9d7b-1d204bbec948}}, we found a good agreement with data, with the real part of the
scattering length taken to be around 0.75 fm. This value was also found
to be in agreement
with the FORMULA  data in a FORMULA -matrix calculation of the
final state FORMULA  interaction in {{cite:c7e5a436-f01e-4270-bec4-04536701f7a7}}.
The same authors as in {{cite:c7e5a436-f01e-4270-bec4-04536701f7a7}}, recently performed a fit
to a wide variety of data which includes the
FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  and
FORMULA  reactions and gave their best fit
value of the FORMULA -nucleon scattering length, FORMULA  to be
FORMULA  fm {{cite:d6c7445a-a04f-4df6-9347-e00f3414747f}}. The FORMULA  effective range
parameters are given in {{cite:6f35e00d-adb8-4e25-a697-8f1c37ac7fe5}} for FORMULA  up to FORMULA  fm.
Hence, in the present work we perform calculations with different models
of the FORMULA  interaction, which correspond to three different values of
the FORMULA  scattering length, ranging from FORMULA 
fm to FORMULA  fm.
We find that the cross sections calculated using the two-step model
and the above inputs for the final state interaction
reproduce most of the features of the experimental data reasonably well.
A theoretical effort to understand the Uppsala data
{{cite:71d596c6-5bf3-4f0d-8c40-4d64abdd890b}} was made earlier by Tengblad et. al. {{cite:ead932b8-d0bb-4201-b2d5-125cda9cd38e}}.
In {{cite:ead932b8-d0bb-4201-b2d5-125cda9cd38e}} the contribution of three different diagrams, namely, the
pick-up (a direct one-step mechanism of FORMULA  production), the impulse
approximation and the two-step mechanism (here the FORMULA  meson is produced in
two steps via the FORMULA  and
FORMULA  reactions) to the cross section for the
FORMULA  reaction is determined. The authors in
{{cite:ead932b8-d0bb-4201-b2d5-125cda9cd38e}} conclude that the impulse approximation is in general
negligible as compared to the other two diagrams,
the two-step mechanism is dominant in the near threshold region and the
contribution of the pick-up diagram (referred to as the direct mechanism in
the present work) increases with energy and matches the two-step contribution
at an excess energy of FORMULA  MeV. The latter conclusions regarding the
contributions of the two step and pick up diagrams are in contrast to the
findings of the present work as well as to existing literature on
similar kind of reactions. We note here that the authors in {{cite:ead932b8-d0bb-4201-b2d5-125cda9cd38e}}
do not include the final state interaction in their calculations in any way.
They treat the kinematics and the dependence of the pion propagator
(appearing in the two step model) on the Fermi
momenta in an approximate way. The FORMULA -matrices which enter as an
input to the two step model are simply extracted from experimental
cross sections and are hence not proper off-shell FORMULA -matrices.
As a result of the above approximations, the authors in {{cite:ead932b8-d0bb-4201-b2d5-125cda9cd38e}} do not
reproduce the observed enhancement in the FORMULA  invariant mass
distribution near threshold, and unlike the observed isotropic distributions,
find anisotropy in their calculated angular distributions.
The contribution from the direct mechanism (or the so-called pick-up diagram of
{{cite:ead932b8-d0bb-4201-b2d5-125cda9cd38e}}) to the total cross sections is found to be
about four orders of magnitude smaller than the two-step contribution
at threshold in the present work.
The one-step contribution does increase with energy
(as also found in {{cite:ead932b8-d0bb-4201-b2d5-125cda9cd38e}}), however, even at the highest energy
for which data is available (FORMULA  MeV) it remains two orders
of magnitude smaller than that due to the two-step model. This is in
contrast to the observations in {{cite:ead932b8-d0bb-4201-b2d5-125cda9cd38e}}, where the two processes give
comparable contributions at high energies.
The difference of orders of magnitude between the two processes can be
understood as a result of the large
momentum transfer, FORMULA , in the one-step process. This FORMULA , which
is very large in the threshold region (FORMULA  MeV/c) continues
to be large even at high energies. For example, it is FORMULA  MeV/c
even at the highest beam energy of 1096 MeV.
This finding of ours is very similar to the previous studies of the
reactions involving high momentum transfer.
For example, as mentioned above too, in {{cite:af7a2102-3dee-4ace-a673-ac3e3626c5b6}}, for the
FORMULA  reaction
up to 2.5 GeV beam energy, the authors
comment that the one-step cross
sections underestimate the data by more than two orders of magnitude. In yet
another calculation {{cite:5a0de7de-77bb-4478-b73c-af6b524831d5}} of the cross section for the
FORMULA He FORMULA  reaction (where FORMULA ) the two-step model was found to describe
the data on these reactions up to 3 GeV quite well.
In {{cite:bfc99d37-1d92-49a1-ab49-e15bd8a99656}}, in connection with the FORMULA  reaction,
the authors claim that for a beam energy of
1 - 3 GeV, the one-step mechanism predicts 2 to 3 orders of magnitude smaller
cross sections as compared to the two-step mechanism. The cross sections
obtained from the one-step model, in Ref. {{cite:ead932b8-d0bb-4201-b2d5-125cda9cd38e}} are, however, reported
to be only one order of magnitude less than those due to the two-step model
at threshold and comparable to the two-step ones at high energies.
In the next section, we describe the details of the formalism.
In the subsequent sections we present and discuss the results and finally
the conclusions.

The Formalism
The differential cross section for the FORMULA 
reaction, in the center of mass, can be written as,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the total energy in the center of mass and FORMULA 
and FORMULA  are the proton momenta in the
initial and final states respectively. FORMULA  denotes the invariant
mass of the FORMULA  system and FORMULA  and FORMULA 
denote, in the FORMULA  center of mass, the FORMULA  momentum and its solid
angle, respectively. FORMULA  represents the solid angle of the
outgoing proton. Angular brackets around FORMULA  in Eq. (REF ) represent
the sum over the final and initial spins.
The FORMULA -matrix, which includes the interaction between the FORMULA  and
the deuteron is given by
FORMULA 
where the spin projections for the proton and
the deuteron in the
initial and final states have been labeled as FORMULA 
and FORMULA  respectively. FORMULA  is the
production operator.
The wave function of the interacting FORMULA  in the final state has been
represented as FORMULA .
In terms of the elastic FORMULA  scattering
FORMULA -matrix, FORMULA , it is written as
FORMULA 
The second term here represents the scattered wave. It has
two parts originating from the
principal-value and the delta-function part of the propagator in the
intermediate state. Physically they represent the off-shell and the on-shell
scattering between the FORMULA  and the deuteron. The on-shell part can be
shown to be roughly proportional to the FORMULA  momentum and hence
dominant at higher energies. The relative contribution of these terms in
our case would be determined after we
substitute the above expression for FORMULA 
in Eq. (REF ).
We then get
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
It can be seen that the FORMULA  here appears as a half-off-shell
FORMULA -matrix.
FIGURE 
The production mechanism
For evaluating the FORMULA  production FORMULA -matrix,
FORMULA , we assume a two-step
mechanism as shown in Fig. 1. In this model, the incident proton produces
a pion in the first step on interacting with one of the nucleons of the
target deuteron. In the second step this pion produces an FORMULA  meson on
interacting with the other nucleon. Both these nucleons are off-shell and
have a momentum distribution given by the deuteron bound state wave function.
To write the production matrix, we resort to certain standard approximations
used in literature {{cite:6626b223-bbce-41ab-b4f3-5384f188a312}}
(in particular for the triangle diagram appearing in
Fig. 1). The amplitude for the FORMULA  process, which in principal is off-shell, is taken at an on-shell
energy. Considering the high proton beam energy, off-shell effects are not
expected to be significant. The FORMULA  process
is included via an off-shell FORMULA -matrix.
The production matrix is written as {{cite:af7a2102-3dee-4ace-a673-ac3e3626c5b6}}, {{cite:3e31d146-5a3b-4448-9d7b-1d204bbec948}},
FORMULA 
where, the squared four momentum of the intermediate pion,
FORMULA , with the energy,
FORMULA , calculated at zero fermi momentum and
FORMULA .
The summation is over internal spin projections
and the matrix element FORMULA 
represents the deuteron wave function in momentum space, which has been
written using the Paris parametrization {{cite:3daef122-b14a-4ee6-bdfd-881dcbc81d1f}}. The factor FORMULA 
is a result of summing the diagrams with an intermediate FORMULA  and FORMULA .
The integral over the pion momentum in above includes the contribution from
the pole as well as the principal value term. For the pion
propagator itself, as we see, we have taken the plane wave propagator. This
thus excludes any effect in our results due to medium modification of this
propagator due to other nucleons. This aspect may be worth investigating
in future.
The FORMULA -matrix for the intermediate FORMULA  process has
been taken from an energy dependent partial wave analysis of the FORMULA  reaction from threshold to 500 MeV {{cite:f632d2ba-297b-49d3-b466-3b83719dc89c}}. The
various observables in {{cite:f632d2ba-297b-49d3-b466-3b83719dc89c}} are given in terms of amplitudes which
are parametrized to fit the existing database. We refer the reader
to {{cite:f632d2ba-297b-49d3-b466-3b83719dc89c}} and the references therein for the relevant expressions
of the helicity and partial wave amplitudes and the notation
followed by the authors in {{cite:f632d2ba-297b-49d3-b466-3b83719dc89c}}.
For the FORMULA  sub-process,
different forms of FORMULA -matrices are available. We use the FORMULA -matrix from
{{cite:998bac82-00e0-4c87-9105-0c34a7702298}} which treats the FORMULA , and FORMULA  channels
in a coupled channel formalism. This FORMULA -matrix consists of
the meson - NFORMULA  vertices and the NFORMULA  propagator as given below:
FORMULA 
with,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  (FORMULA ) are the self energies
from the FORMULA  and FORMULA  loops. The parameters of this model are,
FORMULA  = 0.616, FORMULA  = 2.36 fmFORMULA  and FORMULA  = 1608.1 MeV.
This FORMULA -matrix reproduces the data on the
FORMULA  reaction very well.
FIGURE 
Although the contribution of the direct mechanism (Fig. 2)
is known to be small (owing to the large momentum transfer
involved in the process) {{cite:af7a2102-3dee-4ace-a673-ac3e3626c5b6}}, {{cite:5a0de7de-77bb-4478-b73c-af6b524831d5}}, {{cite:bfc99d37-1d92-49a1-ab49-e15bd8a99656}},
for completeness, we calculate its contribution to the total
cross section.
The FORMULA -matrix for this mechanism can be written as
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  represents the deuteron wave function in the initial state.
The spin summed FORMULA 
is given in terms of the total cross section for the FORMULA  reaction by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the initial and final momenta c.m.
system. The momentum transfer FORMULA , as shown in Fig. 2, is defined as,
FORMULA 
The total cross section, FORMULA , for FORMULA  reaction
is taken from the experiments {{cite:8d52cbb9-a7c5-476d-8282-ae57d930397c}}.

Final state interaction
FORMULA  interaction
This is incorporated through a half-off-shell FORMULA  FORMULA -matrix.
We construct this FORMULA -matrix using the following two prescriptions:

Factorized form of  FORMULA
In one ansatz we obtain it by multiplying the on-shell FORMULA 
FORMULA -matrix by an off-shell extrapolation factor FORMULA .
Requiring that this FORMULA -matrix goes to its on-shell value in the case
of on-shell momenta, we write
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  as FORMULA . For a half-off-shell
case, this obviously is the ratio of the half-off-shell to the on-shell
scattering amplitude.
For the on-shell FORMULA  FORMULA -matrix we use the effective range expansion
of the scattering amplitude up to the fourth power in momentum,
FORMULA 
where F is related to T by
FORMULA 
The effective range expansion parameters (A,R,S) are taken from a recent
relativistic Faddeev equation (RFE) calculation of {{cite:6f35e00d-adb8-4e25-a697-8f1c37ac7fe5}}.
This calculation uses the relativistic version of the Faddeev equations
for a three particle FORMULA  system, where m is a meson and it can be an
FORMULA  or a FORMULA  meson.
These particles interact pairwise, and these interactions are represented
with separable potentials. The parameters of the
FORMULA  potentials are fitted to the FORMULA  resonant
amplitude and the FORMULA  cross sections.
The FORMULA  effective range parameters obtained from these calculations
are listed in {{cite:6f35e00d-adb8-4e25-a697-8f1c37ac7fe5}} for different sets of the meson-nucleon potentials.
Each of these sets gives a specific value of the FORMULA  scattering length,
which is also listed in {{cite:6f35e00d-adb8-4e25-a697-8f1c37ac7fe5}}.
Since the half-off-shell extrapolation factor FORMULA 
is not known with any certainty, we choose the following two forms for it.
(i) Following the method in {{cite:c7e5a436-f01e-4270-bec4-04536701f7a7}} for the
final state interaction in the FORMULA  system, we express the off-shell
form factor in terms of the deuteron form factor,
FORMULA 
where for the deuteron wave function, FORMULA , we take the Paris
parametrization.
(ii) As a second choice, the form factor is taken to be the ratio of the
off-shell FORMULA  FORMULA -matrix to its on-shell value, where both of them are
calculated using the three body equations within FRA. The input to
these calculations is the elementary FORMULA  scattering matrix,
the details of which are given in the next Section.

Few body equations within the finite rank approximation
The other prescription of FORMULA  FSI involves the use of the half-off-shell
FORMULA  FORMULA -matrix obtained by solving few body equations within the finite
rank approximation (FRA). For the details of this formalism and the
expression for the FORMULA -nucleus FORMULA -matrix, we refer the reader to our
earlier works {{cite:3e31d146-5a3b-4448-9d7b-1d204bbec948}}. To mention briefly, the FRA involves restricting
the spectral decomposition of
the nuclear Hamiltonian in the intermediate state to the ground state,
neglecting thereby all excited and break-up channels of the nucleus.
This is justified in the FORMULA He and possibly in the
FORMULA He case, but in FORMULA deuteron collisions,
where the break-up energy is just 2.225 MeV, the
applicability of the FRA may be limited. However, it should be noted that
a comparative study {{cite:ada8f487-72b8-40c1-8371-9a0b0dd95c59}} of the FORMULA  scattering lengths
calculated using the FRA and the exact Alt-Grassberger-Sandhas
(AGS) {{cite:22fac4ad-c3a7-4358-bb68-7df9ec0290a5}} equations (which include these intermediate excitations)
shows that they are not very different if the real part of the
FORMULA  scattering length is restricted up to about 0.5 fm.


FORMULA  interaction
We incorporate the FORMULA  FSI in our calculations
by multiplying our model FORMULA -matrix by the inverse Jost function,
FORMULA . We include the FSI in both the 1/2 and 3/2 spin states
of FORMULA  and restrict it to the s-wave.
Since the FORMULA  and FORMULA  are charged we
also include the Coulomb effects. Following standard
procedure, we write the Jost function in terms of phase shifts and
use the effective range expansion for the later.
The complete expression for the s-wave inverse Jost function squared
is written as,
FORMULA 
Here, to include the effect of the existence of one bound state, namely,
the spin 1/2 state (FORMULA ), the doublet Jost function is multiplied by a
factor FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the separation energy
of FORMULA  into FORMULA . Its value is taken to be 5.48 MeV.
The expressions for spin quadruplet
(Q) and doublet (D) FORMULA  are given by
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
where,
FORMULA 
and FORMULA  and FORMULA  are defined as
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  stands for either Q or D.
The factor FORMULA  in above has its origin in the Coulomb interaction.
The phase shifts FORMULA  are obtained from an effective-range
expansion {{cite:43c5dab1-65c0-42c6-8ab7-70d78c3c0c63}}, {{cite:21c17d19-41f5-493b-ac26-dfb7bdf39765}},
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
Here FORMULA  is the reduced mass in the FORMULA  system, FORMULA  the
Coulomb parameter and FORMULA  is the usual
electromagnetic coupling constant. The values of the expansion
coefficients FORMULA , FORMULA  in Eq. (REF ) are taken as
FORMULA  = 11.88 fm, FORMULA  = 2.63 fm, FORMULA  = 2.73 fm, and FORMULA  = 2.27 fm.
They have been determined from a fit to the FORMULA  elastic-scattering
phase shifts in the relative FORMULA  momentum range up to around 200 MeV/c
{{cite:42e1e572-454d-4530-a2d9-b4ec114cf2b5}}.
The above expression for the Jost function has the required property that
for large FORMULA , FORMULA .

Results and Discussion
Before we discuss the results of the present work, in order to highlight
the FSI effects in the experimental FORMULA  invariant mass distribution
we remove the phase space from the experimental FORMULA  and
plot in Fig. 3 the FORMULA , which is then given by,
FORMULA 
where,
FORMULA 
as a function of the excess energy, FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the invariant mass of the FORMULA  system.
In this figure we also show the plane wave result (i.e. FORMULA  does not include any FSI). The cross section,
FORMULA  in Eq. (REF ), is evaluated for each
FORMULA  by performing an integral over the FORMULA  centre of mass
momenta, FORMULA . The range of the allowed values of FORMULA  at
each FORMULA  is shown by the hashed region. One clearly sees a
large enhancement in the experimental FORMULA  near small values of
FORMULA , which, most likely is due to the FORMULA  FSI.
We also observe a rise at large
values of FORMULA . Examining the range of FORMULA  relative momenta which
contribute to FORMULA  at each FORMULA , one can see that this rise occurs
at small values of FORMULA , indicating thereby the possibility of a large
effect of FORMULA  FSI in this region.
FIGURE 
In Fig. 4, we show two sets of the calculated FORMULA  along with the
experimental results for a beam energy of 1032 MeV. These results include
only FORMULA  FSI. We limit the range of FORMULA  up to about 10 MeV,
where, this effect is large. In Fig. 4(a) we show results for the factorized
prescription with the off-shell factor generated from the deuteron form
factor and the on-shell part arising from the relativistic Faddeev
equation (RFE) calculation of {{cite:6f35e00d-adb8-4e25-a697-8f1c37ac7fe5}}. The results are shown for
three different sets of interaction parameters in the RFE.
Since these sets give uniquely different values of the FORMULA  scattering
lengths FORMULA , we identify them by their corresponding
FORMULA  values. For the results presented here, these values are
0.42 + i0.34 fm, 0.75 + i0.27 fm and 1.07 + i0.26 fm. We see that
our results reproduce the enhancement seen in the experimental FORMULA 
at small values of FORMULA . The absolute magnitude depends upon the
choice of the RFE parameters. It increases with FORMULA , which
designate these parameter sets. The set corresponding to
FORMULA  fm, gives results closest to the experimental
values.
FIGURE 
In Fig. 4(b) we show FORMULA  calculated using few body equations within
the FRA, for FORMULA  FSI. These results are shown for
three different inputs of the FORMULA  FORMULA -matrix taken from {{cite:d6c7445a-a04f-4df6-9347-e00f3414747f}}.
The choice of these FORMULA -matrices is such that their scattering
length values are close to those used in Fig. 4(a). Though this model has
the limitation of retaining the intermediate
nucleus in its ground state in the FORMULA  nucleus elastic scattering,
the off-shell re-scattering effects have been properly included. If we
compare Fig. 4(a) and 4(b), the two sets of results are similar.
FIGURE 
In order to check the sensitivity of the results to the off-shell form factor
used in the factorized FORMULA  FORMULA -matrix,
in Fig. 5(a), we show the FORMULA  calculated using two different off-shell
form factors. The on-shell FORMULA  is obtained from RFE and the
off-shell part is
either treated with a deuteron form factor (solid line) or a few body FRA
form factor (dash dotted line) as explained in section II B.
The elementary FORMULA  FORMULA -matrix parameters required for the calculation
of the FRA form factor are taken from the
parametrization of Green and Wycech {{cite:d6c7445a-a04f-4df6-9347-e00f3414747f}}. Even though the results
(as shown in Fig. 4(a)) corresponding to the aFORMULA  = 1.07 + i0.26 fm
seem to be the closest to the data, to compare the effect of using different
off-shell form factor, we choose the results corresponding to
aFORMULA  = 0.75 + i0.27 fm. We make this choice such that we can compare
the two calculations for the inputs corresponding to a similar FORMULA 
scattering length. It should be expected then, that the off-shell form factors
obtained from two different methods should not differ much.
This is seen explicitly in Fig. 5(b) where the two form factors are shown
as a function of off-shell momentum (FORMULA ) for an on-shell value, FORMULA 
near the low energy peak in the
FORMULA  invariant mass distribution (to be discussed in Fig. 9 later).
Next, we include in our calculations the effect of the FORMULA  FSI. This is
done by multiplying the FORMULA  squared FORMULA -matrix
(Eq. (REF )) used above by the inverse Jost function squared in
Eq. (REF ) and Eq. (REF ), and integrating it over the allowed
range (as shown in Fig. 3) of FORMULA  momenta, FORMULA  for each FORMULA .
We show these results in Fig. 6 for the RFE (with deuteron form factor)
model of FORMULA  FSI, for the parameter set corresponding to
aFORMULA  = 1.07 + i0.26 fm. We find, that the FORMULA  FSI affects the
results in the whole region of FORMULA , while the effect of FORMULA 
FSI is confined to small value of FORMULA . The large effect of FORMULA 
FSI in the region of small FORMULA , however, may not be taken with
confidence as the value of FORMULA  in this region is large (as shown in
Fig. 3), where the s-wave effective range expansion (Eq. (REF )) for
the calculation of Jost function might not be sufficient. In any case,
it appears that the effects of both the FORMULA  and the FORMULA  FSI on the
FORMULA  invariant mass distribution are significant. If we disregard the
calculated FORMULA  effect for small FORMULA , the FORMULA  and FORMULA  FSI
dominate in regions well separated from each other.
FIGURE 
FIGURE 
Apart from the FSI, another important ingredient of our calculations is
the two-step
description of the production vertex. Because of the large momentum
transfer, we believe, as has also been stressed in Ref. {{cite:ead932b8-d0bb-4201-b2d5-125cda9cd38e}}, that
the angular distribution of the outgoing particles is
probably more sensitive to the description of the production vertex.
Inclusive angular distributions have been
measured for all the three outgoing particles in the
FORMULA  reaction. In Fig. 7, we show the
calculated angular distributions for all the
three outgoing particles along with the measured distributions.
We show results without any FSI, with FORMULA  FSI and with FORMULA  and
FORMULA  FSI both included.
As each angle has contribution from a range of FORMULA  as well as
FORMULA , the calculated results include integration of the cross section
over these variables.
We find that the observed nearly isotropic nature of the experimental
angular distributions for the proton, deuteron and eta already gets
reproduced by the plane wave calculations. The effect of both
FORMULA  and FORMULA  FSI is large and persists over all the angles. Their
inclusion brings the magnitudes of the proton and deuteron angular
distributions near to experiments. The magnitude of the eta distribution,
however, does not seem to be affected much with the FSI.
FIGURE 
Experimental data also exist on the total cross section. In Fig. 8,
we compare the total cross sections calculated including both
the FORMULA  and FORMULA  FSI with the measured
cross sections. The results are shown with the factorized form of FORMULA  FSI
with deuteron form factor for the set corresponding to FORMULA  scattering
length equal to
FORMULA  fm. As we see, the calculated cross sections are
in good agreement with the experimental data.
In Fig. 8 we also give the cross sections calculated for
the one-step direct mechanism (Fig. 2) mentioned in the previous
section. Near threshold, these cross sections are about four
orders of magnitude below those obtained from the
two-step model and two orders of magnitude smaller in the high energy range.
As mentioned in the Introduction,
this observation is similar to that in other works involving
large momentum transfer reactions {{cite:af7a2102-3dee-4ace-a673-ac3e3626c5b6}}, {{cite:5a0de7de-77bb-4478-b73c-af6b524831d5}}, {{cite:bfc99d37-1d92-49a1-ab49-e15bd8a99656}}, and is
understandable because the momentum
transfer continues to be large (FORMULA  MeV/c) in the FORMULA  reaction even at an excess energy as large as 100 MeV.
FIGURE 
Now we make an observation about the importance of off-shell scattering
in treating FORMULA  FSI near threshold. The scattering part of the FORMULA 
wave function (Eq. (REF )), gets contributions from the off-shell as
well as the on-shell scattering in the nucleus. To see quantitatively
the relative importance of these two contributions to the cross section for
the FORMULA  reaction, in Fig. 9 we show their
contributions separately in the FORMULA  invariant mass distribution.
These results include only the FORMULA  FSI generated from the factorized
prescription using RFE and the deuteron form factor for the FORMULA 
FORMULA -matrix. We find that near threshold the off-shell scattering completely
dominates the threshold enhancement. At higher excess energy, as expected,
the on-shell contribution takes over.
FIGURE 
Finally we show the nature of agreement of our calculated results with the
invariant FORMULA  mass distribution. In Fig. 10, we compare the calculated
results including both the FORMULA  and FORMULA  FSI with the experimental
results. The results are for aFORMULA  = 1.07 + i0.26 fm calculated with
the factorized prescription using RFE and the off-shell factor generated from
the deuteron form factor. As we see the overall agreement is reasonably good.

Summary
The invariant FORMULA  mass distribution in the FORMULA  reaction has been studied
by describing the production mechanism in terms of
a two step model with a pion
being produced in the intermediate state.
The FORMULA  final state interaction (FSI) has been included in (a) a
factorized form involving an on-shell FORMULA  and two types of
off-shell form factors and (b) by solving few body equations within the FRA.
The FORMULA  FSI is included through a Jost function.
The conclusions of this investigation can be summarized as:

Experimentally observed large enhancement in the cross section
near small FORMULA  excess energy, FORMULA  is reproduced by the
FORMULA  FSI. The rise in the cross section at large FORMULA 
(which corresponds to a range of small momenta, FORMULA ) can be
accounted for by the FORMULA  FSI.

Quantitative reproduction of the large enhancement requires FORMULA 
FSI corresponding to large values of FORMULA . In the present
calculation it is around 1.07 + i0.26 fm.

The calculations successfully reproduce the observed
isotropic angular distribution of the proton and the
deuteron in the final state. The total cross sections for the
FORMULA  reaction are also well reproduced.

The off-shell part of the FORMULA  scattering dominates near threshold.

The results for two different choices of the off-shell extrapolation
factor in the factorized form of the FORMULA  FSI are similar.
