Band structure of metallic sodium cobaltate NaFORMULA CoOFORMULA  (FORMULA =0.33, 0.48, 0.61 0.72) has been investigated by local density approximation+Hubbard FORMULA  (LDA+FORMULA ) method and within Gutzwiller approximation for the Co-FORMULA  manifold. Correlation effects being taken into account results in suppression of the FORMULA  hole pockets at the Fermi surface in agreement with recent
angle-resolved photo-emission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments. In the Gutzwiller approximation the bilayer splitting is significantly reduced due to the correlation effects. The formation of high spin (HS) state in Co FORMULA -shell was shown to be very improbable.

1. Introduction. Puzzling properties of sodium cobaltate NaFORMULA CoOFORMULA 
are the topic of many recent theoretical and experimental investigations  {{cite:b244cafd-4dc1-416e-8945-b97062611270}}. This material holds much promise for thermoelectronics due to its large thermopower {{cite:ce7f9593-3efc-4990-81b6-b929c9ceddce}} together with the relatively low
resistivity {{cite:69797b1e-88c8-471b-8d36-7ebd31f17c0c}}. The discovery of superconductivity with TFORMULA 
about 5K in NaFORMULA CoO FORMULAFORMULA HFORMULA O {{cite:69797b1e-88c8-471b-8d36-7ebd31f17c0c}} revived the
interest in lamellar sodium cobaltates. Moreover, the charge and magnetic long
range orders on the frustrated triangular lattice of cobaltate is of the
fundamental interest. The band theory predict the complicated Fermi surface
(FS) with one large hole pocket around the FORMULA  point and six small
pockets near the FORMULA  points of the hexagonal
Brillouin zone at least for FORMULA  {{cite:736a1e39-bde4-4d51-a465-81ccc56b86a3}}, {{cite:d4fea31b-a449-4477-b82f-9965ae6909d8}}. However,
intensive investigations by several ARPES groups reveal absence of six small
pockets in both NaFORMULA CoO FORMULAFORMULA HFORMULA O and in its parent compound
NaFORMULA CoOFORMULA  {{cite:e28a861c-ba31-42ca-a818-bbd7b6549206}}, {{cite:ce0bc41a-c609-4c10-8d07-14e22c0a1b31}}, {{cite:c03f3914-9a6c-4b72-9895-a58dd3049696}}, {{cite:f1db4e96-c0a8-48bf-8b8b-1ffef5cbe3b7}}, {{cite:fadec067-0636-459c-9982-c8aaa490670c}}.
The disagreement between ARPES spectra and ab-initio calculated band
structure points to the importance of the electronic correlations in these
oxides. Other evidences for the correlated behavior come from the data on an
anomalous Hall effect and a drop of the thermopower in holistic magnetic
field {{cite:bb29e930-f59a-49f3-a5f9-5de549b83712}}.
The six hole pockets are absent in the L(S)DA+FORMULA 
calculations {{cite:d43f7f0f-17c9-4e47-aec0-b927533eb70f}}, {{cite:08796ced-b852-48ea-bf2e-fc79335dbc7c}}. However, in this approach, the insulating
gap is formed by a splitting of the local single-electron states due to
spin-polarization, resulting in a spin polarized Fermi surface with an area
twice as large as that observed through ARPES. Moreover, the long range
ferromagnetic order has been set by hand because of limitation of LDA+FORMULA . The
predicted large local magnetic moments as well as the splitting of bands can be
considered as artifacts of the L(S)DA+FORMULA  method.
Although LDA+FORMULA  method is usually applied to describe insulators {{cite:341ddc81-f78f-4a65-b50a-2b3dd5e5f6ce}}, there are some achievement in investigation of metals and metallic
compounds {{cite:ff36a116-4753-47f9-8c9a-27137c7b0dbf}}, {{cite:a3e97749-6840-4dcb-8c97-3ffd18602eb2}}. To analyze the effect of electronic
correlations on the Fermi surface formation in sodium cobaltate we employ
non-magnetic LDA+FORMULA  method. Then, we use a Gutzwiller approximation to display the effect of correlations on the bilayer splitting and compare it with LDA+FORMULA  results.
Co FORMULA -level splits by crystal field of oxygen octahedron in lower FORMULA  and higher FORMULA  bands. The deficiency of Na in NaFORMULA CoOFORMULA  introduces additional
holes in the system. Cobalt, having FORMULA  configuration and filled FORMULA 
shell in parent NaCoOFORMULA , is nonmagnetic. But in nonstoichiometric compound
part of Co ions become magnetic with local moment about 1FORMULA . This value is provided by FORMULA  configuration and one hole in FORMULA  shell. However, the
experiments revealed the magnetic susceptibility at room temperature that is
much higher than it was expected for dilute magnetic impurity in non-magnetic
solvent. Explanation of this anomaly was suggested in Ref. {{cite:65d6ed2b-cbb7-4f39-8e98-1b422739b255}} as
transition from low-spin (LS) state with six FORMULA -electrons on FORMULA  shell to high-spin (HS) state with five FORMULA -electrons on FORMULA  shell and one electron on FORMULA . The possibility of such transition will be discussed below.
2. LDA+FORMULA  results. NaFORMULA CoOFORMULA  crystallize in the hexagonal
unit cell (FORMULA  space group) with FORMULA =2.83176(3)Å  and FORMULA =10.8431(2)Å  at 12K Ref. {{cite:85a437cd-cfce-4a08-b57a-81de564f6ba8}}. Displacement of Na atoms
from their ideal sites FORMULA  FORMULA  on about 0.2Å  are observed in
non-stoichiometric cobaltates for both room and low temperatures. This is
probably due to the repulsion of a randomly distributed Na atoms, locally
violating hexagonal symmetry {{cite:85a437cd-cfce-4a08-b57a-81de564f6ba8}}. In the present investigation
Na atoms are shifted back to their 2d ideal sites. In order to avoid charge
disproportionately which can arises from some Na distribution if the supercell
is used in calculation, the change in the Na concentration has been considered
in virtual crystal approximation (VCA) where each 2d site is occupied by virtual atoms with fractional number of valence electrons FORMULA  and a core charge FORMULA  instead of Na. Note, that all core states of virtual atom are left unchanged and corresponds to Na ones. We have chosen FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA  states of cobalt, FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA  states of oxygen, and FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA  states of Na as the valence states for TB-LMTO-ASA computation scheme. The radii of atomic spheres where 1.99 a.u. for Co, 1.61 a.u. for oxygen, and 2.68 a.u. for Na. Two classes of empty spheres (pseudo-atoms without core states) were added to fill the unit cell volume.
Crystal field of oxygen octahedron splits Co FORMULA -band into doubly degenerate
FORMULA  and triply degenerate FORMULA  subbands (without taking spin into account). LDA calculations shows that those manifolds are separated by about 2
eV {{cite:736a1e39-bde4-4d51-a465-81ccc56b86a3}}. Here partially filled FORMULA  subband crosses the Fermi
level whereas FORMULA  subband due to strongly hybridization with nearest oxygen
atoms is positioned well above the Fermi level. The procedure proposed in
Ref. {{cite:a48f163f-a1a7-4151-80e9-43ad6582c4c2}} allows one to calculate the Coulomb repulsion parameter FORMULA  taking into account the screening of localized FORMULA -shell by itinerant FORMULA - and FORMULA -electrons. Resulting FORMULA  is equal to 6.7 eV. However, the presence of the FORMULA –FORMULA  splitting give the reason to take into account an additional screening channel provided by the less localized FORMULA  electrons. The value of FORMULA =2.67 eV for FORMULA  orbitals was calculated using the “constrained LDA” method {{cite:1f88fb58-562c-49f0-96a2-fead935b34fe}}, where the screening by the FORMULA  electrons is also taken into account. This value was used in the
present calculation for all doping concentrations FORMULA . Hund's exchange
parameter FORMULA  depends weakly on screening effects due to its “on-site”
character. Its value was also calculated within the “constrained LDA” method and was found to be 1.07 eV.
First, we have verified the possibility of HS state formation on Co FORMULA -shell.
For this purpose the unit cell of NaFORMULA CoOFORMULA  with two Co atoms was
considered. We have started from a saturated A-type antiferromagnetic
configuration with five electrons on the FORMULA  and one on the FORMULA  shells.
Small FORMULA =2.67 eV does not stabilize such magnetic configuration and LS state
was obtained. Increasing FORMULA  up to 5 eV however results in HS state with large
local magnetic moment about 1.96 FORMULA . Nevertheless, this HS state has the
total energy about 1.75 eV higher then the energy of a LS state. This large
difference in total energy of both considered spin states arises form the hexagonal structure of cobaltates where the angle of Co-O-Co bond is close to 90FORMULA  in contrast to almost 180FORMULA  in, e.g., RCoOFORMULA  (R=La, Ho). In the latter case the FORMULA  band has the width of about 3-5 eV and its bottom lies just above the Fermi level. The system wins energy of 2FORMULA  forming a HS state overcoming the gap energy which is less than 1 eV. Due to this fact the difference between the LS and intermediate spin states in RCoOFORMULA  is less then 250 meV {{cite:c2355059-72ae-4476-be3c-141abc87fdfa}}. The angle of Co-O-Co bond is close to 90FORMULA  in
cobaltates and it results in a weak overlap between FORMULA  orbitals and hence in a narrow FORMULA  band with larger gap between it and the FORMULA  band. Our
calculation confirms that formation of the HS state in NaFORMULA CoOFORMULA  is rather improbable and cannot be stabilized by any distortion of crystal structure or
clusterization proposed in Ref. {{cite:65d6ed2b-cbb7-4f39-8e98-1b422739b255}}. Local magnetic moments on Co sites can arise only because of the doped holes due to Na atoms deficiency. Those holes order on Co atoms and form nonmagnetic CoFORMULA  and magnetic CoFORMULA  ions with FORMULA  and FORMULA  configurations, respectively. In the following, we consider only the LS state.
The ordering of holes on FORMULA  shell and corresponding long-range magnetic
and charge orders in NaFORMULA CoOFORMULA  arise probably due to specific
arrangement of Na atoms. These arrangements were observed
experimentally {{cite:f4de23e1-9224-46dc-9b03-c038e23a5799}} for several doping concentrations including
FORMULA . Proper description of such order within the “unrestricted Hartree-Fock” gives strong spin and orbital polarization and local magnetic moment of about 1FORMULA  on CoFORMULA  sites as well as the insulating ground state with a sizable gap. To describe the non-ordered systems, the implementation of the “restricted Hartree-Fock” method is more suitable. In the latter, starting from the non-magnetic configuration of the FORMULA -shell with the equal number of spin-up and spin-down electrons, LDA+FORMULA  method gives the non-magnetic solution without spin or orbital polarization. Note, that the gap does not open and NaFORMULA CoOFORMULA  remains metallic for all Na concentration.
Obtained band structure of NaFORMULA CoOFORMULA  for FORMULA =0.33, 0.48, 0.61, and 0.72 are shown in Fig. REF . Dashed (black) lines correspond to LDA results whereas solid (red) lines are the bands obtained by LDA+FORMULA  method. Cobalt FORMULA  and oxygen
FORMULA  states are separated by a small gap of about -1.25 eV for FORMULA  and
FORMULA . However, this gap disappears for lower doping concentration since the FORMULA  band goes down when the number of FORMULA  electrons decreases. The presence of
the two CoOFORMULA  layers within the unit cell due to alternation of the oxygen
arrangement results in a bonding-antibonding (bilayer) splitting, also present
in Fig. REF .
FIGURE 
The degeneracy of the FORMULA  levels is partially lifted by the trigonal
crystal field distortion which splits them into the higher lying FORMULA  singlet and the two lower lying FORMULA  states. However, slight difference in
occupation numbers of FORMULA  and FORMULA  orbitals (0.714 and 0.886
respectively for FORMULA ) results in a significant difference between the LDA+FORMULA  and LDA band structures. The energy of the less occupied FORMULA 
orbital increases for both spins, whereas all FORMULA  bands go down (the total
FORMULA –FORMULA  splitting becomes 0.21 eV for FORMULA ). This makes six FORMULA  Fermi surface hole pockets to disappear for small FORMULA  values. Note that for all Na concentration LDA+FORMULA  predicts large FORMULA  Fermi pocket centered
around the FORMULA  point in excellent agreement with the ARPES spectra for
FORMULA . The additional electron pocket close to the FORMULA  point appears in
both LDA and LDA+FORMULA  methods for a large doping concentrations. It was
discussed in our previous work {{cite:4c48b148-a019-428e-a770-d46a1afd78ae}}, {{cite:fdf2641a-c1a8-4735-87f7-0ecfa6e3cdda}} in connection
with the electronic theory for the itinerant magnetism of highly doped compounds.
2. Gutzwiller approximation. For the small doping concentrations, FORMULA , sodium cobaltate displays a canonical Fermi-liquid behavior both
in resistivity {{cite:16237c7c-7d8e-4a7f-8378-1bd0e97fc3e8}} and in NMR relaxation rate {{cite:c1863aa8-9d58-4b62-9fef-f42eb49a31f7}}.
Transport measurements {{cite:0e24ebf0-b45d-4d94-a3b3-0f74b10faef6}} on single crystals with FORMULA  also
revealed Fermi-liquid behavior at low temperatures. However, this behavior is
characterized by the enormous electron-electron scattering. The Gutzwiller
approximation {{cite:9daf34f0-9428-4c89-bef1-efe81529e383}}, {{cite:55c72269-92d5-40f1-a6c6-4b5ee161078f}}, {{cite:4d87ab9e-78e4-48cb-85d0-f628fcf924e2}} for the Hubbard model recommended itself as a good tool to describe low-energy quantities such as the FS and a ground state energy in the correlated metallic system. We will use the multiband generalization of this approximation {{cite:520fab74-3853-4159-818d-84da477851af}} to
investigate the effect of correlations on the bilayer splitting and compare it
with the LDA+FORMULA  results.
Hamiltonian for CoOFORMULA -plane in a hole representation is given by:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  (FORMULA ) is the
annihilation (creation) operator for the FORMULA  hole at Co site FORMULA ,
spin FORMULA  and orbital index FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA  is the hopping matrix element between two lattice sites
connected by the spatial vector FORMULA , FORMULA  is
the single-electron energies in which the chemical potential FORMULA  is included. Since LDA-calculated hoppings and single-electron energies do not depend much
on doping concentration {{cite:4c48b148-a019-428e-a770-d46a1afd78ae}}, {{cite:fdf2641a-c1a8-4735-87f7-0ecfa6e3cdda}}, we use here parameters
for NaFORMULA CoOFORMULA  form Table I of Ref. {{cite:fdf2641a-c1a8-4735-87f7-0ecfa6e3cdda}}. To take the bilayer splitting into account, we also consider hoppings FORMULA  between the adjacent CoOFORMULA  planes. Their values (in eV) were also derived from LDA
results and are equal to FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA .
Within the Gutzwiller approximation the Hamiltonian describing the interacting
system far from the metal-insulator transition for FORMULA ,
FORMULA , is replaced by the effective non-interacting Hamiltonian:
FORMULA 
Here, FORMULA  is the renormalized
hopping, FORMULA , FORMULA  is the orbital's filling
factors, FORMULA  is the
equation for the chemical potential. FORMULA  are the Lagrange multipliers yielding the correlation induced shifts of the
single-electron energies. They are determined by minimizing the energy
FORMULA  with respect to the orbital filling factors FORMULA . It is this energy shift FORMULA , that
forces the FORMULA  bands to sink below the Fermi level {{cite:a423c92c-81f6-44e2-b177-546997e8a263}}. This is
clearly seen in the doping-dependent evolution of the quasiparticle dispersion
within the Gutzwiller approximation in Fig. REF . To obtain these figures we self-consistently solved equations on FORMULA  and on the chemical potential FORMULA .
The comparison of the Gutzwiller approximation results with the LDA+FORMULA 
dispersion reveals few very interesting conclusions. First, both approximations result in a suppression of FORMULA  hole pockets of the FS. Second, the bilayer
splitting is strongly doping dependent and significantly reduced for the Gutzwiller quasiparticles in comparison with the LDA+FORMULA  quasiparticles because the renormalization coefficient, FORMULA , occurs not only for the in-plane hoppings, but also for the
interlayer hoppings FORMULA . Third, when both bonding and
antibonding FORMULA  bands do not cross the Fermi level around the FORMULA 
point, the FS crossings are the same in both approximations (see Fig. REF a). It is a simple consequence of the Luttinger theorem which holds for both approaches. But for large FORMULA  due to the larger bilayer splitting in the LDA+FORMULA  approach, the Fermi surfaces become different, while the Luttinger theorem is again preserved. With increase of the doping concentration FORMULA , the bandwidth of the Gutzwiller quasiparticles becomes closer to the LDA+FORMULA  because the band renormalization factor FORMULA  comes closer to unity.
FIGURE 
Now we will discuss the correlations between our results and a more rigorous
theory, namely, the Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT). Generally, within DMFT
the band structure of a Hubbard model consist of three parts: two incoherent
Hubbard subbands and a coherent near-Fermi-level quasiparticle band. Since FORMULA 
is not very large in sodium cobaltates, Hubbard subbands loose their spectral
weight and are almost merged with the coherent band. Thus, low-energy
excitations are determined mostly by this quasiparticle band. And it is this
band that revealed within the Gutzwiller approximation, even if we formally in
the limit of FORMULA .
In the case of NaFORMULA CoOFORMULA , DMFT calculations show that for the small FORMULA  and a non-zero FORMULA , FORMULA  FS pockets can be stabilized
{{cite:bfa1dce2-cf2e-46cf-bcd2-297723c993c3}}, {{cite:d4ba5b5d-947b-4ba9-b92d-22838c32debf}}. On the other hand, more recent DMFT calculations of Ref. {{cite:395346fa-9457-48f7-9399-b66bea17547b}} confirms results of the Gutzwiller approximation
provided that the crystal field slitting FORMULA  is about 50 meV. This
value is in agreement with our value of FORMULA  meV {{cite:fdf2641a-c1a8-4735-87f7-0ecfa6e3cdda}}, so our results are consistent with DMFT.
2. Conclusion. In the present work employing ab-initio “constrained LDA” method we obtained Coulomb repulsion parameter FORMULA =2.67 eV
for FORMULA  orbitals taking into account the screening by the FORMULA -electrons in addition to the screening by the itinerant FORMULA - and FORMULA -electrons. Hund's exchnage parameter was found to be FORMULA =1.07 eV.
Also we have shown that due to the Co-O-Co bond angle being close to 90FORMULA  in NaFORMULA CoOFORMULA , the energy gap between the LS and HS states is too large to be overcome by the clusterization or reasonable distortions of the crystal structure. Thus we conclude that realization of the HS state is highly improbable in these particular substance.
To analyze the effect of electronic correlations on the Fermi surface
topology of NaFORMULA CoOFORMULA  we use two approaches, non-magnetic LDA+FORMULA  and
the Gutzwiller approximation for the Hubbard-type model based on the LDA band
structure. Physically, the reason of FORMULA  FS pockets disappearance is quite clear. Within LDA+FORMULA  the energy of the less occupied FORMULA  orbital
increases for both spins, whereas all FORMULA  bands go down. This makes six
FORMULA  FS hole pockets to disappear for small FORMULA  values, in agreement with
ARPES for FORMULA . Gutzwiller approximation also resulted in a suppression of
FORMULA  hole pockets at the FS. Most importantly, the bilayer splitting was
found to be strongly doping dependent and significantly reduced for the Gutzwiller quasiparticles in comparison with the LDA+FORMULA  quasiparticles. This may explain why the bilayer splitting is not observed in ARPES though it is very pronounced in the LDA band structure.
