Present expansion stage of the universe is believed to be mainly
governed by the cosmological constant, collisionless dark matter and
baryonic matter. The latter two components are often modeled as
zero-pressure fluids. In our previous work we have shown that to the
second-order cosmological perturbations, the relativistic equations
of the zero-pressure, irrotational, multi-component fluids in a
spatially near flat background effectively coincide with the
Newtonian equations. As the Newtonian equations only have quadratic
order nonlinearity, it is practically interesting to derive the
potential third-order perturbation terms in general relativistic
treatment which correspond to pure general relativistic corrections.
In our previous work we have shown that even in a single component
fluid there exists substantial amount of pure relativistic
third-order correction terms. We have, however, shown that those
correction terms are independent of the horizon scale, and are quite
small (FORMULA  smaller compared with the
relativistic/Newtonian second-order terms) due to the weak level
anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation. Here, we
present pure general relativistic correction terms appearing in the
third-order perturbations of the multi-component zero-pressure
fluids. As a result we show that, as in a single component
situation, the third-order correction terms are quite small (FORMULA  smaller) in the context of the evolution of our
universe. Still, there do exist pure general relativistic correction
terms in third-order perturbations which could potentially become
important in future development of precision cosmology. We include
the cosmological constant in all our analyses.

Introduction
Recently, we have been presenting a series of work based on our
theoretical study of relativistic nonlinear cosmological
perturbations {{cite:69303bc4-8df5-466a-a9bc-e8aef3369082}}, {{cite:a6bd7f84-4bca-470c-9869-6617db5bd463}}, {{cite:47b85dd3-646e-4132-89bd-a2353a948e72}}, {{cite:f28885fc-23c7-4532-bdab-3374f2d90169}}. We
have shown that to the second-order perturbations, general
relativistic equations of a zero-pressure, irrotational fluid in a
spatially flat background have exact Newtonian correspondence except
for the presence of the gravitational wave contributions
{{cite:69303bc4-8df5-466a-a9bc-e8aef3369082}}, {{cite:a6bd7f84-4bca-470c-9869-6617db5bd463}}. In an accompanying paper
{{cite:4cb25cc7-d422-45e5-a385-779ef0a4b838}} we have relaxed all the assumptions we
made in the second-order perturbations in {{cite:69303bc4-8df5-466a-a9bc-e8aef3369082}}, {{cite:a6bd7f84-4bca-470c-9869-6617db5bd463}},
and have derived pure general relativistic effects from the
pressures, rotation, spatial curvature, and multi-component. In that
work, we have shown that except for the multi-component situation,
relaxing any of the other three assumptions leads to pure general
relativistic correction terms appearing in the second order.
Pressures are intrinsically general relativistic even in the
background and the linear-order perturbations. The presence of
background curvature leads to first non-vanishing relativistic
correction terms appearing in the second order. The rotational
perturbations generally lead to relativistic correction terms which
become negligible in the small-scale (sub-horizon scale) limit, thus
having relativistic/Newtonian correspondence in that limit. In the
case of zero-pressure, irrotational multi-component fluids in a flat
background, effectively we have exact relativistic/Newtonian
correspondence even in the multi-component situation; this will be
summarized in the later section of this work.
The relativistic/Newtonian correspondence in the background world
model was known in the zero-pressure medium by the work of Friedmann
in 1922 {{cite:2b54dc7f-ef51-40ab-ad0c-63c50223770b}} in the context of Einstein's gravity,
and by the work of Milne and McCrea in 1934 {{cite:6c4a1d61-ca5c-4f9c-a4a7-014efeee8ca4}} in the
context of Newton's gravity; the latter Newtonian derivation is
later known to be a guided one by the already derived Einstein
gravity result {{cite:e57be96f-7710-4e2f-a792-15067fddd13c}}. In the case of linear
perturbations, the relativistic/Newtonian correspondence was also
known in the zero-pressure medium by the work of Lifshitz in 1946
{{cite:ea3b2362-43c0-44ff-9513-11b415c26adf}} in the context of Einstein's gravity, and by
the work of Bonnor in 1957 {{cite:c07defbe-d05a-415b-9507-f6277de301f4}} in the context of
Newton's gravity. The fully nonlinear perturbation equations in the
context of Newtonian cosmology in a zero-pressure medium were known
in a textbook by Peebles in 1980 {{cite:931f3f93-0094-471d-9cb6-3859e28b9ce4}}. The Einstein's
gravity counterpart of the nonlinearly perturbed cosmological
medium, especially the continued relativistic/Newtonian
correspondence even to the second order, was first shown only
recently in our works in {{cite:69303bc4-8df5-466a-a9bc-e8aef3369082}}, {{cite:a6bd7f84-4bca-470c-9869-6617db5bd463}}.
Meanwhile, in {{cite:f28885fc-23c7-4532-bdab-3374f2d90169}}, we derived pure general
relativistic correction terms appearing in the third-order single
component, zero-pressure, irrotational fluid in a flat background.
Thus, now it is a natural step to find out the potential third-order
pure general relativistic correction terms appearing in the
multi-component, zero-pressure, irrotational fluids in a flat
background. As the Newtonian system has only quadratic nonlinearity
even in the multi-component situation, see Sec. II of
{{cite:4cb25cc7-d422-45e5-a385-779ef0a4b838}}, any nonvanishing third-order terms can be
regarded as pure general relativistic corrections. The situation is
also practically important because current stage of the universe is
supposed to be dominated by two zero-pressure components and the
cosmological constant. We will include the effect of cosmological
constant in all our analyses and equations in this work which is
also true in our previous works in
{{cite:69303bc4-8df5-466a-a9bc-e8aef3369082}}, {{cite:a6bd7f84-4bca-470c-9869-6617db5bd463}}, {{cite:47b85dd3-646e-4132-89bd-a2353a948e72}}, {{cite:f28885fc-23c7-4532-bdab-3374f2d90169}}, {{cite:4cb25cc7-d422-45e5-a385-779ef0a4b838}}.
In Sec.  we present the metric and
fluid quantities perturbed to the third order which will be required
in our calculation. We present fluid quantities for most general
fluids with pressures and stresses which will turn out to be
important even in the zero-pressure situation in our main analysis.
As in the single component case in {{cite:f28885fc-23c7-4532-bdab-3374f2d90169}}, under our
proper choice of variables and gauges we do not need third-order
perturbations of the connection or curvature tensor. In Sec.  we summarize the relativistic equations to
the second order, and their effective correspondence with the
Newtonian ones even in the multi-component situation. In Sec.  we derive the general relativistic
third-order terms and present equations in the context of Newtonian
gravity with pure general relativistic corrections. We compare our
equations in the multi-component case with the previously derived
ones in a single component. Section  is a
discussion. We often set FORMULA , but recover FORMULA  in the
Newtonian context presentation.

Third-order perturbations
The covariant and ADM equations
In the following we summarize the basic sets of covariant equations
and ADM equations we need in our analysis. These equations, except
for the covariant equations of individual component, are presented
Sec. II of {{cite:69303bc4-8df5-466a-a9bc-e8aef3369082}}; notations can be found in that work. For
original studies of the covariant and the ADM equations, see
{{cite:3754076e-11d1-43fe-841e-dec39fb9b348}}, and {{cite:9a51cbc8-05ce-4851-a96a-d744b87f0831}}, respectively. Although, we will
use the ADM equations in our calculation, the covariant equations
show another aspects of the same fully nonlinear system of
Einstein's equation.
The energy-momentum tenor of a fluid can be decomposed into fluid
quantities as
FORMULA 
Without losing generality, we take the energy frame, thus set
FORMULA . This decomposition is valid even in the
multiple component fluids; in such a case the above fluid quantities
can be regarded as collective fluid quantities. In the
multi-component case we introduce the energy-momentum tensor and
fluid quantities of individual component as
FORMULA 
where, without losing generality, we also took the energy-frame
condition for each component, thus set FORMULA .
For interactions among components we introduce
FORMULA 
In a single component situation, taking the energy-frame (thus,
setting FORMULA ), the energy conservation equation,
the momentum conservation equation, and the Raychaudhury equation
are
FORMULA 
In the multi-component case, taking the energy-frame for
individual component (thus, setting FORMULA ) we
have
FORMULA 
In order to handle cosmological perturbations to the third
order, we also need the momentum constraint equation for a
collective fluid
FORMULA 
In the ADM formulation, the energy conservation, momentum
conservation, and trace of ADM propagation equations are
FORMULA 
In the multi-component case we have
FORMULA 
The momentum constraint equation is
FORMULA 
The above sets of equations are only parts of the covariant and the
ADM equations; for complete sets, see
{{cite:3754076e-11d1-43fe-841e-dec39fb9b348}}, {{cite:9a51cbc8-05ce-4851-a96a-d744b87f0831}}, {{cite:5190b9f0-06ac-4d64-bf79-763cac5da996}}, {{cite:f9f1beb8-ad30-4a43-8684-d89ce0dd0447}}, {{cite:69303bc4-8df5-466a-a9bc-e8aef3369082}}. We will show that, by
taking proper choice of gauges, the scalar-type perturbations to the
third order can be derived from either of the above sets of
equations. We will present the derivation based on the ADM
equations, because the covariant formalism often requires lengthier
calculation in our particular case; of course, the covariant
equations also give the same result. As we will show, however, we
use both formulations simultaneously depending on the convenience.

Metric
Our metric convention is the same as in {{cite:69303bc4-8df5-466a-a9bc-e8aef3369082}}
FORMULA 
where tensor indices of FORMULA  and FORMULA  are
based on FORMULA . To the third order, the inverse
metric becomes
FORMULA 
In order to derive perturbation equations to the third order,
we need the connection only to the second-order. These are presented
in Eq. (52) of {{cite:69303bc4-8df5-466a-a9bc-e8aef3369082}}.
The ADM metric variables follow from Eq. (2) of {{cite:69303bc4-8df5-466a-a9bc-e8aef3369082}} as
FORMULA 
where tensor index of FORMULA  is based on FORMULA 
as the metric; FORMULA  is an inverse metric of
FORMULA  .

Fluid quantities
We introduce perturbations of fluid quantities as
FORMULA 
where tensor indices of FORMULA  and FORMULA  are
based on FORMULA . The above fluid quantities can be
regarded as collective fluid quantities in the case of
multi-component fluids, see below Eq. (REF ). Although we
will consider zero-pressure fluids, it is important to keep the
perturbed pressure (FORMULA ) and anisotropic stress
(FORMULA ) because the collective pressure and
anisotropic stress do not vanish to nonlinear order in the
multi-component fluids even in the zero-pressure case, see Eq. (REF ). In any case, for later
convenience, in this section we will present fluid quantities for
most general fluids.
Components of the four-vector FORMULA  are
FORMULA 
In {{cite:69303bc4-8df5-466a-a9bc-e8aef3369082}}, instead of FORMULA , we used FORMULA  defined
as
FORMULA 
Thus, we have
FORMULA 
Components of FORMULA  are
FORMULA 
From FORMULA  we have
FORMULA 
To the third order, the energy-momentum tensor becomes
FORMULA 
Above relations of four-vectors, energy-momentum tensor, and fluid
quantities are derived for a single component fluid. However, these
are also valid as the collective component in the case of
multi-component fluids. We can easily see that, by replacing these
quantities with the ones of individual component, the same relations
are valid for individual component as well. That is, for an
individual component, say FORMULA -th component, by replacing
FORMULA 
with
FORMULA 
Eqs. (REF )-(REF ) are
valid for the FORMULA -th component.
From Eqs. (REF ),(REF ) we can express the
collective fluid quantities in terms of the individual one. To the
background order we have
FORMULA 
To the third order in perturbations, we can show
FORMULA 
Thus, we have
FORMULA 
The ADM fluid quantities are introduced as
FORMULA 
where tensor indices of FORMULA  and FORMULA  are
based on FORMULA  as the metric. The four-vector FORMULA  is a normal frame four-vector with FORMULA .
Thus by setting FORMULA  we have FORMULA , and Eq. (REF ) gives
FORMULA 
Using Eqs. (REF ),(REF ), Eq. (REF ) gives
FORMULA 
The individual ADM fluid quantities can be found by replacing
FORMULA 
with
FORMULA 
and similarly for the fluid quantities and the energy-momentum
tensor as in Eqs. (REF ),(REF ). From Eq. (REF ) we have
FORMULA 

Decomposition
We decompose the metric into three perturbation types
{{cite:6fcc3bd1-6941-45fc-ab91-1f7270d10314}}
FORMULA 
where superscripts FORMULA  and FORMULA  indicate the transverse
vector-type, and transverse-tracefree tensor-type perturbations,
respectively. Only to the linear-order perturbations in the
homogeneous-isotropic background, these three types of perturbations
decouple and evolve independently. We introduce
FORMULA 
which are spatially gauge-invariant combinations to the linear
order {{cite:5190b9f0-06ac-4d64-bf79-763cac5da996}}. We set
FORMULA 
By using FORMULA  we can avoid third-order expansion of the
trace of extrinsic curvature FORMULA . Identifying FORMULA  with
Newtonian velocity variable later will be an important step in our
analysis, see Eqs. (REF ),(REF ).
For the fluid quantities we decompose
FORMULA 
The perturbed fluid velocity variables FORMULA  and
FORMULA  subtly differ from the ones introduced in
{{cite:69303bc4-8df5-466a-a9bc-e8aef3369082}}, see {{cite:4cb25cc7-d422-45e5-a385-779ef0a4b838}}.

Zero-pressure irrotational fluids in the comoving gauge
The zero-pressure condition sets
FORMULA 
The comoving gauge condition (FORMULA ) and irrotational
condition (FORMULA ) give
FORMULA 
Under these conditions, Eq. (REF )
becomes
FORMULA 
Notice that for the nonlinear perturbations, the collective
pressure FORMULA  and anisotropic stress FORMULA  no
longer vanish even for zero-pressure fluids; also, the collective
energy density FORMULA  is no longer a simple sum of individual
component.
For the ADM fluid quantities, Eq. (REF ) becomes
FORMULA 
For the individual component, Eq. (REF ) gives
FORMULA 

Second-order equations: summary
In this section we summarize our previous work of second-order
perturbations in zero-pressure, irrotational, but multi-component
fluids {{cite:4cb25cc7-d422-45e5-a385-779ef0a4b838}}. The results show that, to the
second order, effectively the relativistic equations coincide with
the Newtonian ones even in the multi-component situation. This
provides a reason to go to the third order in relativistic
perturbation in order to find out pure general relativistic
deviations from Newton's theory. Since the zero-pressure Newtonian
perturbation equations have only quadratic order nonlinearity, any
non-vanishing third-order terms in relativistic analysis can be
regarded as a pure general relativistic correction terms. In
{{cite:f28885fc-23c7-4532-bdab-3374f2d90169}} we presented such third-order correction terms in
a single component case. In the next section we will derive the
third-order correction terms appearing in the multi-component
situation. As the third-order analysis closely follows the case of
second-order, in the following we will derive the second-order
equations directly from the ADM equations presented in Sec. REF .
We consider zero-pressure multi-fluids, thus
FORMULA 
The irrotational condition and the temporal comoving gauge
condition lead to FORMULA , thus we have FORMULA ; as
the spatial gauge condition we take FORMULA , thus FORMULA . To the second-order perturbations, Eq. () gives
FORMULA 
thus
FORMULA 
Using Eqs. (REF ),(REF ), Eqs. (REF ),(),(REF ),()
give
FORMULA 
From Eqs.
(REF ),(),
and Eqs. ()-()
we can derive
FORMULA 
We have recovered FORMULA  using
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  with normalized FORMULA  or FORMULA .
Without the rotational mode, we introduce
FORMULA 
Since we used the comoving gauge condition, to the linear
order, we have
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  to the linear order. To the linear order,
Newtonian velocity perturbation variables are introduced as
{{cite:7e6e9518-74eb-416c-b77a-5eda9078e45f}}
FORMULA 
thus
FORMULA 
Dimensions are
FORMULA 
Thus, we have
FORMULA 
Newtonian correspondence
We assume a flat background, thus FORMULA . Thus, we have
FORMULA  to the linear order even in the presence of the
cosmological constant and multiple components
{{cite:bdad7b81-8316-4178-9be9-b686504220a2}}, {{cite:7e6e9518-74eb-416c-b77a-5eda9078e45f}}, see Eq. (REF ). To the second order, we identify the
Newtonian perturbation variables FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA ,
and FORMULA  as
FORMULA 
Comparison of the consequent relativistic equations with the
Newtonian equations will show apparently why these identifications
are the proper ones. Examination of Eqs. (REF )-()
shows that we need FORMULA  only to the linear order. From
the momentum constraint equation in Eq. (REF ),
see Eq. (197) of {{cite:69303bc4-8df5-466a-a9bc-e8aef3369082}}, we have
FORMULA 
thus
FORMULA 
to the linear order.
Equations
(REF )-()
become
FORMULA 
In {{cite:4cb25cc7-d422-45e5-a385-779ef0a4b838}} we have shown that, to the linear
order, FORMULA  simply decays
FORMULA 
in an expanding phase. Thus, ignoring quadratic combination of
FORMULA  terms, we have
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
Equations
(REF )-() coincide with
the density and velocity perturbation equations of a single
component medium {{cite:a6bd7f84-4bca-470c-9869-6617db5bd463}}; thus, except for the
contribution from gravitational waves, these equations coincide with
ones in the Newtonian context. In the Newtonian context, Eqs. (REF )-() without the
gravitational waves were presented in {{cite:931f3f93-0094-471d-9cb6-3859e28b9ce4}} which are
valid to fully nonlinear order. To the linear order, Eq. () was derived by Lifshitz
{{cite:ea3b2362-43c0-44ff-9513-11b415c26adf}} in the synchronous gauge, and by Nariai
{{cite:714854bc-67fc-4a01-8fad-b29e4f8a4e6c}} in the comoving gauge. In the zero-pressure
medium the free-falling object is also comoving, thus we can impose
both the synchronous gauge and the comoving gauge simultaneously. In
{{cite:47b85dd3-646e-4132-89bd-a2353a948e72}} we compared subtle differences of the
second-order perturbation equations in the synchronous gauge with
the ones in the comoving gauge.
If we further ignore FORMULA  terms appearing in the
pure second-order combinations, Eqs. (REF )-() become
FORMULA 
which coincide with the Newtonian equations except for the
contributions from the gravitational waves. In this context, except
for the contribution from gravitational waves, the above equations
coincide with ones in the Newtonian context even in the
multi-component case. Therefore, we have shown the
relativistic/Newtonian correspondence, except for the contributions
from the gravitational waves, to the second-order perturbations in
the case of multi-component, zero-pressure, irrotational fluids
assuming a flat background.

Third-order equations
We consider irrotational fluids, thus ignore all vector-type
perturbations. As all three-types of perturbations are generally
coupled in nonlinear perturbations, apparently this is an important
assumption we make in this section. In an expanding phase, however,
the linear order rotational perturbations have only decaying mode
due to the angular-momentum conservation. Effects of rotational
perturbations to the second-order perturbations are considered in
our accompanying work in {{cite:4cb25cc7-d422-45e5-a385-779ef0a4b838}}.
We take the temporal comoving gauge
FORMULA 
Together with the irrotational condition FORMULA  we have FORMULA . Equation (REF ) shows
that this leads to FORMULA  for general fluids. As the spatial
gauge condition we take
FORMULA 
In {{cite:69303bc4-8df5-466a-a9bc-e8aef3369082}} we have shown that these gauge conditions fix the
space-time gauge transformation properties completely to all orders
in perturbations. Thus, each perturbation variable under these gauge
conditions has a corresponding unique gauge-invariant combination,
and can be equivalently regarded as gauge-invariant one to all
orders in perturbations.
We consider zero-pressure fluids, thus
FORMULA 
The collective fluid quantities are nontrivial and are
presented in Eq. (REF ).
In our previous study of second-order perturbations, summarized in a
previous section, we showed that FORMULA 
terms simply correspond to pure decaying mode in expanding phase. We
showed that by ignoring these terms we recover complete
relativistic/Newtonian correspondence even in the multi-component
case. Based on this observation, in our third order calculation in
the following we will ignore FORMULA 
terms. If we ignore FORMULA  terms, the
collective fluid quantities in Eq. (REF ) give
FORMULA 
and the ADM fluid quantities in Eqs. (REF ),(REF ) become
FORMULA 
Equation () gives
FORMULA 
thus,
FORMULA 
Using Eq. (REF ), Eqs. (REF ),(),(REF ),()
give
FORMULA 
where we recovered FORMULA . Equation () can be
written as
FORMULA 
Equations (REF ) and () are
the same as Eqs. (20) and (21) in {{cite:f28885fc-23c7-4532-bdab-3374f2d90169}} which were
derived in the single component situation.
Combining Eqs. (REF ),() and
Eqs. ()-(), respectively, we
can derive
FORMULA 
All terms in the RHS of Eq. () contain
FORMULA  which decays to the linear order as
FORMULA 
see Eqs. (REF ),(REF ) and
{{cite:4cb25cc7-d422-45e5-a385-779ef0a4b838}}. By setting FORMULA  the
LHS of Eq. () is the same as Eq. (REF ). By setting FORMULA  and
FORMULA , Eq. () becomes Eq. (REF ).
In order to complete Eq. () we need
equations for FORMULA , FORMULA , and
FORMULA  terms to the second-order perturbations.
Equation for FORMULA  is in Eq. (REF )
which gives
FORMULA 
to the second order. The relation between FORMULA  and FORMULA 
can be found in Eq. (23) of {{cite:f28885fc-23c7-4532-bdab-3374f2d90169}}. Recovering the
background curvature, from the momentum constraint equation in Eq. (REF ), we can derive
FORMULA 
to the second order. Equation for FORMULA  to the second order
follows from Eq. (99) in {{cite:69303bc4-8df5-466a-a9bc-e8aef3369082}}. Ignoring FORMULA , thus using Eq. (REF ) for
FORMULA  we can derive
FORMULA 
In a flat background, the RHS is the second order; thus, to the
linear order we have FORMULA . Equation for
FORMULA  to the second order is presented in Eq. (43) of {{cite:f28885fc-23c7-4532-bdab-3374f2d90169}}.
Pure general relativistic corrections
Now, we assume
FORMULA 
thus FORMULA  to the linear order. Based on the
apparent success in second-order perturbations, we continue to use
the identifications made in Eq. (REF ) valid
to the third order, thus
FORMULA 
In the following we consider pure scalar-type perturbations,
thus set FORMULA . Contributions from the
gravitational waves will be considered in the next section.
We need FORMULA  only to the second order. Equation
(REF ) gives
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
Equations (REF )-() become
FORMULA 
Equations (REF ),()
coincide with Eqs. (39),(40) in {{cite:f28885fc-23c7-4532-bdab-3374f2d90169}}. Equation
(REF ) gives
FORMULA 
Equation (REF ),()
give
FORMULA 
Equation (REF ) becomes
FORMULA 
A close examination of above equations reveals the followings.
(i) Equations
(REF ),(),(REF )
are the same as Eqs. (25),(26),(28) in {{cite:f28885fc-23c7-4532-bdab-3374f2d90169}} which are
valid in a single component fluid; we note, however, that FORMULA  correction terms, which simply decay in an
expanding phase, appear even in the second-order perturbations, see
Eqs. (REF ),(),()
above, or {{cite:4cb25cc7-d422-45e5-a385-779ef0a4b838}}.
(ii) If we ignore the FORMULA -indices, Eqs.
(),(),()
are identical to Eqs. (REF ),(),(REF ),
respectively; we note, however, that the presence of FORMULA  correction terms causes differences even in the
second-order perturbations, see Eqs. (REF )-().
(iii) We already showed that, to the second order, even in the case
of multi-component, the general relativistic equations are identical
to the Newtonian ones, thus having relativistic/Newtonian
correspondence. The presence of FORMULA 
correction terms may cause differences, but we have shown that these
corrections are simply decaying in the expanding phase.
(iv) The pure third-order correction terms in the above equations
all involve FORMULA -term to the linear order in various forms of
convolution with the second-order terms. As we took the comoving
gauge FORMULA , the spatial curvature variable FORMULA  is the
same as a gauge-invariant combination FORMULA  to the linear order.
(v) We note that, to the linear order, FORMULA  is one of the
well known conserved quantity in the large-scale
{{cite:4d4d3eae-268a-4020-a255-f81246147c44}}, {{cite:e15abb1f-8220-47e4-a259-5205ef1ae774}}. For FORMULA , but considering general
FORMULA , we have FORMULA , thus
FORMULA 
with vanishing decaying mode (in an expanding phase) to the
leading order in the large-scale expansion
{{cite:bdad7b81-8316-4178-9be9-b686504220a2}}.
(vi) We also note that the value of FORMULA  in the large-scale
is of the same order as the gravitational potential fluctuation
FORMULA  which is again of the same order as the relative
temperature fluctuations FORMULA  of the cosmic microwave
background radiation (CMB). In general we have {{cite:f28885fc-23c7-4532-bdab-3374f2d90169}}
FORMULA

Discussion
In this work we have successfully derived pure general relativistic
correction terms appearing in the third-order perturbations of the
zero-pressure irrotational multi-component fluids in a flat
background. We have ignored FORMULA 
correction terms which simply decay in an expanding phase. Our main
results are presented in Eqs. (REF )-(REF ), and in Eqs. (REF )-() in the presence of the
gravitational waves. The equations for the collective component are
identical to the ones in the single component case. If we further
ignore FORMULA  correction terms, which are
again simply decaying in an expanding phase, the forms of
relativistic correction terms in the individual component are the
same as the ones in the collective component. Our results show that,
even in the multi-component situation, the pure relativistic
correction terms are smaller by a factor
FORMULA 
compared with the relativistic/Newtonian second-order terms and
are independent of the presence of horizon scale.
By taking different temporal gauge condition (hypersurface
condition) we can easily introduce apparently horizon dependent
terms with arbitrarily huge amplitudes. The exact
relativistic/Newtonian correspondence to the second-order
perturbations was available essentially due to our proper choice of
gauge conditions and correct identifications of relativistic
variables with the Newtonian ones. In our third-order extension we
have assumed the same identification holds even in the third-order
perturbations, which might not be necessarily the unique choice.
However, the properties (the smallness of the amplitudes and
independence from the horizon scale) of our third-order correction
terms assure that our choice of the gauge and identifications are
very likely to be the correct and best ones even to the third order.
Our results may have practically important implications in currently
favored cosmological pursuits by assuring the use of Newtonian
physics in the large-scale nonlinear processes which often involve
two-component zero-pressure fluids (say, dust and cold dark matter).
As we have shown the exact relativistic/Newtonian correspondence to
the second order and small horizon-independent third-order
correction terms, it is now more secure to use Newtonian physics
near (and even beyond) the horizon scale which is indeed a
noticeable trend in current cosmological simulations
{{cite:2611fe90-aba4-4b90-a2e7-cda3e490c7ad}}. At this point it might be also worth emphasizing
the effects of rotational perturbations. In
{{cite:4cb25cc7-d422-45e5-a385-779ef0a4b838}} we have shown that the rotational
perturbations to the second-order also have relativistic/Newtonian
correspondence in the small-scale (sub-horizon scale) limit. As the
numerical simulations naturally include the rotational mode, this
might be another good news to the cosmology community based on
Newtonian physics.
Although we have estimated that the third-order pure general
relativistic correction terms are small in the current large-scale
structures, it would be still interesting to see whether cosmology
could reach a stage where FORMULA -factor
smaller correction terms could have noticeable effect on the
large-scale structure formation processes. In either case the
third-order terms we have presented in this work are the first
non-vanishing general relativistic correction terms in Newtonian
nonlinear equations, and may have historical as well as practical
importance in cosmology. Analytic studies in the Newtonian context
of a single component zero-pressure, irrotational fluid have been
actively investigated in {{cite:4509915b-eb9f-4ae6-b3d7-21a0f71f1b8d}}. Whether our general
relativistic corrections appearing in the third order (both in the
single-component and multi-component cases), and corrections
appearing even in the second order by effects of pressure, rotation,
and background curvature, will have noticeable roles in the
large-scale structure formation process are left for future
investigations.
