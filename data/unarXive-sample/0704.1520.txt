We study the kinetic theory of driven granular gases, taking into
account both translational and rotational degrees of freedom. We
obtain the high-energy tail of the stationary bivariate energy
distribution, depending on the total energy FORMULA  and the ratio
FORMULA  of rotational energy FORMULA  to total energy.
Extremely energetic particles have a unique and well-defined
distribution FORMULA  which has several remarkable features: FORMULA  is
not uniformly distributed as in molecular gases; FORMULA  is not
smooth but has multiple singularities. The latter behavior is
sensitive to material properties such as the collision parameters,
the moment of inertia and the collision rate. Interestingly, there
are preferred ratios of rotational-to-total energy. In general,
FORMULA  is strongly correlated with energy and the deviations from a
uniform distribution grow with energy. We also solve for the energy
distribution of freely cooling Maxwell Molecules and find
qualitatively similar behavior.

Introduction
Energy dissipation has profound consequences in granular materials,
especially in dilute gases, where the dynamics are controlled by
collisions {{cite:92ef800c-a3db-46f1-a515-d96b343a3afc}}, {{cite:18658fa5-1451-43ae-b5f6-12c8afccec9c}}, {{cite:c7841387-5a95-4063-8b9a-bd48bbb261ce}}. Dissipation is responsible for many
interesting collective phenomena including clustering
{{cite:fa9242b2-a9a2-4858-9cce-2101e745d1ad}}, {{cite:47546112-d38a-461b-bcf7-0eadc35448e8}}, {{cite:77909804-d283-4ce7-aa5a-ebd8f7985fa9}}, {{cite:1babf64a-931e-4165-b1be-e94b6efc059a}}, {{cite:c1bc1654-b18d-4fa0-afcd-dfe9ee2e9a39}}, formation of shocks
{{cite:5e67a637-97c7-4650-a005-0f7e88f59e5b}}, {{cite:4fb09596-d589-4c60-9a82-919321c57bea}}, {{cite:006f94d2-b2d6-4234-a5a6-f4ec17a4466f}}, {{cite:f638e86c-324f-48d0-b810-0ea49f5809be}}, {{cite:d56f204b-3368-4159-bd7f-acd2b2ad2972}}, and hydrodynamic instabilities
{{cite:3948fc21-437c-4a70-84e7-4c2c1bb0c91d}}, {{cite:03527f6d-8868-48c6-b078-34e764ccc583}}. Another consequence is the anomalous statistical physics
that includes the non-Maxwellian velocity distributions
{{cite:bb1c199e-ed51-4422-b5b7-5cc2b60c39be}}, {{cite:c5e87e79-158e-4619-80a9-7871b6397f2f}}, {{cite:db933ade-b75c-4187-bdbc-a2c66b055540}}, {{cite:8c3a823a-c240-4c12-bbdd-078a89a8dcca}}, {{cite:dd1ce047-f78d-4147-a459-72c9323c661b}}, {{cite:7367e2a2-9523-48a7-b383-09d25db0091e}} and the breakdown of energy
equipartition in mixtures {{cite:849d7f30-02c1-42c6-a23c-4bcf5d43f7e9}}, {{cite:d0d05fc5-41b3-4ee7-b49b-95750f164368}}.
For an elastic gas in equilibrium, the temperature, defined as the
average kinetic energy, characterizes the entire distribution function
including all of the moments, the bulk of the distribution, as well as
the tail of the distribution. Outside of equilibrium, the temperature
is not sufficient to characterize the energy distribution. Granular
gases are inherently out of equilibrium and a complete
characterization must therefore include the behavior of typical
particles, the behavior of energetic particles, as well as the moments
of the distribution. For example, the energy distribution may have
power-law tails with divergent high-order moments {{cite:1fa45d06-d1ec-4f59-a887-514116a6152d}}, {{cite:fca8637c-2305-433c-8f0d-2c7cad492568}}, {{cite:c3fc1cfc-553f-439a-97ac-6a84ac911add}} and
consequently, the moments exhibit multiscaling {{cite:c67ffd6f-616b-4300-a598-dce8c12983ce}}. Generally,
nonequilibrium effects are pronounced in the absence of energy input
to balance the dissipation but can be suppressed by injection of
energy where the deviation from a Maxwellian distribution affects only
extremely energetic particles {{cite:c5e87e79-158e-4619-80a9-7871b6397f2f}}, {{cite:00402a11-6c41-4648-bac8-816d85b639ce}}, {{cite:46a9c5ff-be5c-4e57-a914-9a9f5b41f29e}}, {{cite:deb4a8d6-0101-45a2-9f44-af95415842f6}}.
While there is substantial understanding of the energy distribution of
frictionless granular gases, much less is known theoretically
{{cite:2b962a56-5c82-4879-a2f7-3187df51605d}}, {{cite:f677d166-e933-4457-83d1-dad8cf509d97}}, {{cite:84e6c42c-3e39-4f3d-8aec-275901a0d6d5}}, {{cite:3ea2b52d-7eb2-44db-9fd1-d851aa3d35d1}}, {{cite:d3f3eff9-a190-450d-b0da-acf2d8a6dcef}}, {{cite:ae3054e7-683f-46bb-8223-a56641a76b03}}, {{cite:2237bded-b97f-4c4f-bab6-3a2cfc759d2e}}, {{cite:9399e835-ce51-4f76-92fa-e6a960a1835e}} and experimentally
{{cite:f5e55ace-c4b3-430a-a411-22954d9ecbcb}}, {{cite:dec3986c-bd59-42ef-80a0-e744c6b71352}}, {{cite:834443d7-4669-49e1-a2dd-4c00ddeac082}} when the rotational degrees of freedom are taken
into account. It is difficult to measure the rotational motion
experimentally, and the few available measurements are restricted to
two-dimensions. Surface roughness and friction have important
consequences and the hydrodynamic theory {{cite:587a0df4-297e-4fd3-8a21-40b98930ae4f}}, {{cite:c0907f3b-322a-4640-b570-c7214ddafdf7}}, {{cite:348696bd-ca78-4ae1-8347-4223887e3edf}}, {{cite:7236f1f8-d369-4602-a643-8c28767129cc}} must be
modified, if the particles have spin {{cite:9377e294-ff62-4e67-b938-1ad83ee98fa3}}. Equipartition does
not hold for the average rotational and translational temperature –
neither in the free cooling case {{cite:84e6c42c-3e39-4f3d-8aec-275901a0d6d5}}, {{cite:3ea2b52d-7eb2-44db-9fd1-d851aa3d35d1}}, {{cite:d3f3eff9-a190-450d-b0da-acf2d8a6dcef}}, {{cite:ae3054e7-683f-46bb-8223-a56641a76b03}} nor for a
driven system {{cite:2237bded-b97f-4c4f-bab6-3a2cfc759d2e}}. In general, rotational and linear degrees
of freedom are correlated in direction {{cite:4d199989-beaa-467f-99de-61d5f9c98ffb}}.
In this paper, we investigate the nature of the full energy
distribution, that is, the bivariate distribution of rotational and
translational energy. Motivated by the fact that on average the total
energy is not partitioned equally between rotational and translational
degrees of freedom, we focus on the bivariate distribution FORMULA  of
total energy FORMULA  and the modified ratio FORMULA  of rotational
to total energy. We thereby generalize the understanding of
frictionless granular matter in terms of the energy distribution to
rough grains.
Our starting point is the nonlinear Boltzmann equation with a
collision rule that accounts for the coupling of translational and
rotational motion due to tangential restitution. We study stationary
solutions of the inelastic Boltzmann equation that describe steady
states achieved through a balance between energy injections that are
powerful but rare and energy dissipation through inelastic
collisions. For high-energy particles we derive a linear equation for
the bivariate energy distribution. The latter can be shown to
factorize – FORMULA  – into a product of the distribution
of the total energy, FORMULA , and the distribution of the fraction of
energy stored in the rotational degrees of freedom, FORMULA . The former
distribution decays algebraically with energy: FORMULA . The fraction of energy stored in rotational motion is
universal for energetic particles in the sense that FORMULA  approaches
a limiting distribution independent of energy. Furthermore, this
quantity has a number of interesting features. First, the
distribution is not uniform, as it would be, if equipartition were to
hold. Second, the distribution is not analytic but has singularities
at special energy ratios. Third, the distribution and in particular
its singularities depend sensitively on the moment of inertia and the
collision parameters. Only for energetic particles is this
distribution well defined. In general, the partition of energy into
rotational and translational motion depends on the magnitude of the
energy. This paper specifically addresses two-dimensions, although
the theoretical approach and the reported qualitative behavior are
generic.
We also develop a general framework for describing high-energy
collisions and we use this framework to study freely cooling Maxwell
Molecules where the moments of the energy distribution can be found in
a closed form. For example, the two granular temperatures
corresponding to the rotational and translational motions are coupled
and generally, they are not equal. The high-energy behavior found for
driven steady-states extends to freely cooling gases.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We review the
collision rules and introduce the nonlinear kinetic theory in section
II. We then derive the linear kinetic theory for high-energy particles
in section III. Next, in section IV, we study driven steady states and
solve for the stationary energy distribution. Freely cooling Maxwell
molecules are discussed in section V and we conclude in section
VI. The Appendices detail technical derivations.

The Nonlinear Kinetic Theory
Our system consists of an infinite number of identical particles with
mass FORMULA , radius FORMULA , and moment of inertia FORMULA  where FORMULA  is a dimensionless quantity. Each particle has a linear
velocity FORMULA  and an angular velocity FORMULA . Its total energy
is shared by the linear and the rotational motion, FORMULA , or explicitly,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA .
In a collision between two particles, their velocities FORMULA  with the labels FORMULA , change according to
FORMULA 
where the postcollision velocities are denoted by primes. In a binary
collision, rotational and translational energy are exchanged, while
the total energy decreases. In this study, we consider tangential
restitution in addition to the standard normal restitution. Let FORMULA  be the position of particle FORMULA , then the directed unit vector
connecting the centers of the colliding particles is FORMULA . We term this vector
the impact direction. The collision rules are most transparent in
terms of FORMULA  the particle velocity at the contact point
FORMULA 


The inelastic collision laws state that the normal component of the
relative velocity FORMULA  is reversed and
reduced by the normal restitution coefficient FORMULA . The
tangential component is either reversed (rough particles) or not
(smooth particles) and in any case reduced by the tangential
restitution coefficient FORMULA , according to the following
collision rules:
FORMULA 
Inelastic collisions conserve linear and angular momentum.
Conservation of linear momentum implies that the total linear
velocity does not change, and conservation of angular momentum
enforces that the angular momentum of each particle with respect to the
point of contact remains the same, because there is no torque acting at
the point of contact. The collision laws () combined with these
conservation laws specify the postcollision velocities as linear
combinations of the precollision velocities {{cite:84e6c42c-3e39-4f3d-8aec-275901a0d6d5}}
FORMULA 


where the shorthand notations FORMULA  and
FORMULA  were introduced. These collision
rules involve the normal and tangential collision parameters, defined
as
FORMULA 
Their range of values is bounded by FORMULA 
and FORMULA . Details of the derivation of
the collision rules are given in Appendix A, as they are relevant
for our discussion. The energy dissipation, FORMULA , is given by
FORMULA 
The energy dissipation is always positive, except when the collisions
are elastic, FORMULA  and FORMULA  (perfectly smooth spheres) or
FORMULA  (perfectly rough spheres).
The collision rate FORMULA  is the rate by which the
two particles approach each other. For hard spheres, this rate is
simply the normal component of the relative velocity, but we study the
general case
FORMULA 
with FORMULA . Of course, the collision rate vanishes,
FORMULA , when the particles are moving away from each other, FORMULA . When particles interact via the
central potential FORMULA  then FORMULA 
{{cite:1b5f4f7f-b646-440c-b1d2-34e29251c9dc}}. The two limiting cases are hard spheres (FORMULA ) and
Maxwell molecules (FORMULA ) where the collision rate is
independent of the velocity {{cite:d6a5d676-4b02-401c-95f0-fe73e6e3a851}}, {{cite:29d0d0a6-e700-4c71-a4d2-f1f1ac759d10}}, {{cite:d743c393-fb29-42b8-bbff-558a87c678ae}}, {{cite:267e7a9a-5339-4cba-bd65-acacbb151afd}}.
The central quantity in kinetic theory is the probability FORMULA  that a particle has the velocities FORMULA  at
time FORMULA . We study spatially homogeneous situations where this
velocity distribution function is independent of position. Under
the strong assumption that the velocities of the two colliding
particles are completely uncorrelated, the velocity distribution
obeys the Boltzmann equation
FORMULA 
We integrate over all impact directions with FORMULA 
{{cite:a7133d25-8f1c-44bf-9dd9-989e616a02d6}} and over the precollision velocities weighted by
the respective probability distributions. There are two gain terms
and two loss terms, because the velocities of interest FORMULA  can be identified with any one of the four velocities
in the collision rule (REF ) and the kernel is simply the
collision rate (REF ).

The Linear Kinetic Theory
The focus of this study is the energy distribution that generally
depends only on two variables: FORMULA  and FORMULA . It is our aim to
compute the distribution FORMULA  for asymptotically large
energies. This will be done for a system which is driven at very high
energies as well as for an undriven system.
As a first step to this goal, we simplify the Boltzmann equation in
the limit of large energies. Extremely energetic particles are rare
and as a result it is unlikely that such particles will encounter each
other. Hence, energetic particles typically collide with much slower
particles. Since the collision rules are linear, the velocity of the
slower particle barely affects the outcome of the collision. We can
therefore neglect the slower velocity. Substituting FORMULA  and FORMULA  or FORMULA  and FORMULA 
into () gives the cascade process {{cite:a1d806ac-8016-4c36-b336-675df2f57192}}, {{cite:04f5ea81-0525-4423-8acf-f75b995820f2}}
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the precollision velocity of the
energetic particle and FORMULA  with FORMULA  are the
consequent postcollision velocities. With these definitions, the
collision rules for extremely energetic particles are
FORMULA 


where we have set FORMULA , so that the moment of inertia, FORMULA , is
dimensionless. A collision between a high-energy particle and a
typical-energy particle produces two energetic particles with an
energy total that is smaller than the initial energy. This cascade
process transfers energy from large scales to small scales.
Since the cascade process (REF ) involves only one
particle, the tail of the probability distribution FORMULA  obeys the linear equation
FORMULA 
There are two gain terms and one loss term according to the cascade
process (REF ). Formally, this linear rate equation can be
obtained from the full nonlinear equation (REF ) by
treating either one of the precollision velocities as negligible and
then integrating over this small velocity. This procedure leads to
four gain terms and two loss terms and thus, the factor FORMULA  in
(REF ) drops out. We stress that the linear equation
(REF ) is valid only in the high-energy limit.
We also comment that the linear equation (REF ) for the
high-energy tail of the velocity distribution may be valid in cases
where the full nonlinear equation is not. Whereas the nonlinear
equation requires that all possible velocities are uncorrelated, the
linear equation merely requires that energetic particles are
uncorrelated with typical particles. This is a much weaker condition.
In this paper, we restrict ourselves to two space dimensions, i.e.
rotating disks. In that case the rotational velocities are always
perpendicular to the linear velocities. Thus, we conveniently denote
the unit vector in the tangential direction by FORMULA  and the
unit vector coming out of the plane by FORMULA , such that
FORMULA  and FORMULA . The precollision velocities of the energetic particle
FORMULA  and FORMULA  are compactly written as FORMULA . With
this notation, the postcollision velocities specified in
(REF ) are
FORMULA 
respectively. We now treat the three velocity components, namely the
normal component of the velocity FORMULA , the tangential component of
the velocity FORMULA , and the scaled angular velocity FORMULA  as a
three dimensional vector with magnitude FORMULA , polar angle
FORMULA , and azimuthal angle FORMULA :
FORMULA 
The magnitude FORMULA  gives the energy
FORMULA  while the polar
angle characterizes the fraction of energy stored in the rotational
degree of freedom, FORMULA . In this
representation, the postcollision velocities are three-dimensional
vectors with magnitude FORMULA , polar angle FORMULA ,
and azimuthal angle FORMULA . The collision rules
() allow us to express these quantities in terms of
FORMULA :
FORMULA 
where FORMULA . The magnitudes of the postcollision velocities are
proportional to the magnitude of the precollision velocity. The
three velocity components are scaled by three dimensionless constants
FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA , that depend on the angles FORMULA  and
FORMULA  of the energetic particle, the collision parameters FORMULA 
and FORMULA , and the moment of inertia FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
The new energies are proportional to the precollision energies
FORMULA 
We term the parameters FORMULA  the contraction parameters.
Since the collisions are dissipative, these parameters
satisfy the inequality FORMULA . The equality
FORMULA  holds only for elastic collisions
(FORMULA ). The energy dissipation is FORMULA  with FORMULA  or
explicitly,
FORMULA 
The polar and azimuthal angles are given by
FORMULA 
respectively.
Let us represent solid angles by FORMULA . With
this definition, the cascade process () is
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  and FORMULA  given by (REF ) and
(REF ). Energetic particles have an important property:
the solid angle is not coupled to the energy! Indeed, the
postcollision angles depend only on the precollision angle. The
cascade process has the following geometric interpretation: a three
dimensional vector is duplicated into two vectors. Subsequently,
these two vectors are scaled down by the contraction parameters
(REF ), and rotated according to the angular transformation
(REF ).
We can now write the linear Boltzmann equation for FORMULA , the
distribution of energy and solid angle, in a closed form
FORMULA 
Time was rescaled, FORMULA , to absorb the constant which
arises from replacing velocity by energy in the collision rate
(REF ). Henceforth, we implicitly assume that the distribution
FORMULA  is independent of FORMULA  because the distribution of
linear velocities must be isotropic. The integration over the
energy is performed using the collision rule (REF ), leading
to the linear rate equation for the tail of the energy distribution
FORMULA 
 This is a non-local equation as the density of particles with energy
FORMULA  is coupled to the density of particles with the higher energies
FORMULA  and FORMULA . We stress that this equation is a
straightforward consequence of the cascade process (REF )
and that it can also be derived from the full nonlinear Boltzmann
equation. Yet, there may be situations where the linear equation
(REF ) is valid, while the nonlinear equation
(REF ) is not valid. The bivariate energy distributions
FORMULA  and FORMULA  are completely equivalent but we
analyze the former because the cascade process (REF ) is
transparent in terms of the total energy and the solid angle.

Driven Steady-states
The inelastic Boltzmann equation admits stationary solutions for
frictionless particles. These stationary solutions describe
driven steady-states with rare but powerful injection of energy. The
injected energy cascades from high-energies down to small energies,
thereby balancing the energy lost in collisions. At energies below
the injection scale, Eqs. (REF ), (REF ) and
(REF ) are not altered by the energy source and
consequently, the stationary solution of the inelastic Boltzmann
equation holds up to this large energy scale {{cite:a1d806ac-8016-4c36-b336-675df2f57192}}, {{cite:04f5ea81-0525-4423-8acf-f75b995820f2}}. Here,
we seek a corresponding stationary solution for particles with rotational degrees of freedom in the high energy limit.
The stationary solution has to fulfill Eq. (REF ) with the left
hand side set to zero
FORMULA 
At high-energies, the solid angle is not coupled to the energy, as
follows from Eq. (REF ). This fact has a major
consequence: the bivariate energy distribution FORMULA  takes the
form of a product of the energy distribution FORMULA  and the distribution of solid angle,
FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
as FORMULA . The angle distribution is normalized, FORMULA . It does not depend on the
azimuthal angle, because on average the two components of the linear
velocity are equivalent. Due to the equi-dimensional (in FORMULA )
structure of the steady-state equation (REF ), the
product ansatz (REF ) is a solution when the distribution
FORMULA  decays algebraically
FORMULA 
as FORMULA  {{cite:a1d806ac-8016-4c36-b336-675df2f57192}}, {{cite:04f5ea81-0525-4423-8acf-f75b995820f2}}. We obtain a closed equation for the
distribution FORMULA  by substituting the product ansatz
(REF ) with the power-law form (REF ) into the
steady-state equation (REF )
FORMULA 
This equation is linear in FORMULA . However, it is nonlinear in
FORMULA  and moreover, the solid angles
FORMULA  in (REF ) and the
contraction parameters FORMULA  in
(REF ) are complicated functions of the solid angle
FORMULA .
Equation (REF ) involves two unknowns quantities, the exponent
FORMULA  and the distribution function FORMULA . A solution does not
exist for arbitrary values of FORMULA . In fact, there is one and only
one value of FORMULA  for which there is a solution for FORMULA . This
is the value selected by the cascade dynamics! In other words,
(REF ) is an eigenvalue equation: FORMULA  is the eigenvalue and
FORMULA  is the eigenfunction. This eigenvalue equation circumvents
the full nonlinear equation (REF ) and thus, represents a
significant simplification.
The physical interpretation of (REF ) involves a cascade
process in which the solid angle undergoes a creation-annihilation
process
FORMULA 
Here, FORMULA  for
FORMULA  and FORMULA . There is one annihilation process and two
creation processes. These processes have relative weights that reflect
the powerlaw decay of FORMULA . At the steady-state, the creation and
the annihilation terms balance (see Appendix ), as
reflected in the integrated form of (REF )
FORMULA 
To achieve a steady-state, FORMULA  for FORMULA  and therefore
FORMULA . Since FORMULA , we have the lower
bound FORMULA .
We can immediately check that for elastic collisions,
FORMULA  {{cite:694b6a2b-56af-431f-ad5b-902019944294}}, {{cite:5957a221-24df-4230-b486-d0806802badb}} because FORMULA , and
therefore, we conclude the bounds FORMULA . The exponent FORMULA  varies continuously with the
restitution coefficients FORMULA  and FORMULA  and the normalized moment
of inertia FORMULA . This quantity must coincide with the value found
for frictionless particles where tangential restitution is
irrelevant (FORMULA ) {{cite:a1d806ac-8016-4c36-b336-675df2f57192}}, {{cite:04f5ea81-0525-4423-8acf-f75b995820f2}}, {{cite:eb5aff46-0b20-4112-a8bf-094217b65e77}}, but otherwise the
exponent is distinct, as shown in Fig. REF . Also, the
exponent FORMULA  increases monotonically with FORMULA  and FORMULA . We
conclude that the rotational degrees of motion do affect the
power-law behavior (REF ).
FIGURE 
The azimuthal angle FORMULA  characterizes the fraction of energy
stored in the rotational mode, FORMULA  with
FORMULA . The angle distribution
FORMULA  therefore captures the
partition of energy into rotational and translational energies. We
introduce the natural variable FORMULA  defined by
FORMULA  so that
FORMULA 
and present results for the angle distribution FORMULA . In equilibrium, energy is partitioned equally into
all degrees of freedom and therefore FORMULA 
or equivalently,
FORMULA 
for FORMULA . In particular, FORMULA .
Simulation Methods
We numerically studied the angle distribution FORMULA  by solving the
linear eigenvalue equation (REF ) for the “angular” process
(REF ) and by solving the full nonlinear Boltzmann equation
(REF ) for the collision process (REF ). Both of
these equations are solved using Monte Carlo simulations.
The eigenvalue equation is solved by mimicking the angular process.
Throughout the simulation, the value FORMULA  is fixed. There are FORMULA 
particles, each with a given polar angle. A particle with polar angle
FORMULA  is picked at random and then, a random azimuthal angle
FORMULA  is drawn. The polar angles FORMULA  and FORMULA  are then
calculated according to (REF ). The original particle is
annihilated with probability FORMULA  and simultaneously, a new
particle with angle FORMULA  is created with probability FORMULA 
and similarly, a second particle with angle FORMULA  is created with
probability FORMULA . Therefore, the number of particles may increase
by one, remain unchanged, or decrease by one. The exponent FORMULA  is
the value that keeps the total number of particles constant in the
long time limit. The eigenvalue FORMULA  is calculated by repeating this
simulation for various values of FORMULA  and then using the bisection
method {{cite:a51c23ce-967b-43de-bf01-ee90ac652285}}. We present Monte Carlo simulations of 100
independent realizations with FORMULA  particles.
Driven steady-states are obtained by simulating the two competing
processes of inelastic collisions and energy injection. In an
inelastic collision, two particles are picked at random and also,
the impact direction is chosen at random. The particle velocities
are updated according to the collision law (). Collisions
are executed with probability proportional to the collision rate.
Throughout this process, we keep track of the total energy loss.
With a small rate, we augment the energy of a randomly selected
particle by an amount equal to the loss total and subsequently,
reset the total energy loss to zero. A fraction of the injected
energy is rotational and the complementary fraction is
translational. We draw this fraction according to the equilibrium
distribution (REF ). We experimented with different angle
distributions and found that the resulting stationary state did not
change.
Obtaining the distribution FORMULA  is generally challenging as it
requires excellent statistics. The simulations are most efficient for
Maxwell molecules because all possible collisions are equally likely.
Therefore, for the full nonlinear Boltzmann equation
(REF ), we present the angle distribution of the energetic
particles only for the case FORMULA .
For Maxwell molecules, the injection rate is FORMULA  and the system
size is FORMULA . The corresponding values for hard spheres are
FORMULA  and FORMULA . In all cases, the simulation results represent
an average over FORMULA  independent realizations. Unless noted
otherwise, the simulation results are for maximally dissipative
(FORMULA ) disks (FORMULA ).

The Distribution of Total Energy
The numerical simulations confirm several of our theoretical
predictions. First, the energy distribution approaches a
steady-state with a power-law high-energy tail. Second, the
distribution of the total energy FORMULA  decays algebraically as in
(REF ). Third, the exponent FORMULA  is in excellent
agreement with the predictions of the eigenvalue equation. For
Maxwell molecules, Monte Carlo simulation of the full nonlinear
equation yields FORMULA  whereas numerical solution of
the eigenvalue equation (REF ) gives FORMULA 
(Fig. REF ). For hard-spheres, where the simulation
results are slightly less accurate, the corresponding values are
FORMULA  and FORMULA  (Fig. REF ).
The behavior of the distribution of total
energy is therefore qualitatively similar to the behavior in the
no-rotation case {{cite:a1d806ac-8016-4c36-b336-675df2f57192}}, {{cite:04f5ea81-0525-4423-8acf-f75b995820f2}}. However, the quantitative behavior
is different because the exponent FORMULA  does depend on the
tangential restitution coefficient and the moment of inertia
(Fig. REF ).

The Angle distribution
The numerical simulations also confirm several of our theoretical
predictions concerning the angle distribution. Extremely energetic
particles have a universal distribution FORMULA . This
distribution is independent of the energy, provided that the energy is
sufficiently large. We had to probe only the most energetic particle
out of roughly FORMULA  particles to measure this distribution. For
this reason, the linear analysis and the resulting eigenvalue equation
are valuable because they allow for an accurate and efficient
determination of the angle distribution of the energetic particles.
We also verified that the distribution FORMULA  obeys the eigenvalue
equation (REF ), as demonstrated in Fig. REF ,
where the simulations are compared to the solution of the angular
process.
FIGURE 
The distribution FORMULA  has several noteworthy features. First, it
is not uniform, implying the breakdown of energy equipartition in a
granular gas. Furthermore, this distribution is nonanalytic.
It contains singularities and discontinuous derivatives. There are
notable peaks in the distribution so that special values FORMULA  and
special ratios FORMULA  are strongly preferred. The reason for these
peaks is the fact that the polar angle is limited. For example,
FORMULA  as seen by substituting FORMULA 
into () and (REF ). Consequently, there is a
special ratio
FORMULA 
with the corresponding special energy ratio FORMULA . This is
the most pronounced peak in Fig. REF ,
FORMULA . Numerically, we observe that the
peak becomes more pronounced as the distribution is measured at a
finer scale, indicating that the distribution function diverges at
this point.
Similarly, there is another special ratio that corresponds to
FORMULA  when FORMULA , and unlike (REF ), this
location depends on the tangential restitution,
FORMULA 
Indeed, there is a barely noticeable cusp at
FORMULA . Singularities may induce less pronounced
“echo”-singularities. For example, using FORMULA  and
FORMULA  yields the special ratio
FORMULA 
There is a noticeable peak at the corresponding value
FORMULA  in Fig. REF . We anticipate
that as the transformation (REF ) is iterated, the
strength of the singularities weakens and as a result there are
discontinuous derivatives of increasing order, a subtle behavior that
is difficult to measure.
FIGURE 
The location of the singularities varies with the collision parameters
FORMULA  and FORMULA  and the moment of inertia FORMULA . In fact, the angle
distribution is extremely sensitive to material properties as its
shape changes dramatically with these parameters, see
Fig. REF . The angle distribution also depends on the
collision rate and it is much smoother for hard spheres, see
Fig. REF . Since the collision rate vanishes for grazing
collisions, FORMULA , the associated singularities including in
particular (REF ) are suppressed. Nevertheless, there is a
pronounced jump at the special ratio given by (REF ) and
there are also noticeable cusps.
The angle distribution of all particles FORMULA  is shown in Fig. REF . It is
substantially different from FORMULA . Therefore, the energy
distribution FORMULA  does not factorize in general and there
are correlations between the solid angle and the total energy. Only
for energetic particles does (REF ) hold. Moreover, FORMULA  is much smoother in comparison with FORMULA  although there
is a jump in the first derivative at the special ratio
(REF ) showing that the angle distribution of all
particles is also non-analytic, see Fig. REF . Generally,
the angle distribution depends on energy and the deviation from a
uniform distribution grows with energy.
We also comment that lone measurement of the moment FORMULA  can be misleading. The angle distribution may very well
have a value close to the equipartition value FORMULA  but still, be very far from the equilibrium
distribution. Indeed, in Fig. REF , FORMULA , a value that barely differs from the
equilibrium value, even though the corresponding distribution is far
from uniform. The second moment may also differ substantially from the
equipartition value and for example, FORMULA  when
FORMULA  and FORMULA  (Fig. REF ).
We argue that the qualitative features of the angle distribution
should be generic in granular materials. Collisions involving
energetic particles must follow the linear cascade rules
(REF ) with the angular transformations
(REF ). The singularities are a direct consequence of
these transformations and therefore should be generic. Measuring the
parameter-sensitive distribution FORMULA  experimentally is
challenging because a huge number of particles must be probed and
the measurement has to be accurate. The distribution FORMULA  provides a detailed probe of the partition of energy into
rotational and translation motion.

Free Cooling
We now consider freely cooling granular gases that evolve via purely
collisional dynamics. Without energy input, all energy is eventually
dissipated and the particles come to rest. This system has been
studied extensively {{cite:92ef800c-a3db-46f1-a515-d96b343a3afc}} for hard spheres with {{cite:84e6c42c-3e39-4f3d-8aec-275901a0d6d5}}, {{cite:4d199989-beaa-467f-99de-61d5f9c98ffb}}
and without rotation {{cite:6e694802-e42a-4390-b255-198979fa4d8f}}.
We consider Maxwell molecules where in the absence of rotation an
exact treatment is possible {{cite:1fa45d06-d1ec-4f59-a887-514116a6152d}}, {{cite:fca8637c-2305-433c-8f0d-2c7cad492568}}, {{cite:c67ffd6f-616b-4300-a598-dce8c12983ce}}, {{cite:c56cadc4-420b-4655-9178-6f514618a9cf}}, {{cite:cbd3e6af-efc9-4e6d-a8a4-8e91bb5cf8b2}}. When
FORMULA  the Boltzmann equation (REF ) simplifies
FORMULA 
Consequently, the equations for the moments FORMULA  close.
The Temperatures
Here, we consider only the translational temperature defined as the
average translational energy, FORMULA , and the
rotational temperature, defined as the average rotational energy
FORMULA . These two temperatures are coupled through
the linear equation
FORMULA 
Appendix  details the derivation of the matrix of
coefficients
FORMULA 


The two temperatures are coupled as long as FORMULA  or
alternatively, FORMULA .
The solution of (REF ) is a linear combination of the two
eigenvectors
FORMULA 
with the constants FORMULA  and FORMULA  set by the initial conditions,
and FORMULA . The
eigenvalues are
FORMULA 
The larger eigenvalue is irrelevant in the long time limit and
therefore,
FORMULA 
such that both temperatures decay with the same rate
FORMULA . Of course, the total temperature also
follows the same exponential decay, FORMULA . In this regime, the fraction of rotational energy is on
average
FORMULA 
The approach toward this value is exponentially fast and the
relaxation time is inversely proportional to the difference in
eigenvalues FORMULA .
In equilibrium, FORMULA  but for nonequilibrium granular gases the
ratio varies. In Fig. 8 we plot the ratio of the average rotational
energy to the total energy as a function of the coefficients of
restitution. In accordance with our findings for driven steady-states,
energy is not partitioned equally between all the degrees of freedom.

The Energy Distribution
To study the full energy distribution, it is again convenient to
make a transformation of variables from the velocity pair FORMULA  to the total energy and the solid angle FORMULA .
The energy distribution is now time dependent and assuming that the
temperature – FORMULA  – is the characteristic
energy scale we postulate the self-similar form
FORMULA 
with the prefactor ensuring proper normalization, FORMULA . We focus on the high-energy behavior where the
linear equation (REF ) holds. By substituting the scaling form
(REF ) into this linear equation and setting FORMULA , we
find the integro-differential equation governing the scaling function
FORMULA 
We again write the multivariate energy distribution as a product
FORMULA  of the distribution of the total
energy FORMULA  and the distribution of
the solid angle FORMULA . This form is a solution of the
equi-dimensional equation (REF ) when the distribution of the
total energy decays as a power-law
FORMULA 
at large energies, FORMULA . The angle distribution satisfies
the eigenvalue equation
FORMULA 
Of course, setting FORMULA , one recovers the steady-state equation
(REF ) reflecting that the similarity solution is stationary.
The factor 1 is replaced by the smaller factor FORMULA 
that accounts for the constant decrease in the number of particles at
any given energy because of dissipation. Again, we have a nonlinear
eigenvalue equation with the eigenvalue FORMULA  and the eigenfunction
FORMULA .
FIGURE 
We solve this eigenvalue equation by performing a Monte Carlo
simulation of the same angular process as described by
(REF ) but with a different annihilation rate
FORMULA . We compare the angle distribution
predicted by (REF ) with the behavior of the energetic
particles in the freely cooling gas.
The numerical simulations of the inelastic collision process confirm
the theoretical predictions. First, the energy distribution is
self-similar as in (REF ) and the characteristic scale is
proportional to the temperature. Second, the distribution of the
total energy has a power-law tail, as displayed in
Fig. REF  and the exponent FORMULA  is very close to the
theoretical prediction (numerical simulations of the collision
process gives FORMULA  while the eigenvalue equation
yields FORMULA ).
The angle distribution deviates even more strongly from the uniform
distribution with a very pronounced peak (see Fig. REF )
because the dynamics are purely collisional. The singularities are
weaker although the one at FORMULA  given by (REF ) is clear.
The agreement between the solution of the angular process and the
Monte Carlo simulations is slightly worse than for driven systems
because the statistics become prohibitive: now it is necessary to
probe the most energetic out of roughly FORMULA  particles to obtain
the asymptotic angle distribution! The sharper power-law decay is
responsible for this three order of magnitude increase: the
cumulative distribution of total energy decays according to FORMULA  with FORMULA  about three times larger
than before. Finally, the angle distribution of all particles
deviates only slightly from a uniform distribution (see
Fig. REF ). We conclude that the behavior of the
freely cooling gas is qualitatively similar to that found in driven
steady-states.
FIGURE 

Conclusions and Outlook
The complete description of granular media with translational and
rotational degrees of freedom requires the full bivariate distribution
of energies. It is not sufficient to consider only the average kinetic
energy of translations and rotations. Instead the full bivariate
distribution is highly nontrivial. We have shown that in the limit of
large particle energy, this distribution obeys a linear equation. Its
solution can be written as a product of two distributions, one for the
total energy, FORMULA , and one for the variable FORMULA ,
which captures the partition of the total energy between rotational
and translational motion. The distribution of the total energy decays
algebraically and the characteristic exponent depends on the collision
parameters and the moment of inertia. The variable FORMULA  is not
uniformly distributed as in equilibrium. Instead the distribution
FORMULA  is not analytic and displays a series of singularities of
varying strengths. Remarkably, there are special preferred ratios of
rotational-to-total energy. This violation of energy equipartition
among different degrees of freedom is a direct consequence of the
energy dissipation. The total energy and the variable FORMULA  are
correlated in general with the deviations from equilibrium increasing
with energy. These two variable become uncorrelated only at extremely
high-energies.
We have studied both, the system which is driven at extremely high
energies and displays a stationary energy cascade on energy scales
below the driving one, and a freely cooling gas. In the latter gas the
bivariate energy distribution is time dependent, reflecting the
overall decrease of energy. Nevertheless, scaling the total energy
with temperature, one finds a self-similar form for the distribution,
which again factorizes in the high-energy limit. As in the driven
system, the distribution of the total energy decays as a power law
with, however, different exponents for the driven and the free cooling
system. The angular distribution deviates even more from the uniform
(equipartition) one in the cooling system.
It should be straightforward to extend these results to three
dimensions where the angular process takes place in three
dimensions. In the limit of high energies one would again expect a
limiting distribution for the partition angle FORMULA .
Another possible extension refers to a more realistic law of friction,
including Coulomb friction {{cite:f5e55ace-c4b3-430a-a411-22954d9ecbcb}}, {{cite:dec3986c-bd59-42ef-80a0-e744c6b71352}}. Finally, it would be of
interest to extend the analysis to other systems, where equipartition
is violated. An example is a binary mixture, where the energy is
shared unequally between the two components.

The Collision rules
The total linear momentum FORMULA  is conserved in the collision. The angular momenta of the two
particles with respect to the point of contact, FORMULA ,
are given by
FORMULA 


These are conserved, FORMULA  with FORMULA ,
because there is no torque at the point of contact. In inelastic
collisions, the normal and tangential components of the relative
velocity at the point of contact obey the collision law ()
where FORMULA .
It is convenient to introduce the momentum transfer FORMULA ,
defined as follows: FORMULA  and FORMULA . Conservation of the angular velocity
with respect to the point of contact and Eq. () gives
FORMULA .
In terms of FORMULA , the difference in velocity at the point of
contact is FORMULA . Substituting this expression
into the collision laws (), the normal and the tangential
components of FORMULA  are simply
FORMULA 


Consequently, the momentum transfer is FORMULA  or explicitly,
FORMULA 
We now have the explicit collision rules ().

Particle Number Conservation
In this appendix, we verify that the stationary solution is consistent
with particle number conservation. Maxwell Molecules are considered
for simplicity. It is straightforward to generalize this calculation to
all FORMULA  and to free cooling.
Our starting point is Eq. (REF ), specialized to Maxwell
molecules, i.e. FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
As a first step we integrate this equation over the solid angle
FORMULA 
The power-law behavior (REF ) typically holds in a
restricted energy range, FORMULA , where FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are upper and lower cutoffs. In the driven case, the upper
cutoff is set by the energy injection scale. Let
FORMULA  be the total number of particles
in this range. With the powerlaw decay (REF ), then
FORMULA 
To evaluate this time evolution of FORMULA , we substitute the product form
(REF ) into (REF ) and integrate over the energies
in the aforementioned power-law range,
FORMULA 
Using Eq. (REF ), we confirm that the total number of
particles is conserved, FORMULA .

The matrix coefficients
In an inelastic collision, the translational
energy loss is FORMULA  with
FORMULA  and similarly, the rotational energy
loss is FORMULA  with FORMULA .
We can conveniently calculate these quantities by using FORMULA , FORMULA ,
and FORMULA , and
by expressing the momentum transfer FORMULA  using the natural
coordinate system, FORMULA ,
FORMULA 


The rate of change of the respective temperatures equals FORMULA  the
average of this quantities, FORMULA  and FORMULA . This is seen by multiplying (REF ) by
FORMULA  and by integrating over the velocity. The averaging
is with respect to the probability distribution functions of the two
colliding particles. The cross-term vanishes, FORMULA ,
by symmetry. Using FORMULA  and FORMULA  we obtain the matrix elements
(REF ).
