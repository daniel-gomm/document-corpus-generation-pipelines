We prove an existence and uniqueness result for ground states of
one-dimensional Schrödinger-Newton equations.

Introduction
We consider the one-dimensional Schrödinger-Newton system
FORMULA 
which is equivalent to the nonlinear Schrödinger equation
FORMULA 
with nonlocal nonlinear potential
FORMULA 
We are interested in the existence of nonlinear bound states of
the form
FORMULA 
The Schrödinger-Newton system in three space dimensions
FORMULA 
has a long standing history. With FORMULA  designating appropriate
positive coupling constants it appeared first in 1954, then in
1976 and lastly in 1996 for describing the quantum mechanics of a
Polaron at rest by S. J. Pekar  {{cite:bd2d57bb-1bbf-42d2-9dde-e9d0c94ce332}}, of an electron trapped
in its own hole by the first author  {{cite:9c3ec785-a501-4683-b4b4-00c0a7990722}} and of
selfgravitating matter by R. Penrose  {{cite:166b0e0e-c58d-4785-a118-f6bf1a1c565e}}. The
two-dimensional model is studied numerically in  {{cite:e98acf2d-9880-4605-9f7d-e7492d965ac9}}.
For the bound state problem there are rigorous results only for
the three dimensional model. In  {{cite:9c3ec785-a501-4683-b4b4-00c0a7990722}} the existence of a
unique ground state of the form (REF ) is shown by
solving an appropriate minimization problem. This ground state
solution FORMULA  is a positive spherically
symmetric strictly decreasing function. In  {{cite:4ead12f5-e29d-4e7e-8c7e-2bf5d3ec9ed9}} the
existence of infinitely many distinct spherically symmetric
solutions is proven and a proof for the existence of anisotropic
bound states is claimed. So far, there are no results for the
one-dimensional model except for its semiclassical approximation
 {{cite:9bc76c8c-e49b-40fc-9d35-e6ef658dc019}}. One mathematical difficulty of the one-dimensional
problem is that the Coulomb potential does not define a positive
definite quadratic form (see below).
From numerical investigations of the problem we conjecture that in
the attractive case FORMULA  equation (REF ) admits for
each FORMULA  infinitely many nonlinear bound states of the form
(REF ) which means that subject to a normalization
condition FORMULA  the model exhibits an
infinite discrete energy spectrum. In the present letter, we are
interested in the ground states of the model
FORMULA 
We prove for any FORMULA  the existence of an unique spherically
symmetric ground state by solving an appropriate minimization
problem. We also prove the existence of an antisymmetric solution
by solving the same minimization problem restricted to the class
of antisymmetric functions.

Mathematical Framework
Functional Setting
The natural function space FORMULA  for the quasi-stationary problem is given by
FORMULA 
Indeed, for each FORMULA  the energy FORMULA  and the particle number
(or charge) FORMULA  associated to (REF ) given by
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
respectively, are well-defined quantities. In particular, the
energy functional FORMULA  is of class FORMULA .
The space FORMULA  is a Hilbert space and by Rellich's criterion (see,
e.g. theorem XIII.65 of  {{cite:b8e37090-d9d1-46d4-9ddf-e48b7a7cdf5e}}) the embedding
FORMULA  is compact.

Scaling properties
If FORMULA  is a
solution of the stationary equation
FORMULA 
then FORMULA 
solves
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
In addition, by the virial theorem
FORMULA 

Ground states
Existence of ground states
We consider the following
minimization problem:
FORMULA 
We note that the functional FORMULA  is not convex since the
quadratic form FORMULA  is not positive
so that standard convex minimization does not apply. To see this
choose, for example, FORMULA  where
FORMULA  denotes the characteristic function of the
interval FORMULA . For finite discrete systems it has been shown
that the associated matrix has only one positive eigenvalue
 {{cite:296d3e5f-af38-4244-b98c-8a9214ae968e}}), which was computed in  {{cite:dd265772-15bf-47cc-b835-7674eb72c111}}).
Theorem 3.1 For any FORMULA  there is a spherically symmetric
decreasing FORMULA  such that
FORMULA  and FORMULA .

Let FORMULA  be a minimizing sequence for
FORMULA , that is FORMULA  and
FORMULA . We also may
assume that FORMULA  is uniformly bounded. Denoting FORMULA  the
spherically symmetric-decreasing rearrangement of FORMULA  we have (see
e.g. lemma 7.17 in  {{cite:e124215a-5047-43a2-a942-cf9e438e3ef2}})
FORMULA 
For the potential FORMULA  we apply the following rearrangement
inequality:
Lemma 3.2 Let FORMULA  be two nonnegative functions on FORMULA , vanishing at
infinity with spherically symmetric-decreasing rearrangement
FORMULA  , respectively. Let FORMULA  be a nonnegative spherically
symmetric increasing function. Then
FORMULA 

If FORMULA  is bounded, FORMULA , then FORMULA  and by Riesz's
rearrangement inequality (lemma 3.6 in  {{cite:e124215a-5047-43a2-a942-cf9e438e3ef2}}) we have
FORMULA 
Since
FORMULA 
the claim follows. If FORMULA  is unbounded we define a truncation by
FORMULA  and apply the monotone convergence
theorem.
By the preceding lemma we have
FORMULA 
since FORMULA  is an increasing spherically symmetric function.
Therefore we may suppose that FORMULA . We claim that
FORMULA . Indeed, since FORMULA  is a convex function we have
FORMULA 
by Jensen's inequality and therefore
FORMULA 
proving our claim. We may extract a subsequence which we denote
again by FORMULA  such that FORMULA  weakly in FORMULA ,
strongly in FORMULA  and a.e. where FORMULA  is a nonnegative
spherically symmetric decreasing function. Note that FORMULA 
since FORMULA . We want to show that FORMULA . Since
FORMULA 
it remains to analyze the functional FORMULA . First of all, we note
that for spherically symmetric densities FORMULA  we have
FORMULA 
Let
FORMULA 
Then FORMULA  uniformly since
FORMULA 
Now
FORMULA 
As FORMULA  the first integral will tend to zero while the
second will remain nonnegative since the continuous functional
FORMULA  is positive. Hence
FORMULA 
proving the theorem.

Uniqueness of ground states
As in  {{cite:9c3ec785-a501-4683-b4b4-00c0a7990722}} we need a
strict version of the rearrangement inequality for the potential
energy FORMULA :
Lemma 3.3 If FORMULA  and FORMULA , then we have the strict inequality:
FORMULA 

We write
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is a spherically symmetric strictly decreasing
function and FORMULA  is increasing. Then, from the strict
inequality for strictly decreasing functions (see  {{cite:9c3ec785-a501-4683-b4b4-00c0a7990722}}) we
have FORMULA .
After suitable rescaling the solution of the minimization problem
(REF ) satisfies the stationary equation (REF )
which is equivalent to the system of ordinary differential
equations
FORMULA 
Obviously, FORMULA  for all FORMULA  and after another rescaling we
may assume that the pair FORMULA  satisfies the initial
conditions FORMULA . System
(REF ) is Hamiltonian with energy function given by
FORMULA 
and FORMULA  for any symmetric solution.
Theorem 3.4 The system (REF ) admits a unique symmetric solution
FORMULA  such that FORMULA  and FORMULA  as FORMULA .

Suppose there are two distinct solutions FORMULA ,
FORMULA  having the required properties. We may suppose
FORMULA . For FORMULA  we consider the Wronskian
FORMULA 
Note that FORMULA  and FORMULA  as FORMULA . It satisfies
the differential equation
FORMULA 
Suppose FORMULA  for all FORMULA . Then FORMULA 
for all FORMULA  since FORMULA  and hence
FORMULA  for all FORMULA  which is impossible. Hence there exists
FORMULA  such that FORMULA  for
FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA .
However, then FORMULA , but
FORMULA  for all FORMULA  which is again impossible.

Existence of antisymmetric ground states
We consider the subspace FORMULA  of FORMULA  consisting of
antisymmetric functions, i.e. of functions FORMULA  such that
FORMULA . Repeating the arguments of the proof of theorem 2.1
we prove the existence of a solution of the minimization problem
FORMULA 
which we conjecture to be the first excited state.
Theorem 3.5 For any FORMULA  there is an antisymmetric FORMULA , positive for FORMULA  such that FORMULA  and
FORMULA .

We may restrict the problem to the positive half-axis with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Then
FORMULA 
Let FORMULA  be a minimizing sequence for FORMULA , that is
FORMULA  and FORMULA . We may suppose that the FORMULA  are
nonnegative on the positive half-axis. The rest of the proof
follows the same lines as the proof of theorem 3.1.
Remark 3.6 As in theorem 3.3 we can show that the odd solution FORMULA  of
(REF ) such that FORMULA  for all FORMULA  which
corresponds to the initial conditions FORMULA  is unique.
