The (semi-infinite) Pfaff lattice was introduced by Adler and van Moerbeke
{{cite:f6089eae-58ab-4b14-91d5-4c12d266c39c}} to
describe the partition functions for the random matrix models of
GOE and GSE type.
The partition functions of those matrix models are given by the Pfaffians of certain
skew-symmetric matrices called the moment matrices, and they are the FORMULA -functions of
the Pfaff lattice.
In this paper,
we study a finite version of the Pfaff lattice equation as a Hamiltonian system.
In particular, we prove the complete integrability in the
sense of Arnold-Liouville, and using a moment map, we describe the real isospectral
varieties of the Pfaff lattice. The image of the moment map is a convex polytope
whose vertices are identified as the fixed points of the flow generated by the Pfaff lattice.



Introduction
This paper centers around the finite version of the Pfaff lattice hierarchy.
The Pfaff lattice is a Hamiltonian system, and has many connections to lattices of Toda type.
Our goal is to show the complete integrability of the
Pfaff lattice, and to describe the geometry
of the iso-level sets determined by the integrals of the lattice.
Lie algebra splitting related to SR-factorization
We introduce the Pfaff lattice by starting
with a Lie algebra splitting (see {{cite:ed9f30de-b0b4-4433-ba0c-579de7d50fc6}}, {{cite:f6089eae-58ab-4b14-91d5-4c12d266c39c}} for the semi-infinite case),
FORMULA 
Here the splitting is defined by the projections of an element FORMULA ,
FORMULA 

where FORMULA  is the FORMULA  block diagonal part of FORMULA , FORMULA  (resp. FORMULA ) is
the FORMULA  block upper (resp. lower) triangular part of FORMULA , and FORMULA  is the FORMULA 
matrix with the FORMULA  diagonal blocks,
FORMULA 
We denote FORMULA  with the involution
FORMULA . One finds that
FORMULA . Each element FORMULA  is
expressed by a FORMULA  block lower triangular matrix with FORMULA  block diagonal
part given by FORMULA diagFORMULA  with FORMULA ,
and FORMULA  represents the FORMULA  identity matrix. We also use
the FORMULA  block decomposition for FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  represents the set of FORMULA  block upper (lower) triangular
matrices, and FORMULA  the set of FORMULA  block diagonal matrices.
With the inner product on FORMULA  defined by FORMULA ,
one can define the dual spaces FORMULA  and FORMULA . With the identification FORMULA , we have
FORMULA  with the projections,
FORMULA 

Notice that both FORMULA 
Also FORMULA ,
which gives a vector space decomposition based on the involution
FORMULA , that is,
FORMULA . The FORMULA  is the set of
FORMULA  block lower triangular matrices with block diagonal part
of the form
FORMULA .
Note that FORMULA .
Remark 1.1 The splitting of Lie algebras used here is induced by the
SR-factorization of FORMULA  which
is an FORMULA  version of QR-factorization. This factorization states
that for a dense set of FORMULA  we can find FORMULA  with
FORMULA  and FORMULA 
such that
FORMULA  (see Theorem 3.8 in {{cite:61d06d8c-22e5-47ac-8080-a05241124597}}).
However Theorem 3.7 in {{cite:61d06d8c-22e5-47ac-8080-a05241124597}} shows that
the set of FORMULA  such that the
SR-factorization exists is not dense, for this reason we restrict our
analysis to real matrices. Remark 3.9 in {{cite:61d06d8c-22e5-47ac-8080-a05241124597}} states that the
SR-decomposition as defined in that article is not unique; however our choice
of FORMULA  gives a unique decomposition.

Let us now define a matrix FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
In particular, we choose FORMULA  to be
FORMULA  with FORMULA  and
FORMULA 
Here FORMULA  is the FORMULA  identity matrix, FORMULA  is the FORMULA  zero matrix and FORMULA .
Then the matrix FORMULA  is a lower Hessenberg matrix, and the number of variables in FORMULA  is given by FORMULA .
For example, FORMULA  can be written in the form,
FORMULA 
The number of variables is FORMULA .
This choice of the matrix FORMULA  corresponds to the minimal nontrivial example of the Pfaff lattice
considered in this paper.

Hamiltonian structure
We define a Lie-Poisson bracket FORMULA  for functions FORMULA  on FORMULA  using the FORMULA -matrix FORMULA  with the splitting FORMULA :
For any FORMULA , we define the FORMULA -bracket
FORMULA 

Then the Lie-Poisson bracket is given by
FORMULA 
The Pfaff lattice for FORMULA  is defined by a Hamilton equation with Hamiltonian function FORMULA , i.e.
FORMULA 

The solution of the Pfaff lattice can be expressed as a coadjoint orbit FORMULA  through FORMULA  with FORMULA  and
FORMULA . In general, the coadjoint orbit through FORMULA  can be written in the form,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  with FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Thus the coadjoint action factors into an FORMULA -action on
FORMULA  and a FORMULA -action on FORMULA .
If the Hamiltonian FORMULA  is FORMULA -invariant (i.e. FORMULA ), one can write FORMULA .
With the Hamiltonian FORMULA  (the Chevalley invariants), we define the
Pfaff lattice hierarchy,
FORMULA 
Then the solutions to (REF ) with initial condition FORMULA 
evolve on the adjoint orbit of both FORMULA  and FORMULA  through FORMULA , that is,
(REF ) becomes
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  (we will discuss more details in Section ).
We now give a canonical Lax matrix FORMULA  with a form of the lower Hessenberg matrix (REF )
in the sense that we normalize the invariant elements in FORMULA  under the Pfaff flow of (REF ).
Those invariants are given by the following:
Lemma 1.1 
For FORMULA  and FORMULA  a lower Hessenberg matrix, we have
FORMULA 

Proof. We first have
FORMULA 
where we have used the upper triangular shape of
FORMULA  and the lower Hessenberg form of FORMULA .
One then notes that FORMULA  from the structure of
FORMULA  and the result follows.
The proof of the other equations is a similar direct calculation
which is left to the reader.
   
Lemma REF  implies that FORMULA  and
the traces of the odd
principal parts of FORMULA , FORMULA ,
are invariants of the Pfaff flow (REF ).
We choose values for these expressions so that the phase space of the Pfaff lattice is
FORMULA 
The space FORMULA  with the Lie-Poisson bracket (REF ) defines a Poisson
manifold, and the dimension is given by
FORMULA 
The form of FORMULA  is a finite version of the Pfaff lattice considered in {{cite:f6089eae-58ab-4b14-91d5-4c12d266c39c}} (see (0.12) in Theorem
0.1).
For example in the case of FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
It should be noted that FORMULA  of this form is given by a point on a FORMULA -orbit through
the companion matrix FORMULA , that is, FORMULA  for some FORMULA  and
FORMULA 
where the FORMULA 's are the symmetric functions of the eigenvalues, i.e.
the characteristic polynomial FORMULA . We also denote the real isospectral variety of the Pfaff lattice with FORMULA  as
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  are the invariant polynomials defined by FORMULA 
(see (REF )). Note that the set FORMULA  are equivalent to FORMULA .
The main purpose of this paper is to discuss the geometric structure of FORMULA 
including a complete integrability of the Pfaff lattice.

Outline of the paper
The paper is organized as follow:
In Section , we discuss the integrability of the Pfaff lattice.
While the Chevalley invariants
FORMULA 
are Hamiltonians of
the lattice, they do not provide enough integrals. We show
that the additional integrals are given by the
generating function
FORMULA 
Note that FORMULA , which generates integrals equivalent to the FORMULA .
In addition we note that FORMULA  is FORMULA -invariant, i.e. FORMULA  for FORMULA .
We follow the method of
{{cite:2dae3d9b-d700-48e7-929e-3f22b72f7928}} to construct the Casimirs and action-angle variables,
with action given by the integrals generated by FORMULA .
We then define an extended Jacobian associated with the spectral curve
FORMULA  which has the genus FORMULA . The extended Jacobian is
given by the Abel-Jacobi map of a vector for which FORMULA  entries are
holomorphic one-forms on FORMULA  and FORMULA  entries are meromorphic
one-forms on FORMULA 
(it is the presence of meromorphic one forms that makes this Jacobian
extended).
This integrability result
is parallel to that of {{cite:2dae3d9b-d700-48e7-929e-3f22b72f7928}} in the sense that
the spectral curve FORMULA  gives the actions (and Casimirs),
while an extended Jacobian on the spectral curve gives
the angles. A fundamental difference in the case of the Pfaff lattice is that
the spectral curve FORMULA  is singular (Proposition REF ).
The singularities provide FORMULA  functional relations among the coefficients in FORMULA .
We then prove that the Pfaff lattice is a complete integrable
Hamiltonian system, with FORMULA  Hamiltonians and FORMULA  Casimirs,
in the sense of Liouville-Arnold (Theorem REF ).
In Section , we review the construction of solutions
to the Pfaff lattice by SR-factorization of FORMULA .
The SR-factorization decomposes FORMULA  where
FORMULA  and FORMULA . A dense set of matrices in FORMULA  possess such a factorization {{cite:61d06d8c-22e5-47ac-8080-a05241124597}}.
Solutions to the Pfaff lattice are then given by FORMULA .
The SR-factorization leads to a Cholesky-type factorization (skew Borel decomposition) of the skew
symmetric moment matrix FORMULA .
With the embedding FORMULA  the Pfaff flow is linear on the space of
skew symmetric matrices. We then define the FORMULA -function as the
Pfaffian of the FORMULA  principal part of FORMULA , and the set FORMULA  generates the
solutions of the Pfaff lattice. We will conclude this section by working out
expressions for the moment matrix and FORMULA -functions which
correspond to discrete measure versions of the GOE and GSE random
matrix models. While the GOE model is a generic case of the Pfaff lattice,
the GSE model corresponds to a degenerate case of the Pfaff lattice with doubly
degenerate eigenvalues.
In Section  we consider generic solutions of the real Pfaff lattice.
In particular, we compute the fixed points of the
Pfaff lattice flow. These are given in the standard way by computing
the asymptotic limits as FORMULA .
The result is a sorting property
similar to that found for the asymptotic limits of the Toda lattice
hierarchy. In our case the matrix converges to a FORMULA  block
diagonal structure which sorts the eigenvalues by pairs from smallest
pair to largest pair as FORMULA  and largest to smallest for
FORMULA  (Theorem REF ).
We then derive the explicit form of the fixed points of the Pfaff
lattice (Theorem REF ).
The total number of fixed points is shown to be FORMULA , which is
the order of the quotient FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the parabolic
subgroup of the symmetric group FORMULA  associated with FORMULA . In the case of the GSE-Pfaff lattice, the number of fixed
points is given by FORMULA , the order of FORMULA .
We conclude this paper, in Section , by constructing the moment polytope to
characterizes the isospectral variety of the Pfaff lattice.
We first note that the FORMULA  can be considered as a point in
FORMULA . We then define the moment map FORMULA  and consider the moment polytope as the
image of the moment map to describe in detail the geometry of
the isospectral variety. We show that in the generic case, the image of the moment map
is a convex polytope described by the irreducible representation of
FORMULA  on the product FORMULA .
The vertices of the polytope
correspond to the fixed points of the Pfaff lattice flow, and an open dense subset of the polytope
is given by the generic orbits of the flow (Theorem REF ). The boundaries of
the polytope consist of the nongeneric orbits of the Pfaff lattice
which include the solutions of the KP equation.
In the case of the GSE-Pfaff lattice, the moment polytope is given by the permutahedron
of the symmetric group FORMULA , that is, the weight polytope associated to the full flag manifold
of FORMULA  (Theorem REF ). This situation is similar to the case of the Toda lattice (see {{cite:5f784c8a-1efa-489e-8afd-f706034fc615}},
{{cite:63e2920d-f684-4ba7-ba4f-e0329df99035}}).

Integrability
In this section, we prove that the Pfaff lattice hierarchy (REF )
is a completely integrable
Hamiltonian system.
Deift, Li, and Tomei {{cite:2dae3d9b-d700-48e7-929e-3f22b72f7928}}
consider the case of the generalized Toda lattice, given by the
Lie algebra splitting FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the Borel subalgebra
of lower triangular matrices with zero trace, and FORMULA 
is the set of skew symmetric matrices. They
showed the Liouville-Arnold integrability of the Toda lattice by
finding the full family of Casimirs and action integrals, and the
conjugate angles. While some of the integrals were found by
considering the chops (as in the case of the full Kostant-Toda lattice
{{cite:bbdcaa11-ada3-4558-a563-347c6dd28047}}), Deift, Li, and Tomei also introduced the
spectral curve
FORMULA 
for the Lax matrix FORMULA , which is invariant under
the FORMULA -adjoint action, i.e. FORMULA  with FORMULA .
The coefficients of this homogeneous polynomial give the additional
Hamiltonians and Casimirs needed to find integrability. In addition,
the angles conjugate to the actions
are a section of an extended Jacobian of this
spectral curve.
Our proof of integrability for the Pfaff lattice equations closely follows
that in {{cite:2dae3d9b-d700-48e7-929e-3f22b72f7928}}, but with several unique structures.
The main complications arise
from the presence of FORMULA  nodal singular points on the
spectral curve.
The integrals  FORMULA
Let us consider the following function,
FORMULA 
which defines an algebraic curve on FORMULA  with the homogeneous coordinates
FORMULA . We denote the curve as
FORMULA 
Note that the function FORMULA  is FORMULA -invariant,
FORMULA 
which also implies FORMULA  for any FORMULA .
Since FORMULA  is invariant under the involution FORMULA , FORMULA  can be expanded in the form,
FORMULA 
Here the functions FORMULA  are homogeneous polynomials of FORMULA  of degree FORMULA  and
are invariant under the involution. They are defined by
FORMULA 
Then because FORMULA  is FORMULA -invariant, the
coefficients FORMULA  provide the integrals of the Pfaff lattice.
The total number of FORMULA  is FORMULA  (note FORMULA 
and FORMULA  are not counted).
In particular, the functions FORMULA  are equivalent to
the Chevalley invariants which are symmetric polynomials of
the eigenvalues of FORMULA , i.e. FORMULA .
Other invariants FORMULA  with FORMULA  provide a foliation of the isospectral variety FORMULA  of (REF ), which will be further discussed in Section REF . To determine a complete
picture of the foliation, one needs to find all the Casimirs which
define the symplectic leaves (symplectic foliation of the Poisson manifold FORMULA ).
In order to find the independent set of the integrals, we first note that the curve (REF ) is
singular at FORMULA :
Proposition 2.1 
The function FORMULA  is reducible, and is given by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  indicates the Pfaffian of a skew-symmetric matrix FORMULA .

Proof. First note that the matrix in the Pfaffian,
FORMULA 
is skew-symmetric.
The determinant of a skew symmetric FORMULA  matrix is
the square of the Pfaffian, this then proves the Proposition.
   
Then from Lemma REF , we have FORMULA  functional relations among FORMULA :
Corollary 2.1 
Each function FORMULA  for FORMULA  can be determined by the
first FORMULA  functions FORMULA  for FORMULA .

Proof. The function FORMULA  has the expansion,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  are defined by FORMULA  if FORMULA 
is even, and FORMULA  if FORMULA  is odd.
From Lemma REF , we have
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  are calculated from the Pfaffian of the matrix FORMULA .
This implies that all FORMULA 's are determined by FORMULA  for FORMULA . Then
the next FORMULA  functions FORMULA  for FORMULA  are expressed by the quadratic
forms of FORMULA 's, that is, FORMULA  with a polynomial
function FORMULA  for FORMULA .
   
Example 2.1  For the case of FORMULA , we have the following two relations,
FORMULA 
For FORMULA , we have three relations:
FORMULA 
For FORMULA , we have four relations,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .

Proposition REF  indicates that the curve FORMULA  has singularities of
FORMULA  double points at FORMULA , and that for generic FORMULA  these are the only singularities,
in which case the genus of FORMULA  is given by the Clebsch formula,
FORMULA 
Let us now find Casimirs for the coadjoint action FORMULA  for FORMULA :
Recall that FORMULA 
factors into an FORMULA -action and a FORMULA -action. We first have:
Proposition 2.2 
The coadjoint orbit generated by FORMULA  of FORMULA  through
FORMULA 
is given by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is defined by the coefficients of FORMULA ,
FORMULA 

Proof. With the Killing form on FORMULA , one can identify FORMULA  with FORMULA . An isomorphism of the identification may be given by
FORMULA 
Also with this identification, the coadjoint orbit FORMULA  is isomorphic to the adjoint orbit FORMULA . Each point FORMULA  on the orbit FORMULA  can be then described by
FORMULA 
which is equivalent to FORMULA . Note here that FORMULA .
   
Thus FORMULA  forms the set of FORMULA -invariant Casimirs, and they are given by
FORMULA 
Remark 2.2 There is a corresponding proposition for the FORMULA -orbit.
In this case the invariants are
generated by FORMULA  where FORMULA 
is the FORMULA 'th lower-left chop of FORMULA ; the matrix found by
deleting the last FORMULA  rows and first FORMULA  columns of FORMULA . The ratio of
the first two coefficients of FORMULA  for FORMULA 
determines the
FORMULA -orbit. However, for FORMULA  lower
Hessenberg, we obtain FORMULA , and FORMULA , so that the FORMULA -invariants are trivial.

Thus we have FORMULA  relations and FORMULA  Casimirs in the set of FORMULA  consisting of FORMULA  functions.
The total number of Hamiltonians for the Pfaff lattice is then given by
FORMULA 
Recall that the FORMULA  has FORMULA  free variables, and there are FORMULA  Casimirs. This means that
the Pfaff lattice (REF ) is a Hamiltonian system of degree FORMULA , and our goal is to
give a complete set of FORMULA  Hamiltonians in involution, and to construct the angle conjugate
to those Hamiltonians (action integrals).
We now discuss the commutativity of the integrals, FORMULA . Let us first note:
Lemma 2.1 
Let FORMULA  be functions on FORMULA .
Suppose FORMULA  is FORMULA -invariant, and FORMULA  is FORMULA -invariant.
Then FORMULA .

Proof. We obtain
FORMULA 

Here the first term is zero by the FORMULA -invariance of FORMULA , and the second
is zero by the FORMULA -invariance of FORMULA .
   
As an immediate consequence of this Lemma,
we have
Corollary 2.2
FORMULA 

Proof. Note just that FORMULA  is both FORMULA - and
FORMULA -invariant, and FORMULA  is FORMULA -invariant.
   
This implies FORMULA  for FORMULA  and FORMULA .
In order to show the commutations FORMULA  for nonzero FORMULA , one needs to compute
the case FORMULA  for nonzero FORMULA . Let us consider the function
for FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
Using FORMULA , we have, by the chain rule,
FORMULA 
where we denote
FORMULA 
and FORMULA .
Now we can prove
Lemma 2.2 
For nonzero values of FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 

Proof. Since FORMULA  is FORMULA -invariant, we have
FORMULA 
We also have the following formula with FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
From (REF ) and FORMULA , we have FORMULA .
   
Corollary REF  and Lemma REF  now lead to
Proposition 2.3 The integrals FORMULA  all commute, i.e. FORMULA  for all FORMULA  and FORMULA .

One can then choose the following set of integrals as the Hamiltonians for the Pfaff lattice:
FORMULA 
The total number of Hamiltonians is FORMULA . In the next section, we construct the angles
conjugate to those Hamiltonians. Then the independence of the Hamiltonians is shown
by that of the angles.

The angle variables conjugate to  FORMULA
Before we define the angle variables conjugate to the integrals FORMULA , we
start with a preliminary Lemma, and introduce several notions on
the curve FORMULA :
Recall the notation FORMULA , i.e. FORMULA .
Lemma 2.3 For generic FORMULA , we have
FORMULA ,
and the kernel is given by any nonzero row of the
cofactor matrix FORMULA .

Proof. For FORMULA ,
we have FORMULA , from which we see
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
If FORMULA  is the zero matrix
then FORMULA , which, for generic FORMULA , only happens at FORMULA .
If the cofactor of a matrix is
non-zero, then the dimension of the kernel of the matrix is less than
or equal to 1. However as the determinant of the FORMULA  is zero
on FORMULA , the
kernel has dimension strictly bigger than zero. Therefore the
dimension of the kernel is 1.
One may then show that if the dimension of the kernel
of a matrix is one, then any non zero row of the cofactor matrix is a
basis for the kernel. This is a straightforward computation using
Cramer's rule.
   
We define the divisor FORMULA  on FORMULA 
such that with the eigenvector map FORMULA ,
with FORMULA ,
the first element of FORMULA  vanishes, denoted as
FORMULA  for FORMULA . In terms of the cofactor
FORMULA , the FORMULA  can be expressed as
FORMULA , where
FORMULA  is the image of FORMULA  under the
involution FORMULA .
For some FORMULA  we denote
FORMULA  (the fiber of FORMULA  over FORMULA ) and
FORMULA  for FORMULA ,
i.e. FORMULA  and FORMULA . Then we consider the dense set of
matrices FORMULA  satisfying
(a)
FORMULA ,
(b)
FORMULA  is a finite set of FORMULA ,
(c)
FORMULA .
(d)
 FORMULA
(e)
FORMULA  for FORMULA ,
(f)
FORMULA  for
FORMULA .
(g)
The only singular points of FORMULA  are at FORMULA .

Here FORMULA . The condition (c) gives the
genericity of the divisor FORMULA .
By the Riemann-Hurwitz theorem, we also note that the degree of
the divisor FORMULA , FORMULA , is given by
FORMULA 
Now we consider a family of differentials on FORMULA  which define the angle variables conjugate to the action integral FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  will be specified later.
By the Riemann-Roch theorem, there exist FORMULA  holomorphic
differentials on the curve FORMULA . As will be shown below, the set of
those differentials consists of
FORMULA  odd differentials and FORMULA  even differentials with respect to the involution
FORMULA . We will use the odd holomorphic
differentials to give the angle variables conjugate to
FORMULA  for FORMULA 
and FORMULA .
For these holomorphic differentials, we use polynomial functions of FORMULA  and FORMULA  for FORMULA ,
and since FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
The angles generated by the odd holomorphic differentials account for
only FORMULA  of the FORMULA  necessary angles.
The remaining FORMULA  angles will be generated by
meromorphic differentials FORMULA  for FORMULA 
with poles at FORMULA .
This meromorphicity at FORMULA ,
together with the involution on FORMULA , explains why we
need condition (d) and FORMULA .
Let us denote the singular locus of FORMULA  by
FORMULA 
and
denote
FORMULA 
Note that FORMULA  is invariant under the coadjoint
action of FORMULA , as the singular points are a feature of the curve FORMULA , while FORMULA  evolves.
Then we consider the integral of FORMULA  from
FORMULA  to FORMULA :
FORMULA 
This defines a map,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the FORMULA -symmetric product of
FORMULA  and FORMULA  associated with the divisor FORMULA  is an extended Jacobian defined below
(see also {{cite:2dae3d9b-d700-48e7-929e-3f22b72f7928}}).
Then we show that FORMULA 
gives the canonical angle conjugate to the integral FORMULA , that is, we determine
FORMULA  so that we have
Proposition 2.4 
For any FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 

The total number of those FORMULA  is FORMULA , and the other FORMULA  angles given in Proposition
REF  below are conjugate to the Chevalley
invariants FORMULA  for FORMULA .
To show Proposition REF , we first note:
Lemma 2.4 Let FORMULA  for FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Then we have
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .

Proof. The commutator can be written as the flow generated by the Hamiltonian FORMULA ,
FORMULA 

Recall that on FORMULA , the eigenvector FORMULA 
for FORMULA 
satisfies FORMULA , i.e. FORMULA .
The evolution of FORMULA  is given by
FORMULA 
Here the generator FORMULA  can be found from the Lax equation FORMULA ,
which is the isospectral condition for FORMULA : Recall that the Pfaff lattice with the Hamiltonian FORMULA  is FORMULA  (see (REF )).
Then we have
FORMULA 

We now compute FORMULA  and FORMULA :
Let us first note by the chain rule,
FORMULA 
Then we have
FORMULA 
which leads to
FORMULA 
We also note from FORMULA  and the same with FORMULA  that FORMULA  can be expressed as
FORMULA 
Substituting (REF ) and (REF ) into
(REF ), we have the Lax equation
FORMULA 
with
FORMULA 
Now from (REF ) and FORMULA  for each FORMULA , we have FORMULA  which
leads to
FORMULA 
Since FORMULA  is a lower triangular matrix, FORMULA . Then the RHS of (REF ) becomes
FORMULA 
Recall that FORMULA  for FORMULA . Also we have that FORMULA  and FORMULA  for FORMULA .
Then using the residue theorem, equation (REF ) can be written by
FORMULA 
Again by the residue theorem, we finally obtain
FORMULA 
which is (REF ).
   
We now prove Proposition REF :
Proof. With (REF ), we choose the following polynomials for FORMULA :
For the case FORMULA , we choose,
FORMULA 
Then we have
FORMULA 
For the case FORMULA , we choose
FORMULA 
which gives
FORMULA 
On the other hand, using (REF ) for FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
Comparing this to (REF ) and (REF ), we get the results of Proposition REF .
Notice that FORMULA  is not a Hamiltonian in our list, hence the presence of the FORMULA 
term in (REF ) does not affect the statement of the Proposition.
   
Remark 2.3 The function FORMULA  is indeed a polynomial and when inserted
into (REF ) gives FORMULA  a holomorphic one form for
FORMULA  and FORMULA .

In order to find the angles FORMULA  conjugate to FORMULA , we
consider the following integral of the meromorphic differentials FORMULA  with a pole at FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are polynomials and FORMULA .
Then one can show:
Proposition 2.5 
For FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 

Proof. As in the previous case, we compute
FORMULA  with FORMULA  for FORMULA .
Then following the previous calculation, we obtain
FORMULA 

Now we choose the following FORMULA  and FORMULA :
For FORMULA , we choose
FORMULA 
Then we have
FORMULA 
For FORMULA , we find that the polynomials
FORMULA 
give
FORMULA 
Now comparing (REF ) for FORMULA , we obtain the desired results as in the previous case.
   
Propositions REF  and REF  provide a proof of the main theorem in this section:
Theorem 2.4 
The Pfaff lattice (REF ) with FORMULA 
is a completely integrable Hamiltonian system with
FORMULA  Hamiltonians given in (REF ) and FORMULA  Casimir functions of (REF ).


Extended Jacobian
Here we just mention that the Pfaff flows are linearized on the extended Jacobian
defined below.
First recall that the curve FORMULA  has the genus FORMULA  (recall (REF )),
and the positive divisor FORMULA  has degree FORMULA .
There are FORMULA  number of holomorphic differentials (the Riemann-Roch theorem).
We have FORMULA  differentials FORMULA  defined in (REF ) for FORMULA  and FORMULA , which are odd forms with respect to the involution FORMULA .
In addition to those, we have other FORMULA  holomorphic differentials FORMULA 
which are even forms defined
as follows: For FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
which are just FORMULA , and
the total number of these is FORMULA . For FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
which give FORMULA  differentials.
Then we have an extended Jacobian FORMULA  associated with the divisor FORMULA  whose dimension is FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
Note here that the differentials FORMULA  also include the
meromorphic one forms
defined for FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Remark 2.5 Since the FORMULA  in (REF ) are even with respect to the involution FORMULA , they are constant under the
flows of every Hamiltonian FORMULA .

Then the commutation relations in Propositions REF  and REF  mean that the flows of the Pfaff hierarchy are linear on the Jacobian.
The extended Jacobian FORMULA  of genus FORMULA  is well defined up to the choice of paths in the
integrals in (REF ); the path of integration may be deformed by an
element of the
homology FORMULA .
Choose a basis of FORMULA  in the following way: Let FORMULA  be a canonical basis for FORMULA  with intersection product FORMULA 
and let FORMULA  be (homologically trivial)
cycles about the points FORMULA  with a positive orientation,
where the FORMULA  are the eigenvalues of FORMULA .
Then the Jacobian map
(REF ) is well defined up to the lattice FORMULA 
generated by the columns
of the FORMULA  period matrix
FORMULA 
where the rows of FORMULA  correspond to the differential forms,
and the columns of FORMULA  correspond to the cycles.
FORMULA  is the FORMULA 
period matrix of the holomorphic one forms with respect to the canonical basis FORMULA .
FORMULA  is the FORMULA  matrix of periods of the meromorphic one
forms FORMULA  over the FORMULA . While FORMULA  is the FORMULA 
matrix where the entry
FORMULA 
is the residue of FORMULA  at FORMULA  for
FORMULA , and the entry
FORMULA 
is the residue of FORMULA  at FORMULA  for FORMULA .
Note that FORMULA , where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are diagonal
matrices, and FORMULA  is a FORMULA  Vandermonde matrix with the entries
FORMULA  for FORMULA  and FORMULA .
The residue theorem and a standard Vandermonde argument imply that
FORMULA .
Therefore the rank of FORMULA  is FORMULA .
As a real
space, FORMULA  has FORMULA  compact dimensions and
FORMULA  noncompact dimensions.
If the eigenvalues FORMULA  are all real, then the entries of FORMULA  are
pure imaginary. One then checks that FORMULA  so that FORMULA 
evolves only in the real direction. Therefore as FORMULA  has imaginary
entries and full rank, and FORMULA 
generates a rank FORMULA  lattice, the evolution of FORMULA  is
entirely in a copy of FORMULA  rather than FORMULA .
This implies that the Chevalley flow induces a noncompact torus
action.
FIGURE 
Numerical calculations with FORMULA  and 3 show that the divisor
FORMULA 
contains some of the points FORMULA , as
FORMULA  (see Figure REF ).
One then notes that the meromorphic one-forms used to produce the angles
FORMULA  conjugate to FORMULA  posses poles at FORMULA .
The FORMULA  noncompact dimensions of the Jacobian produce the
fixed points of the noncompact torus actions generated by the Pfaff lattice hierarchy.
One can construct the solutions of the Pfaff lattice using the Riemann theta function through the Jacobi inversion problem.
However we will not do this here. Instead we use the matrix factorization to construct the solutions in
the next section, and will describe the (real) isospectral variety using
the moment map for the noncompact torus actions in Section .

Matrix factorization and the FORMULA -functions
In this section we derive the solutions of the Pfaff lattice hierarchy
in terms of the SR-factorization of a matrix in FORMULA . We define the
FORMULA -functions whose derivatives generate solutions. In Section
 we use the FORMULA -functions to compute the
fixed points of the Pfaff lattice by computing asymptotics as FORMULA . We conclude
this section by examining the FORMULA -functions in the
GOE and GSE-Pfaff lattices.
As in the case of the Toda lattice, we consider the following matrix factorization for
FORMULA  with the initial Lax matrix FORMULA 
and FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA .
The groups FORMULA  and FORMULA  are defined by
FORMULA 
This factorization is called the SR factorization (a symplectic version of the QR factorization),
and the set of matrices having an SR factorization is dense in FORMULA ,
but not in FORMULA  (Theorems 3.7 and 3.8 in {{cite:61d06d8c-22e5-47ac-8080-a05241124597}}).
A standard computation starting from (REF )
shows that the matrices FORMULA  and FORMULA  satisfy
FORMULA 
and FORMULA , the identity matrix.
The evolution of the Pfaff matrix FORMULA  is then given by
FORMULA 
One should note that the factorization (REF ) is not always possible,
and in general, for some FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
with the symmetric group FORMULA . For example, consider the case FORMULA ,
the companion matrix (REF ) with FORMULA , and set
FORMULA , which then gives
FORMULA 
A factorization of this matrix is given by
FORMULA 
Here FORMULA  is the permutation FORMULA . Note that there are other choices of
FORMULA , for which FORMULA  has other SR-factorizations.
The factorization FORMULA  with
FORMULA  corresponds to a singular solution of the Pfaff lattice, and will be discussed in
a separate publication (see {{cite:5f784c8a-1efa-489e-8afd-f706034fc615}} for the case of the Toda lattice where the factorization is given by the Bruhat decomposition).
Moment matrix and the FORMULA -functions
Let us define a FORMULA  skew-symmetric matrix
FORMULA 
which we call the moment matrix of the Pfaff lattice of (REF ).
This Cholesky-type (or skew Borel) decomposition (REF ) represents the Gauss elimination of a skew symmetric matrix FORMULA . Again one should note that in general the decomposition has the form,
for some FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
In the above example (REF ) , the moment matrix has the form,
FORMULA 
(In this paper, we leave blank the lower triangular part of skew-symmetric matrix.)
Notice that the element FORMULA , and this is the reason why one needs
a permutation FORMULA 
to have the decomposition, FORMULA  with FORMULA .
Let us normalize FORMULA  by a block diagonal matrix FORMULA  with
FORMULA  and FORMULA  so that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is a FORMULA  block lower triangular matrix.
This corresponds to the group factorization, FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the set of diagonal matrices of the form of FORMULA  and FORMULA  is the set of matrices of the form of FORMULA . The FORMULA  is a unipotent subgroup of FORMULA , and can be identified as
the top cell (open dense subset) of the flag variety FORMULA  where FORMULA  is
the parabolic subgroup of FORMULA  block upper triangular matrices.
This implies that the canonical morphism FORMULA  gives an open immersion for the restriction of FORMULA  on FORMULA , i.e.
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the top cell of the flag FORMULA .
With the definition of FORMULA , i.e. FORMULA , we have
Lemma 3.1 
The matrix FORMULA  satisfies
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is a FORMULA  block lower triangular matrix given by
FORMULA 
Also the matrix FORMULA  satisfies
FORMULA 

Proof. From (REF ), we have
FORMULA 
Since FORMULA  and FORMULA , calculating the projection FORMULA  the statement follows.
   
The elements FORMULA  in FORMULA  can be calculated from the Pfaffians of the matrix FORMULA :
Let FORMULA  be the FORMULA  principal part of FORMULA , the FORMULA  upper-left block of FORMULA .
We then define the FORMULA -function FORMULA  as the Pfaffian of FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .
The explicit form of the Pfaffian of a matrix
in (REF ) is given in (REF ).
We wish to describe the fixed points of the Pfaff lattice by computing
the limits of the flow as FORMULA ; however for the Pfaff
variable FORMULA  the flows are unbounded in those
limits (the Chevalley flows correspond to non-compact torus
actions on the extended Jacobian, see
Section REF ). We then normalize these flows
by conjugating FORMULA  by FORMULA : define FORMULA  as
FORMULA 
from which the elements FORMULA  in the super diagonal of FORMULA  are given by
FORMULA 
All other entries of FORMULA  can also be described by the set of FORMULA 
functions as will be
shown in Section  (see also {{cite:ccd3e18c-ba85-446a-9734-ae086cabd2f1}}). In this paper, we consider the case where FORMULA  are nonzero,
and we normalize FORMULA  by a conjugation so that the elements on the super diagonal are all 1.
A Pfaff lattice having FORMULA  for some FORMULA  splits into smaller lattices (sub-systems) which
appear as the boundaries of the isospectral variety of the generic flow. We then define the isospectral variety
of the normalized Pfaff lattice with matrix variable FORMULA  as
FORMULA 
Now the asymptotic matrices of FORMULA  as FORMULA  are
bounded, lie in FORMULA , and
are fixed points of the Pfaff lattice.
Remark 3.1 
In the case of tridiagonal symmetric Toda lattice, the symmetric moment matrix and FORMULA -functions are
defined as follows: Let FORMULA  be an FORMULA  Lax matrix for the Toda lattice
of FORMULA . We have the QR
factorization,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the Borel subgroup of upper triangular matrices.
The (symmetric) moment matrix FORMULA  is then defined by
the Cholesky factorization,
FORMULA 
The FORMULA -functions are defined by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the FORMULA  upper left submatrix of the FORMULA  matrix.
We also obtain similar formulae to (REF ) for the off diagonal elements in FORMULA  matrix,
which are also denoted as FORMULA  (see e.g. {{cite:9333ce83-0ea2-4ba4-a607-c622f13b5896}}).

We note that FORMULA  can be parametrized by
a constant skew-symmetric matrix determined by
the initial matrix FORMULA , which we call the FORMULA -matrix, as follows:
With the normalization FORMULA  (see above), the elements in the super-diagonal of FORMULA 
are all 1. One can then write an eigenmatrix FORMULA  for FORMULA , in the form
FORMULA  where FORMULA  with
diagFORMULA , and the Vandermonde matrix FORMULA  is given by
FORMULA 
Then we have
FORMULA 

Here the FORMULA -matrix is defined by
FORMULA 
FORMULA diagFORMULA  (i.e. FORMULA  with the eigenvalues FORMULA ), and FORMULA  is given by
the Wronskian matrix of FORMULA  with respect to the FORMULA  variable, i.e.
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  for FORMULA , and FORMULA .
Note also that the matrix FORMULA  satisfies the linear equations,
FORMULA 
where we have used FORMULA  with the companion matrix FORMULA .
Since FORMULA  does not affect the value of FORMULA -functions, it is convenient to define
FORMULA . The FORMULA  then satisfies
FORMULA 
This equation can be considered as a linearization of the Pfaff lattice on the
space of skew symmetric invertible matrices as described in Section . The FORMULA -matrix then gives the initial
point of the flow, hence it determines the symplectic leaves of the foliation with the Hamiltonians,
FORMULA .
We remark here that the Pfaff flow can be linearized on FORMULA  as an image of
the companion embedding, FORMULA , that is, we have
the commuting diagram,
FORMULA 
Here we have used FORMULA  and FORMULA  with
FORMULA .
Note here that the Pfaff flow on FORMULA  satisfies
the same equation as FORMULA  in (REF ).
Now we can express the FORMULA -functions in the form with FORMULA  upper-left block of FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
where the sum is taken over the set FORMULA .
The coefficient FORMULA  is a parity of the permutation, i.e.
FORMULA 
For example, we have
FORMULA 

The FORMULA -functions are also obtained as the exterior products of the bi-vector
FORMULA , i.e.
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the usual inner product on FORMULA .
This indicates that the nonzero FORMULA -functions give the generic orbits of the Pfaff lattice,
that is, those orbits are on the top cell of the homogeneous space FORMULA 
(see Section ).
The entry FORMULA  of the moment matrix FORMULA  is explicitly expressed as
FORMULA 
From this expression, we have
FORMULA 
This, of course, is the same as (REF ), but notice that (REF ) includes
the characteristic polynomial FORMULA .
Then it can be shown that the FORMULA -functions satisfy the Hirota bilinear form {{cite:e2ffb47d-4a31-424f-b294-098d1f180f27}},
FORMULA 
with FORMULA . Here FORMULA  is the Hirota derivative with respect to FORMULA , FORMULA .
Note here that the first equation in (REF ) with FORMULA  is
the usual KP equation, and the FORMULA  for the KP equation is given by
the Wronskian form (for example, see {{cite:96ef92db-3a8b-4864-8aed-42e989e3ce95}}).
One should note in (REF ) that FORMULA  are all generated by FORMULA .
This is similar to the case of Toda lattice where the FORMULA -functions FORMULA 
satisfy
FORMULA 
with FORMULA . From this recursive equation, one can show that FORMULA  are given by the Wronskian (Hankel) determinants,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA . This expression of the FORMULA -function then agrees with (REF ) in Remark REF .
Remark 3.2 The system (REF ) has been proposed as a first member of the DKP hierarchy in {{cite:aad58b0f-bd89-442c-b727-ad2b3e999fd9}}.
In {{cite:e2ffb47d-4a31-424f-b294-098d1f180f27}}, Hirota and Ohta introduced the system as an extension of the KP equation
and called it the coupled KP equation. The system (REF ) was rediscovered as the Pfaff lattice describing the partition function of a skew-symmetric matrix models in {{cite:ed9f30de-b0b4-4433-ba0c-579de7d50fc6}}, {{cite:f6089eae-58ab-4b14-91d5-4c12d266c39c}}, {{cite:691082db-6ab3-4e39-98bc-bf0257a8e397}}.
In particular, Adler et al in {{cite:f6089eae-58ab-4b14-91d5-4c12d266c39c}} discussed the lattice structure of the system
and formulated it as the Pfaff lattice with the connection to the Toda lattice. The system (REF )
was also found as a charged BKP hierarchy describing an orbit of some infinite-dimensional Clifford group action in {{cite:1b1fb67d-1ed8-4ab2-90a0-85547783dbe0}}.


Foliation of the phase space by  FORMULA
The integrals FORMULA  (the Chevalley invariants) define the
isospectral manifolds FORMULA .
We have shown that the FORMULA  embeds into
the space of skew-symmetric invertible matrices. This space is then
foliated by the additional integrals FORMULA  for FORMULA  (found in Section
).
Our point of view is that the FORMULA -matrix of (REF ) gives coordinates on the space of
skew-symmetric matrices.
We can then write the constants FORMULA  in terms of the eigenvalues
FORMULA  and
the FORMULA -matrix: We have
Proposition 3.1
FORMULA 

Proof. Using FORMULA  and FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 

By factoring FORMULA  out and setting FORMULA , this can also be expressed as
FORMULA 

In the last step, we have used FORMULA , FORMULA .
Then noting FORMULA , we obtain the result.
   
We denote FORMULA 
as the Pfaffian of the FORMULA  skew symmetric matrix found by
taking the FORMULA  rows and columns of the FORMULA -matrix, e.g.
FORMULA . We note that FORMULA 
since FORMULA .
Example 3.3 The case of FORMULA : The FORMULA  are expressed as
FORMULA 

with FORMULA  (see Example REF ). Here FORMULA  are the elements of the FORMULA -matrix. Recall that FORMULA  for FORMULA  are
the Chevalley invariants which do not depend on the FORMULA -matrix, and FORMULA , FORMULA 
are the Casimirs. This
gives FORMULA  and in addition we
have FORMULA , where FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA 
are constants. This system of equations is linear in FORMULA ,
FORMULA , and FORMULA . For generic FORMULA , FORMULA ,
FORMULA , and FORMULA  it is a non-singular
system.
The foliation of the isospectral variety FORMULA  is therefore
parametrized by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA  are constants.
Note that as the FORMULA  not all FORMULA 's are zero.
This foliation is related to the cell decomposition of the space of
non-singular skew-symmetric FORMULA  matrices.
The case of FORMULA :
We find for instance that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  means that these elements are skipped in the list.
Our hypothesis is that this formula is true for general FORMULA .

Remark 3.4 One
should compare these results with the formula computed in
{{cite:bbdcaa11-ada3-4558-a563-347c6dd28047}} ((23) in p.197) for the FORMULA -chop integrals of the full Kostant Toda
lattice which are found to be rational
functions of the Plücker coordinates FORMULA  and FORMULA 
with FORMULA  and FORMULA  on the flag manifold FORMULA 
with the Borel subgroup FORMULA .


Examples from the matrix models
The Pfaff lattice was introduced as an integrable lattice whose FORMULA -functions are
the partition functions for the matrix models of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE)
and Gaussian symplectic ensemble (GSE) {{cite:ed9f30de-b0b4-4433-ba0c-579de7d50fc6}}.
The partition function of a random
matrix model is given by the matrix integral,
FORMULA 
with Haar measure FORMULA  on the matrix ensemble FORMULA , and
some potential function FORMULA , e.g. FORMULA .
In the case of GOE, the FORMULA  is given by the set of FORMULA  real symmetric matrices,
and in the case of GSE, FORMULA  is the set of FORMULA  self-dual Hermitian matrices with
quaternionic entries.
The moment matrices for both cases are given by skew-symmetric
matrices and the FORMULA -functions (REF ) are Pfaffians of the
moment matrices {{cite:ed9f30de-b0b4-4433-ba0c-579de7d50fc6}}.
In the following two subsections, we give explicit forms of the moment matrix and the FORMULA -functions for
those models.
The matrix model of GOE
The moment matrix associated to GOE is given by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA , and FORMULA .
For our finite dimensional case, fix the eigenvalues of the FORMULA  of the Pfaff
lattice, FORMULA , set FORMULA  to be FORMULA . Then we have:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .
This is obtained from (REF ) with the choice of FORMULA  for the FORMULA -matrix
(REF ). The FORMULA -functions
are then given by
FORMULA 
One should note that the coefficient of each exponential term in
(REF ) is
positive, and this gives a generic orbit of the Pfaff lattice on the
homogeneous space FORMULA  as will be discussed in Section
.

The matrix model of GSE 
The moment matrix associated to GSE is given by
FORMULA 
with FORMULA .
For the finite dimensional case, we have
FORMULA 
To obtain this from (REF ), we first take FORMULA  and
FORMULA  for all other FORMULA . Then we take the limit FORMULA  giving
doubly degenerate eigenvalues. In the formula, we have relabeled the indices of FORMULA  (i.e. FORMULA  for FORMULA ). Note that the matrix FORMULA  in this case has FORMULA  double eigenvalues.
The FORMULA -functions are then given by
FORMULA 
We emphasize that the form of this FORMULA -function is precisely that of
the partition function of the GSE model.
The fact that the associated eigenvalues appear as doubles is an important
consequence of the self-dual quaternionic structure of the matrices in the
GSE.
One should compare (REF ) with the FORMULA -functions of the Toda lattice of FORMULA 
which are given by
FORMULA 
We then expect that the isospectral variety of the Pfaff lattice for GSE model
has a similar
structure as
that of the Toda lattice, which is that of the permutahedron generated by the
orbit of the symmetric group FORMULA  (see for example {{cite:5f784c8a-1efa-489e-8afd-f706034fc615}}, {{cite:a59faa17-cb3c-465c-af18-1f6e91c88ebb}}).
The isospectral variety for the GSE-Pfaff lattice will be discussed in Section
.

Real solutions
Here we consider generic solutions of the real Pfaff lattice whose initial matrix FORMULA  has
all real and distinct eigenvalues.
We start with a brief summary of the results on the skew-orthogonal polynomials obtained in {{cite:ed9f30de-b0b4-4433-ba0c-579de7d50fc6}}, {{cite:f6089eae-58ab-4b14-91d5-4c12d266c39c}} (in particular, we
need Theorem 3.2 in {{cite:f6089eae-58ab-4b14-91d5-4c12d266c39c}}). The goal of this section is to determine all the fixed points
of the Pfaff lattice and to find the asymptotic behavior of the solutions.
The geometric structure of the solutions will be
discussed in the next section.
Skew-orthogonal polynomials
Let us first recall,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  with FORMULA  and
the matrix FORMULA  is the companion matrix (REF ). Recall also that the elements on
the super diagonal of FORMULA  are normalized to all be 1.
The eigenvector FORMULA  of FORMULA  then defines
skew-orthogonal polynomials as follows:
FORMULA 
with FORMULA . From FORMULA  with FORMULA , each element of FORMULA  is a monic polynomial of
degFORMULA , and they are given by FORMULA , FORMULA  and
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the matrix FORMULA .
We now see that the equation FORMULA  for the moment matrix
gives the skew-orthogonal relation of the polynomials FORMULA : First define the matrix
FORMULA . Then the matrix FORMULA 
satisfies FORMULA , which gives the skew-orthogonal relations,
FORMULA 
and all other cases are zero. Note from FORMULA  that the entries FORMULA  of
FORMULA  give the moments with respect to the measure FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Now solving the skew-orthogonal relation FORMULA , we obtain:
Proposition 4.1 (Theorem 3.1 of {{cite:ed9f30de-b0b4-4433-ba0c-579de7d50fc6}}) The skew-orthogonal polynomials FORMULA  can be
found by
FORMULA 
for FORMULA , with FORMULA  and FORMULA .

To prove this result one notes that these functions FORMULA 
satisfy the orthogonality conditions, FORMULA , and
FORMULA .
The following forms of the skew-orthogonal polynomials are particularly useful:
Proposition 4.2 (Theorem 3.2 in {{cite:f6089eae-58ab-4b14-91d5-4c12d266c39c}}) 
The skew-orthogonal polynomials FORMULA  can be expressed in terms of FORMULA -functions,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .

(A proof of this Proposition is based on the moment equation given in (REF ), and
Lemma REF  below.)
From Proposition REF , we have the explicit form of the entries FORMULA  of FORMULA  in (REF ) in terms of the FORMULA -functions,
FORMULA 
Here FORMULA  denotes FORMULA ,
with FORMULA , and FORMULA  are symmetric functions defined by
FORMULA 
The explicit form of the FORMULA  is given by
FORMULA 
which is the complete homogeneous symmetric function FORMULA  with
FORMULA  (see {{cite:f4dd0b28-99cb-4814-96c9-21e237609597}}),
FORMULA 
With the FORMULA  given in (REF ), we can find FORMULA  in terms of the FORMULA -functions,
FORMULA 
In particular, the FORMULA  block diagonal part of FORMULA  has the form,
FORMULA  with
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
Notice from (REF ) that the diagonal elements of FORMULA  (also for FORMULA  in (REF )) are
given by FORMULA . The formulae
for FORMULA  together with FORMULA  in (REF ) are
similar to the formulae for the dependent variables in the Toda lattice, i.e.
FORMULA 
In particular, the functions FORMULA  determine the diagonal elements of FORMULA , and
provide the basic information about the geometry of the isospectral variety, similar to the
Schur-Horn theorem for the set of symmetric matrices (see Section ).

Fixed points of the Pfaff flows
We now compute the asymptotic values of FORMULA  for the case of FORMULA  whose eigenvalues are
all real and to be ordered as
FORMULA 
In the case of GSE-Pfaff lattice, we take the limit FORMULA .
Let us start with the following Lemma for computing
FORMULA :
Lemma 4.1 
With FORMULA , we have, for FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the elementary symmetric polynomial of degree FORMULA  in FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
(note FORMULA  in FORMULA ).
For FORMULA , we have FORMULA .

Proof. Since FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 

Then from (REF )
we find
FORMULA 

Comparing the coefficients of FORMULA , we obtain the desired formulae.
   
This lemma confirms again that FORMULA .
From this Lemma and the ordering of the FORMULA 's, we have, for FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
Here we introduced the notation FORMULA .
We then have
Theorem 4.1 
In generic case, the FORMULA  approaches the block upper triangular
matrix FORMULA  as FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  is the FORMULA 
matrix defined by
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  and FORMULA .
On the other hand, as FORMULA , the FORMULA  approaches FORMULA  whose FORMULA  block diagonal elements are given by FORMULA  for FORMULA .

Proof. First note from (REF ) that FORMULA  approaches a constant matrix as FORMULA . This implies FORMULA  as FORMULA .
On the other hand, from Lemma REF , we have
FORMULA 
The non zero entries in FORMULA  are given by FORMULA  (see (REF )). With the ordering
of the eigenvalues, i.e. FORMULA , and the genericity, one can see
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  are nonzero constants.
Then from (REF ), we have FORMULA  as FORMULA , therefor
FORMULA . Since
FORMULA  and FORMULA  we conclude that FORMULA .
Since FORMULA  is just a constant matrix,
it only remains to find the limits of FORMULA  as FORMULA .
The FORMULA  is explicitly
given by (REF ), and using (REF ), we can easily compute FORMULA  for FORMULA .
   
Each submatrix FORMULA  in the asymptotic value of FORMULA  has the eigenvalues
FORMULA . This implies that the Pfaff lattice has the sorting property of eigenvalues in
pairs as FORMULA , i.e. FORMULA  as FORMULA 
and FORMULA  as FORMULA . It should be noted that
the order in the pair is free.
We can also show:
Lemma 4.2 
A matrix FORMULA  is a fixed point of the Pfaff lattice,
if and only if
FORMULA  is a block upper triangular
matrix for all FORMULA .

Proof. Let us first note that the Pfaff lattice
equation for FORMULA  is given by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is given in Lemma REF . In particular, we
have FORMULA , and with FORMULA , the second term can be
explicitly expressed as
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the FORMULA  matrix with 1 at FORMULA -entry
and 0 for all others. Then if FORMULA  is block upper triangular, i.e. FORMULA ,
we can compute directly that FORMULA  is
strictly block lower triangular with entries given only by the FORMULA 's. This implies
FORMULA , and therefore FORMULA  which
fixes FORMULA  for all FORMULA . One also notes that if FORMULA  is not
block upper triangular, then FORMULA , therefore the
only possible fixed points are those of block upper triangular shape.
A similar direct calculation gives the
same conclusions for the higher flows with generator FORMULA  for FORMULA .
   
We can also obtain the explicit block upper triangular
form of a fixed point, FORMULA , of the Pfaff flow; we find
that a general fixed point is in a form
similar to that of FORMULA  in Theorem REF :
Theorem 4.2 
Each fixed point of the Pfaff lattice is uniquely parametrized by a set
FORMULA 
Therefore the total number of fixed points is given by FORMULA .
Moreover the fixed point corresponding to this set is expressed by a block upper triangular matrix in FORMULA 
whose block diagonal is given by FORMULA 
with
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA .

Proof. For a block upper triangular matrix
with the eigenvalues FORMULA ,
each FORMULA  matrix in the FORMULA 
block diagonal part has a pair of eigenvalues FORMULA 
with FORMULA , therefore a fixed point of
the Pfaff lattice gives the set above.
Then from the form of FORMULA  in FORMULA , one can construct a unique FORMULA  corresponding to this set: In the first block (the top left FORMULA  submatrix FORMULA ), we have a unique block,
FORMULA 
Now suppose FORMULA  has the above form, then, as FORMULA , FORMULA  has the form
FORMULA 
Since this block has the eigenvalues FORMULA , one finds the unique
FORMULA  and FORMULA . This completes the proof.
   
In the next section, we identify those fixed points as the vertices of the moment polytope
generated by the flows associated with the Chevalley invariants, that is, the torus-fixed points
of the Pfaff lattice.
FIGURE 
Example 4.3 
The case FORMULA  for the GOE-Pfaff lattice: The FORMULA -function is given by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  with the ordering FORMULA .
We have FORMULA  fixed points, and each fixed point corresponds to the exponential
term FORMULA  for FORMULA .
We consider the Pfaff orbit in the space of FORMULA  corresponding to the
Chevalley invariants, FORMULA  for FORMULA ,
that is, we consider (REF ). We consider the asymptotic values of the diagonal
element of FORMULA , i.e.
FORMULA 
If the exponential term FORMULA  in the FORMULA  dominates the others in some region
of FORMULA , then in this region FORMULA  takes the value
FORMULA 
One can then identify each fixed point with the ordered set of pairs FORMULA  as the region where
FORMULA  gives the dominant term. So we expect to have six different regions in FORMULA  space:
Figure REF  plots FORMULA  for the case of FORMULA  in the GOE setting where
FORMULA 
with FORMULA , that is, we have
FORMULA 
In Figure REF , each region with the dominant FORMULA  is marked by FORMULA ,
and the boundaries of the regions are given by the balance of two exponential terms,
e.g. FORMULA  which gives FORMULA . This equation
describes the boundary line between FORMULA  and FORMULA  in the FORMULA -FORMULA  plane
for each fixed FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
This line expresses a line soliton solution of the coupled KP (or DKP) equation,
and Figure REF  illustrates a resonant interaction of 2-soliton solution
(see {{cite:f970294b-ec45-4504-9138-5ae6ec7e6217}}).


The GSE-Pfaff lattice
Recall that the moment matrix for the GSE model was obtained by taking the limits FORMULA ,
and setting FORMULA  for some constants FORMULA  and
FORMULA  for all others. Note here that if FORMULA , then it can be
absorbed into the exponential term FORMULA .
However those constants will be important for the general solutions including
rational solutions of the Pfaff lattice (see below).
We also relabel the eigenvalues FORMULA  as FORMULA  for convenience as in
Section REF .
Then we have
Theorem 4.4 
As FORMULA , the FORMULA  for the GSE-Pfaff lattice approaches the upper triangular
matrix FORMULA , as in Theorem REF , whose block diagonal
elements are now given by
FORMULA 
with FORMULA , and FORMULA .

Proof. In the limit FORMULA , the FORMULA  becomes FORMULA ,
which is just FORMULA  after relabeling the eigenvalues.
   
Notice that the matrix FORMULA  has doubly degenerate eigenvalues
FORMULA . Proposition REF  means that the GSE-Pfaff
lattice flow sorts the double eigenvalues in the same manner that the Toda
lattice flow sorts eigenvalues.
One can also see that there are FORMULA  number of fixed points, and
each fixed point corresponds to the matrix having the permuted double eigenvalues,
FORMULA 
Those points form the vertices of the permutahedron of the orbit of the permutation
group, which is the isospectral manifold of the Toda lattice (see
e.g. {{cite:a59faa17-cb3c-465c-af18-1f6e91c88ebb}}, {{cite:5f784c8a-1efa-489e-8afd-f706034fc615}}, also see Section REF ).
Example 4.5 The GSE-Pfaff lattice with FORMULA : The FORMULA -functions are given by
FORMULA 

where FORMULA  are nonnegative constants, and FORMULA  with FORMULA . Each exponential term
in FORMULA  becomes dominant in a certain region of the FORMULA  space.
Figure REF  plots the functions FORMULA  for FORMULA 
to show the dominant exponentials in the FORMULA -functions. Then
we obtain the fixed points of the Pfaff lattice. For example, the region having
FORMULA  and FORMULA  gives the fixed point
FORMULA  with
FORMULA 
where we have used FORMULA . This fixed point corresponds to the ordered
eigenvalues FORMULA .

FIGURE 
Remark 4.6 The rational solutions of the Pfaff lattice discussed in {{cite:ccd3e18c-ba85-446a-9734-ae086cabd2f1}}
are given by the GOE FORMULA -functions in the nilpotent limit with specialized choices of
the FORMULA -matrix. (By the nilpotent limit, we mean the limit FORMULA  for all FORMULA .): We compute the moment matrix
FORMULA  with
FORMULA  in the nilpotent limit corresponding to FORMULA  (i.e. FORMULA  for all FORMULA ). Choosing an appropriate
FORMULA -matrix so that there exists a limit FORMULA , we have
FORMULA  with
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  are the complete homogeneous symmetric functions defined in
(REF ).
Various choices of FORMULA  are considered in {{cite:ccd3e18c-ba85-446a-9734-ae086cabd2f1}},
some of which contain the Jack polynomials. In particular, if FORMULA  is chosen as
the matrix having only nonzero anti-diagonal elements with FORMULA  for
FORMULA , the Pfaffian FORMULA  then
gives the Jack polynomial FORMULA  for rectangular partitions,
FORMULA  with FORMULA ,
which is a zonal spherical function on FORMULA . It is then interesting to compare this with the case of the nilpotent Toda lattice
of FORMULA  where
the FORMULA -functions are given by the Schur polynomials with rectangular partitions,
i.e. FORMULA  with
FORMULA  for FORMULA  (see {{cite:9333ce83-0ea2-4ba4-a607-c622f13b5896}}).


Geometry of the isospectral variety
Here we discuss the geometric structure of the isospectral variety for the Pfaff lattice using
the moment map defined in {{cite:eb1082d3-f5a2-45df-9c65-0801952b6138}}.
Geometric structure of the FORMULA -functions
Recall that the solution of the Pfaff lattice is given by the matrix factorization, FORMULA 
and FORMULA .
This implies that we have a bijection between
the isospectral variety FORMULA  in (REF ) and the homogeneous space,
FORMULA 
with dimFORMULA . Note that FORMULA  is a symmetric space associated
with the involution FORMULA  on FORMULA  with FORMULA ,
i.e. FORMULA .
Then each point of the Pfaff orbit can be parametrized by a skew-symmetric matrix.
The FORMULA -matrix used in the FORMULA -functions
indeed gives a parametrization of the point of FORMULA . Namely we have
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  with FORMULA . Here the FORMULA  gives an isomorphism when FORMULA  is restricted on
an open dense subset of FORMULA , and FORMULA  is the set of skew-symmetric
matrices with detFORMULA . The FORMULA -matrix then parametrizes an initial point of the Pfaff flow, and the time evolution follows
FORMULA 
Note here that FORMULA  with FORMULA . The Pfaff flow also defines a torus action
on FORMULA , that is, FORMULA .
Each FORMULA -function FORMULA  can be expressed in the following form, which is a Pfaffian
version of the Binet-Cauchy theorem {{cite:30cff781-54b2-4d90-abd8-cfb86af3fbce}}:
Lemma 5.1
FORMULA 
where

 FORMULA  is the determinant of the FORMULA  submatrix of the Wronskian matrix FORMULA  in (REF ), and is given by
FORMULA 

 FORMULA  is the Pfaffian of the FORMULA  skewsymmetric submatrix of the FORMULA -matrix, and is
defined by
FORMULA 


Recall that FORMULA  forms a basis of
FORMULA  for distinct FORMULA , let us further assume that
FORMULA  are all
distinct.
There is a bijection between FORMULA  and the basis
vector FORMULA  of
FORMULA , but this bijection is not a homomorphism of
the FORMULA -product structure on the space FORMULA , this deficiency does not affect our
computation.
The coefficient of the
FORMULA  gives a Pfaffian-Plücker coordinate,
which is written recursively by the expansion formula,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  implies the deletion of FORMULA  from
pfFORMULA , and FORMULA .
For example,
the Pfaffian pfFORMULA  is given by
FORMULA 
One should also note from (REF ) that each element FORMULA  in FORMULA  is invariant under the
scalar multiplication to FORMULA  as is FORMULA  from
(REF ), that is, FORMULA  for any
constant FORMULA . This means that the FORMULA  can be considered as a
point of the projective space FORMULA .
We note here that FORMULA  is not (in general) decomposable in
FORMULA , therefore FORMULA  does not
represent a point in the Grassmannian FORMULA .

Moment polytope
Let us recall that the unipotent subgroup FORMULA  can be identified as
the top cell FORMULA  of the flag variety FORMULA  (see Section REF ).
It is also well-known that there is an embedding of the flag FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
This suggests that FORMULA  can be embedded in this
product space (see (REF )).
On each FORMULA , one can define a moment map,
FORMULA , with
a torus action given by the Pfaff flow FORMULA 
(see {{cite:eb1082d3-f5a2-45df-9c65-0801952b6138}}, {{cite:63e2920d-f684-4ba7-ba4f-e0329df99035}}): By considering FORMULA  to
be a point on FORMULA , we define
the image FORMULA  as follows: For the expression of
FORMULA  in Lemma REF ,
FORMULA 
Here FORMULA  is the dual space of Cartan subalgebra of FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
with the weights FORMULA . The moment map FORMULA  can be extended to the map
over the product space of FORMULA  by
FORMULA 
The moment polytope given by the image of the moment map is expressed by
the wedge product representation with the highest weight (see e.g. {{cite:0b51191e-038c-4b95-ac4f-f0bd6560428e}}),
FORMULA 
This is a tensor product of the basic representations of FORMULA , and it is customary denoted by FORMULA  (see {{cite:0b51191e-038c-4b95-ac4f-f0bd6560428e}}): In general, FORMULA  represents the irreducible representation of FORMULA  with the highest weight FORMULA .
The vertices of the polytope are given by the weights which are parametrized by the set of
numbers FORMULA , i.e.
FORMULA 
with FORMULA , and each number of the set appears exactly twice in FORMULA ,
e.g. FORMULA .
Each vertex of the polytope can be parametrized by a unique element of FORMULA , the set of
minimal representatives of the cosets in,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  are the simple reflections, i.e. FORMULA  for FORMULA .
Note here that FORMULA  and
FORMULA .
For example, for FORMULA  and FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
We also note that the quotient FORMULA  parametrizes the Bruhat decomposition of
FORMULA , i.e. FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is a unipotent subgroup of lower triangular matrices.
From (REF ), one can also see that those vertices are identified with the fixed points
of the Pfaff lattice. The identification is given as follows: For the vertex of FORMULA , assign FORMULA 's so that
FORMULA 
Then the corresponding fixed point is given by the block upper triangular matrix FORMULA  obtained in Theorem REF .
For example, the vertex FORMULA  in the case of FORMULA  corresponds
to the matrix FORMULA  given by
FORMULA 
where we have used FORMULA , and all other entries are zero.
This fixed point can be parametrized by the element FORMULA .
We summarize the result in this section as follows:
Theorem 5.1 
For the generic Pfaff lattice,
the image of the moment map (REF ) is a convex polytope whose vertices
are parametrized by the set FORMULA  of minimal representatives of the
cosets in FORMULA  with
FORMULA . Those vertices are identified as the fixed points of the Pfaff flow given in Theorem REF .

Example 5.2
FIGURE 
In Example REF , we considered the Pfaff lattice for the GOE model in the case of
FORMULA . The momentum polytope associated to this model is given by the irreducible representation
with the highest weight FORMULA , which is an octahedron. In Figure REF , we show the momentum polytope and explain how the polytope can be realized
from the solution of the Pfaff lattice in the space of FORMULA . One should note that the polytope
is just a dual diagram of the pattern of the solution FORMULA  in FORMULA , that is, identify
each region for constant FORMULA  as a vertex of the polytope, and the line between two values of FORMULA 
as an edge of the polytope, and so on. The vertices are parametrized by the elements of FORMULA , i.e.
FORMULA 
The generic orbit can be described by a curve inside of the polytope approaching to
FORMULA  vertex as FORMULA  and to FORMULA  vertex as FORMULA . Those vertices represent
the highest and lowest weights. The edges of the polytope correspond to non-generic orbits
of the Pfaff lattice. For example, the edge between FORMULA  and FORMULA  is a solution
given by the FORMULA  function with the FORMULA -matrix,
FORMULA 
Note that the FORMULA  for this choice of FORMULA -matrix, and the FORMULA  satisfies the KP equation.
The faces of the polytope correspond to non-generic orbits (i.e. KP solutions).
Some explicit solutions are studied in {{cite:f970294b-ec45-4504-9138-5ae6ec7e6217}}.
We then note that a classification of the solutions of the Pfaff lattice can be obtained by
the representations of the FORMULA  orbit in FORMULA .


The moment polytope for the GSE model 
Recall that the FORMULA -functions for the GSE-Pfaff lattice are given by (REF ), i.e.
FORMULA 
where FORMULA . Writing those in the form,
FORMULA 
with
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA . Since FORMULA  represents a coordinate
for FORMULA , the FORMULA  can be considered as
a point in FORMULA  as discussed in the previous section.
Now we consider the moment map FORMULA  where FORMULA  is the dual space of Cartan subalgebra
of FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  are the weights of FORMULA  of FORMULA .
As in the previous case, the moment map FORMULA  can be extended to the product space,
FORMULA 
Then the moment polytope is the permutahedron of FORMULA  (denoted as
FORMULA  of the basic representation
of FORMULA  {{cite:0b51191e-038c-4b95-ac4f-f0bd6560428e}}), which is the weight polytope with
the highest weight,
FORMULA 
Each vertex of the polytope is parametrized by the element of FORMULA . We summarize the result:
Theorem 5.3 
For the GSE-Pfaff lattice, the image of the moment map (REF ) is given by the permutahedron of the symmetric group FORMULA , whose vertices are the fixed points of the
flow.

FIGURE 
Example 5.4 The momentum polytope for FORMULA  GSE model:
In Figure REF , the dominant exponential terms in the FORMULA -functions are plotted
in FORMULA -FORMULA  plane. The combined graph of FORMULA  and FORMULA  divides the FORMULA -FORMULA  plane into 6 regions, each of which
is marked by the number set FORMULA  with FORMULA  or FORMULA  FORMULA  (see Figure REF ).
The dual graph of the combined graph gives a hexagon as shown in
Figure REF , which is the moment polytope for the symmetric group FORMULA .
The edges of the hexagon correspond to non-generic flows, e.g. the edge between the vertices FORMULA 
and FORMULA  corresponds to the flow given by the FORMULA -function with FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
This then gives FORMULA , and the Pfaff lattice is reduced to
the model with FORMULA , i.e. a subsystem of the original lattice.
