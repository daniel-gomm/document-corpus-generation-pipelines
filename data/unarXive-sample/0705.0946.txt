By using only combinatorial data on two posets FORMULA  and FORMULA , we
construct a set of so-called formulas. A formula produces
simultaneously, for any abelian category FORMULA , a functor between the
categories of complexes of diagrams over FORMULA  and FORMULA  with values in
FORMULA . This functor induces a triangulated functor between the
corresponding derived categories.
This allows us to prove, for pairs FORMULA  of posets sharing certain
common underlying combinatorial structure, that for any abelian
category FORMULA , regardless of its nature, the categories of diagrams
over FORMULA  and FORMULA  with values in FORMULA  are derived equivalent.

Introduction
In previous work {{cite:b2c5a0b5-5875-43d5-9914-6c869d5e4d70}} we considered the question when the
categories FORMULA  and FORMULA  of diagrams over finite posets FORMULA  and
FORMULA  with values in the abelian category FORMULA  of finite dimensional
vector spaces over a fixed field FORMULA , are derived equivalent.
Since in that case the category of diagrams FORMULA  is equivalent to
the category of finitely generated modules over the incidence algebra
FORMULA , methods from the theory of derived equivalence of algebras, in
particular tilting theory, could be
used {{cite:fe895448-bd74-47f4-89b2-1d031cb10ff0}}, {{cite:14e08a0c-f82a-4e06-a362-50b67ac66ec6}}, {{cite:9219d436-0c39-4869-9ddd-6626254a5dfc}}.
Interestingly, in all cases considered, the derived equivalence of two
categories of diagrams does not depend on the field FORMULA . A natural
question arises whether there is a general principle which explains
this fact and extends to any arbitrary abelian category FORMULA .
In this paper we provide a positive answer in the following sense; we
exhibit several constructions of pairs of posets FORMULA  and FORMULA  such that
the derived categories FORMULA  and FORMULA  are equivalent for any
abelian category FORMULA , regardless of its nature. Such pairs of posets
are called universally derived equivalent, since the derived
equivalence is universal and originates from the combinatorial and
topological properties of the posets, rather than the specific abelian
categories involved.
Our main tools are the so-called formulas. A formula consists of
combinatorial data that produces simultaneously, for any abelian
category FORMULA , a functor between the categories of complexes of
diagrams over FORMULA  and FORMULA  with values in FORMULA , which induces a
triangulated functor between the corresponding derived categories.
The main construction
Let FORMULA  and FORMULA  be two finite partially ordered sets (posets).
For FORMULA , write FORMULA  and
FORMULA . Let FORMULA 
be a collection of subsets of FORMULA  indexed by the elements of FORMULA , such
that
FORMULA 
for any FORMULA  and FORMULA  in FORMULA . Assume in addition that for
any FORMULA , there exists an isomorphism FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 

By (REF ), it follows that
FORMULA 
Define two partial orders FORMULA  and FORMULA  on the disjoint
union FORMULA  as follows. Inside FORMULA  and FORMULA , the orders
FORMULA  and FORMULA  agree with the original ones, and for FORMULA  and FORMULA  we set
FORMULA 

with no other relations (note that the element FORMULA  is unique
by (REF ), and that FORMULA , FORMULA  are partial
orders by (REF )).
Theorem 1.1 
The two posets FORMULA  and FORMULA 
are universally derived equivalent.

The assumption (REF ) of the Theorem cannot be dropped,
as demonstrated by the following example.
Example 1.2 Consider the two posets whose Hasse diagrams are given by
FORMULA 
They can be represented as FORMULA  and FORMULA  where FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA . The categories of diagrams over these two posets are in
general not derived equivalent, even for diagrams of vector spaces.

The construction of Theorem REF  has many interesting
consequences, some of them related to ordinal sums and others to
generalized BGP reflections {{cite:6a3c3d08-160a-4d04-9974-01a848fd852e}}. First, consider the case
where all the subsets FORMULA  are single points, that is, there exists a
function FORMULA  with FORMULA  for all FORMULA .
Then (REF ) and (REF ) are automatically
satisfied and the condition (REF ) is equivalent to FORMULA  being
order preserving, i.e. FORMULA  for FORMULA . Let
FORMULA  and FORMULA  denote the corresponding orders on FORMULA , and note that (REF ) takes the simplified form
FORMULA 
Corollary 1.3 
Let FORMULA  be order preserving. Then the two posets FORMULA  and FORMULA  are universally derived
equivalent.

FIGURE 
Example 1.4 Consider the four posets FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  whose Hasse
diagrams are drawn in Figure REF . For any of the pairs
FORMULA  where FORMULA , FORMULA  or FORMULA  we find posets FORMULA 
and FORMULA  and an order-preserving function FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 

hence FORMULA  and FORMULA  are universally derived equivalent. Indeed, let
FORMULA 

and define FORMULA , FORMULA 
and FORMULA  by
FORMULA 


Applications to ordinal sums
Recall that the ordinal sum of two posets FORMULA  and
FORMULA , denoted FORMULA , is the poset FORMULA 
where FORMULA  if FORMULA  and FORMULA  or FORMULA  and FORMULA  or FORMULA  and FORMULA . Similarly, the direct sum
FORMULA  is the poset FORMULA  where FORMULA  if FORMULA  and FORMULA  or FORMULA  and FORMULA . Note that the
direct sum is commutative (up to isomorphism) but the ordinal sum is
not. Denote by FORMULA  the poset consisting of one element. Taking FORMULA  in Corollary REF , we get the following
Corollary 1.5 For any poset FORMULA , the posets FORMULA  and FORMULA  are
universally derived equivalent.

Note that for arbitrary two posets FORMULA  and FORMULA , it is true that for any
field FORMULA , the categories of diagrams of finite dimensional FORMULA -vector
spaces over FORMULA  and FORMULA  are derived
equivalent {{cite:b2c5a0b5-5875-43d5-9914-6c869d5e4d70}}. However the proof relies
on the notion of tilting complexes and cannot be directly extended to
arbitrary abelian categories.
In Section REF  we prove the following additional consequence
of Corollary REF  for ordinal and direct sums.
Corollary 1.6 
For any two posets FORMULA  and FORMULA , the posets FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are universally derived equivalent. Hence the
posets FORMULA  and FORMULA  are
universally derived equivalent.

The result of Corollary REF  is no longer true when FORMULA  is
replaced by an arbitrary poset, even for diagrams of vector spaces,
see {{cite:b2c5a0b5-5875-43d5-9914-6c869d5e4d70}}.

Generalized BGP reflections
More consequences of Theorem REF  are obtained by
considering the case where FORMULA  is a single point, that is,
there exists a subset FORMULA  such that (REF )
holds for any FORMULA  in FORMULA . Observe that
conditions (REF ) and (REF ) automatically hold in
this case, and the two partial orders on FORMULA  corresponding
to (REF ), denoted FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
are obtained by extending the order on FORMULA  according to
FORMULA 
Corollary 1.7 
Let FORMULA  be a subset satisfying (REF ). Then
the posets FORMULA  and FORMULA  are universally derived equivalent.

Note that in the Hasse diagram of FORMULA , the vertex FORMULA  is a
source which is connected to the vertices of FORMULA , and the Hasse
diagram of FORMULA  is obtained by reverting the orientations
of the arrows from FORMULA , making it into a sink. Thus
Corollary REF  can be considered as a generalized BGP reflection
principle.
Viewing orientations on (finite) trees as posets by setting FORMULA 
for two vertices FORMULA  if there exists an oriented path from FORMULA  to
FORMULA , and applying a standard combinatorial argument {{cite:6a3c3d08-160a-4d04-9974-01a848fd852e}}, we
recover the following corollary, already known for categories of vector
spaces over a field.
Corollary 1.8 Any two orientations of a tree are universally derived equivalent.


Formulas
By using only combinatorial data on two posets FORMULA  and FORMULA , we
construct a set of formulas FORMULA . A formula FORMULA  produces
simultaneously, for any abelian category FORMULA , a functor
FORMULA  between the categories FORMULA  and FORMULA  of
complexes of diagrams over FORMULA  and FORMULA  with values in FORMULA . This
functor induces a triangulated functor FORMULA 
between the corresponding derived categories FORMULA  and FORMULA 
such that the following diagram is commutative
FORMULA 
where the vertical arrows are the canonical localizations.
We prove Theorem REF  by exhibiting a pair of formulas
FORMULA , FORMULA  and showing that for any abelian category
FORMULA , the compositions FORMULA  and
FORMULA 
of the corresponding triangulated functors on the derived categories
are auto-equivalences, as they are isomorphic to the translations.
Hence FORMULA  and FORMULA  are universally derived equivalent.

Complexes of diagrams
Diagrams and sheaves
Let FORMULA  be a poset and let FORMULA  be a category.
Definition 2.1 A diagram FORMULA  over FORMULA  with values in FORMULA  consists of the
following data:

For any FORMULA , an object FORMULA  of  FORMULA

For any pair FORMULA , a morphism FORMULA 
(restriction map)

subject to the conditions FORMULA  and
FORMULA  for all FORMULA  in FORMULA .
A morphism FORMULA  of diagrams consists of
morphisms FORMULA  for all FORMULA , such that for any FORMULA , the diagram
FORMULA 
commutes.

Using these definitions, we can speak of the category of diagrams over
FORMULA  with values in FORMULA , which will be denoted by FORMULA .
We can view FORMULA  as a small category as follows. Its objects are the
points FORMULA , while FORMULA  is a one-element set if FORMULA  and empty otherwise. Under this viewpoint, a diagram over FORMULA  with
values in FORMULA  becomes a functor FORMULA  and a morphism of
diagrams corresponds to a natural transformation, so that FORMULA  is
naturally identified with the category of functors FORMULA . Observe
that any functor FORMULA  induces a functor FORMULA  by the composition FORMULA . In terms of diagrams
and morphisms, FORMULA  where FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and FORMULA .
If FORMULA  is additive, then FORMULA  is additive. Assume now that FORMULA 
is abelian. In this case, FORMULA  is also abelian, and kernels, images,
and quotients can be computed pointwise, that is, if FORMULA  is a morphism of diagrams then FORMULA , FORMULA , with the restriction maps induced from FORMULA , FORMULA . In
particular, for any FORMULA  the evaluation functor FORMULA  taking a diagram FORMULA  to FORMULA  and a morphism FORMULA  to
FORMULA , is exact.
The poset FORMULA  admits a natural topology, whose open sets are the
subsets FORMULA  with the property that if FORMULA  and FORMULA  then FORMULA . The category of diagrams over FORMULA  with values in
FORMULA  can then be naturally identified with the category of sheaves
over the topological space FORMULA  with values in FORMULA  {{cite:b2c5a0b5-5875-43d5-9914-6c869d5e4d70}}.

Complexes and cones
Let FORMULA  be an additive category. A complex FORMULA  over FORMULA  consists of objects FORMULA  for FORMULA 
with morphisms FORMULA  such that FORMULA  for all FORMULA . If FORMULA , the shift of
FORMULA  by FORMULA , denoted FORMULA , is the complex defined
by FORMULA , FORMULA .
Let FORMULA , FORMULA  be
two complexes and FORMULA  a collection of morphisms FORMULA . If FORMULA , let FORMULA  with
FORMULA . Using this notation, the condition that FORMULA  is a
morphism of complexes is expressed as FORMULA .
The FORMULA  of a morphism FORMULA ,
denoted FORMULA , is the
complex whose FORMULA -th entry equals FORMULA , with the
differential
FORMULA 
In a more compact form, FORMULA  with the differential acting as
the matrix
FORMULA 
by viewing the entries as column vectors.
When FORMULA  is abelian, the FORMULA -th cohomology of FORMULA  is defined by FORMULA , and FORMULA  is acyclic if
FORMULA  for all FORMULA . A morphism FORMULA  induces morphisms FORMULA . FORMULA  is called a quasi-isomorphism if
FORMULA  are isomorphisms for all FORMULA .
The following lemma is standard.
Lemma 2.2 
FORMULA  is a quasi-isomorphism if and only if
the cone FORMULA  is acyclic.

Let FORMULA  denote the category of complexes over FORMULA . Denote by
FORMULA  the shift functor taking a complex
FORMULA  to FORMULA  and a morphism FORMULA  to FORMULA . Any additive functor
FORMULA  induces an additive functor FORMULA  by sending a complex FORMULA  to FORMULA  and a morphism FORMULA  to FORMULA .
Lemma 2.3 
For any additive category FORMULA  and a poset FORMULA , there exists an
equivalence of categories FORMULA 
such that for any additive category FORMULA  and an additive functor FORMULA , the diagram
FORMULA 
commutes. In other words, we can identify a complex of diagrams with a
diagram of complexes.

Let FORMULA  be additive and let FORMULA  be a complex
in FORMULA . Denote by FORMULA  the morphisms in
FORMULA  and by FORMULA  the morphisms on the
stalks. Let FORMULA  denote the restriction maps in
the diagram FORMULA .
For a morphism FORMULA  in FORMULA , denote by FORMULA  the
corresponding morphisms in FORMULA  and by FORMULA  the
morphisms on stalks. Define a functor FORMULA  by
FORMULA 

where FORMULA  with differential FORMULA , FORMULA 
are the restriction maps, and FORMULA .
The commutativity of all squares in the diagram in Figure REF 
implies that FORMULA  is well-defined, induces the required
equivalence and that (REF ) commutes.
FIGURE 
In the sequel, FORMULA  is a poset, FORMULA  is an abelian category and all
complexes are in FORMULA .
Lemma 2.4 
 FORMULA

Kernels and images can be computed pointwise.
Lemma 2.5 
 FORMULA

Corollary 2.6 
Let FORMULA  be a morphism of complexes of
diagrams. Then FORMULA  is a quasi-isomorphism if and only if for every FORMULA , FORMULA  is a quasi-isomorphism.

Let FORMULA  and FORMULA . Then by Lemmas REF 
and REF ,
FORMULA 
hence FORMULA  is acyclic if
and only if FORMULA  are
acyclic for every FORMULA . Using Lemma REF , we see that
FORMULA  is a quasi-isomorphism if and only if all the FORMULA  are
quasi-isomorphisms.

Universal derived equivalence
Recall that the derived category FORMULA  of an abelian category FORMULA 
is obtained by formally inverting all the quasi-isomorphisms in
FORMULA . It admits a structure of a triangulated category where the
distinguished triangles in FORMULA  are those isomorphic to FORMULA  where FORMULA  is a short
exact sequence in FORMULA .
Definition 2.7 Two posets FORMULA  and FORMULA  are universally derived equivalent if for
any abelian category FORMULA , the derived categories FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are equivalent as triangulated categories.

Lemma 2.8 Let FORMULA  and FORMULA  be universally derived equivalent. Then FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are universally derived equivalent.

Lemma 2.9 Let FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA , FORMULA  be two pairs of universally derived
equivalent posets. Then FORMULA  and FORMULA  are
universally derived equivalent.


Formulas
Throughout this section, the poset FORMULA  is fixed.
The category  FORMULA
Viewing FORMULA  as a small category with a unique map FORMULA  if FORMULA  and FORMULA  and no maps otherwise, we can
consider the additive category FORMULA  whose objects are
finite sequences FORMULA  with morphisms
FORMULA  specified by
FORMULA  integer matrices FORMULA  satisfying FORMULA 
unless FORMULA . That is, a morphism is a formal
FORMULA -linear combination of arrows FORMULA .
Addition and composition of morphisms correspond to the usual addition
and multiplication of matrices.
To encode the fact that squares of differentials are zero, we consider
a certain quotient of FORMULA . Namely, let
FORMULA  be the ideal in FORMULA  generated by
all the morphisms FORMULA  for FORMULA  and
let FORMULA  be the quotient.
The objects of FORMULA  are still sequences FORMULA  and the
morphisms can again be written as integer matrices, albeit not uniquely
as we ignore the entries FORMULA  whenever FORMULA .
Define a translation functor FORMULA  as follows. For an
object FORMULA , let FORMULA . For a morphism FORMULA , let FORMULA  be the morphism
FORMULA  specified by the same matrix
FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be an abelian category. From now on we shall denote a complex
in FORMULA  by FORMULA  instead of FORMULA , and use
Lemma REF  to identify FORMULA  with FORMULA . Therefore we
may think of FORMULA  as a diagram of complexes in FORMULA  and use the
notations FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  as in the proof of that lemma.
For two additive categories FORMULA  and FORMULA , let FORMULA 
denote the category of additive functors FORMULA , with natural
transformations as morphisms.
Proposition 3.1 
There exists a functor FORMULA 
commuting with the translations.

An object FORMULA  defines an additive functor
FORMULA  from FORMULA  to FORMULA  by sending FORMULA  and a
morphism FORMULA  to
FORMULA 

where the right term is the FORMULA  diagonal matrix whose FORMULA 
entry is FORMULA .
To define FORMULA  on morphisms FORMULA , consider first the case
that FORMULA  and FORMULA . A morphism FORMULA  in FORMULA  is specified by an integer FORMULA , with FORMULA 
unless FORMULA . Given FORMULA , define a morphism
FORMULA  by
FORMULA 
Then FORMULA  is a natural transformation since
the diagrams
FORMULA 

commute.
Let FORMULA  be another morphism in
FORMULA . Then (REF ) and the three relations FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA , imply that
FORMULA 
for every FORMULA .
Now for a general morphism FORMULA , define morphisms FORMULA  by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is defined by (REF ) for FORMULA .
It follows from (REF ) by linearity that for FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
so that FORMULA  is a natural
transformation. Linearity also shows that (REF ) holds for
general morphisms FORMULA , FORMULA .
Finally, note that by (REF ) and (REF ),
FORMULA 

for any object FORMULA  and morphism FORMULA .

Formula to a point
So far the differentials on the complexes FORMULA  were just the
direct sums FORMULA . For the applications,
more general differentials are needed.
Let FORMULA  be a morphism. Define
FORMULA  by FORMULA 
where FORMULA .
Lemma 3.2 
Let FORMULA  be a morphism and assume that FORMULA  in FORMULA . Then for any FORMULA , FORMULA  is
a differential on FORMULA .

Since FORMULA , the morphism FORMULA  induces a map
FORMULA . Thinking of FORMULA  as
a potential differential, observe that
FORMULA 
Indeed, each component FORMULA  of FORMULA  is
obtained from FORMULA  by a change of sign. When FORMULA ,
changing the sign of a map FORMULA  leads to the map
FORMULA . When FORMULA , changing the sign of
FORMULA  leads to FORMULA , as the sign
change is already carried out in the shift of the differential
FORMULA . Therefore in both cases a the coefficient FORMULA  of FORMULA  changes to FORMULA .
Now the claim follows from
FORMULA 
Definition 3.3 A morphism FORMULA  is a differential
if FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA . FORMULA  is a restriction if
FORMULA  and FORMULA .
A morphism FORMULA  is a restriction if all its
nonzero components are restrictions.

Definition 3.4 A formula to a point is a pair FORMULA  where
FORMULA  is an object of FORMULA  and FORMULA  is morphism satisfying:

FORMULA .

FORMULA  for all FORMULA .

FORMULA  are differentials for all FORMULA .

A morphism of formulas to a point FORMULA  is a morphism FORMULA  in FORMULA  which is a
restriction and satisfies FORMULA .

Denote by FORMULA  the category of formulas to a point and their
morphisms. The translation FORMULA  of FORMULA  induces a translation FORMULA 
on FORMULA  by FORMULA  with the same action on
morphisms.
Proposition 3.5 
There exists a functor FORMULA .

We actually show that the required functor is induced from the functor
FORMULA  of Proposition REF .
An object FORMULA  defines an additive functor FORMULA  by sending FORMULA  and FORMULA  to
FORMULA 

as in (REF ). By Lemma REF , FORMULA  is a
differential on FORMULA .
Now observe that FORMULA 
since FORMULA  is a natural transformation.
Therefore FORMULA  is a morphism of complexes and FORMULA  is a
functor.
Let FORMULA  be a morphism in FORMULA . Since
FORMULA  in FORMULA , we have a natural transformation
FORMULA . It remains to show that
FORMULA  is a morphism of complexes. But the commutativity
with the differentials FORMULA  and FORMULA  follows from
FORMULA  and the functoriality of FORMULA .
Example 3.6 (Zero dimensional chain)  
Let FORMULA  and consider FORMULA  with FORMULA . The functor
FORMULA  sends FORMULA  to the stalk FORMULA  and FORMULA  to
FORMULA .

Example 3.7 (One dimensional chain)  
Let FORMULA  in FORMULA  and consider FORMULA  with the map FORMULA . Then for FORMULA 
and FORMULA ,
FORMULA 

with the differential
FORMULA 
Since for any object FORMULA , FORMULA  as complexes, we see that for any FORMULA ,
the cone FORMULA  defines a functor
FORMULA .

Lemma 3.8 
There exists a natural isomorphism FORMULA .

We first remark that for an object FORMULA , a morphism
FORMULA  and FORMULA , FORMULA 
and FORMULA  so that FORMULA  can be viewed as first applying the shift on FORMULA 
and then applying FORMULA .
We will construct natural isomorphisms of functors FORMULA  such that the
diagrams
FORMULA 
commute for all FORMULA .
By (REF ), FORMULA . Write FORMULA ,
FORMULA , and let FORMULA  be the morphism
defined by the diagonal matrix whose FORMULA  entry is FORMULA . By
definition, FORMULA , or equivalently
FORMULA  for all FORMULA , hence
FORMULA . Therefore FORMULA  is an isomorphism in FORMULA , so we
define FORMULA .
For the commutativity of (REF ), first observe that FORMULA . Now use
the fact that FORMULA  for any restriction
FORMULA .
In the next few lemmas, we fix a formula to a point FORMULA .
Lemma 3.9 
FORMULA  maps short exact sequences to short exact sequences.

Write FORMULA  and let FORMULA  be a short exact sequence. Then FORMULA  is exact
for any FORMULA , hence
FORMULA 
is exact.
By composing with the equivalence FORMULA , we
may view FORMULA  as a functor FORMULA  between two
categories of complexes.
Lemma 3.10 
FORMULA  maps quasi-isomorphisms to quasi-isomorphisms.

Write FORMULA . We prove the claim by induction on
FORMULA . When FORMULA , we have FORMULA , FORMULA  and
FORMULA , so that the claim follows from
Corollary REF .
Assume now that FORMULA , and let FORMULA  and
FORMULA  be the corresponding restricted matrix. By
the assumption that FORMULA  is lower triangular with ones on the
main diagonal, we have that the canonical embedding FORMULA  and the projection
FORMULA  commute with the differentials, hence there exists a
functorial short exact sequence
FORMULA 
Let FORMULA  be a morphism. The functoriality of (REF )
gives rise to the following diagram of long exact sequences in
cohomology,
FORMULA 
Now assume that FORMULA  is a quasi-isomorphism. By the induction
hypothesis, FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are
quasi-isomorphisms, hence by the Five Lemma, FORMULA  is also a
quasi-isomorphism.
Corollary 3.11 Let FORMULA  be a formula to a point. Then FORMULA  induces a
triangulated functor FORMULA .


General formulas
Definition 3.12 Let FORMULA  be a poset. A formula from FORMULA  to  FORMULA is a diagram over
FORMULA  with values in FORMULA .

Proposition 3.13 There exists a functor FORMULA .

Let FORMULA  be the functor of
Proposition REF . Then
FORMULA 
is the required functor.
Let FORMULA  be a formula.
Lemma 3.14 FORMULA  maps short exact sequences to short exact sequences.

It is enough to consider each component of FORMULA  separately.
The claim now follows from Lemma REF .
By composing from the left with the equivalence FORMULA  and from the right with FORMULA 
we may view FORMULA  as a functor FORMULA 
between two categories of complexes.
Lemma 3.15 FORMULA  maps quasi-isomorphisms to quasi-isomorphisms.

Let FORMULA  be a quasi-isomorphism. By Corollary REF , it
is enough to show that each component of FORMULA  is a
quasi-isomorphism in FORMULA . But this follows from
Lemma REF .
Corollary 3.16 Let FORMULA  be a formula. Then FORMULA  induces a
triangulated functor FORMULA .


Applications of formulas
The chain with two elements
As a first application we consider the case where the poset FORMULA  is a
chain of two elements
FORMULA 
We focus on this simple case as the fundamental underlying principle of
Theorem REF  can already be effectively demonstrated in that
case.
Let FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  be the
following three formulas to a point in FORMULA .
FORMULA 
Let FORMULA  be an abelian category and FORMULA 
be an object of FORMULA . In the more
familiar notation,
FORMULA 

see Examples REF  and REF .
The morphisms
FORMULA 

are restrictions that satisfy FORMULA  and
FORMULA , hence
FORMULA 

are diagrams over FORMULA  with values in FORMULA , thus they
define functors FORMULA 
inducing triangulated functors FORMULA . Their values on objects FORMULA  are
FORMULA 
Proposition 4.1 
There are natural transformations
FORMULA 
such that FORMULA , FORMULA  are quasi-isomorphisms for all
FORMULA .

The functors FORMULA  and FORMULA  correspond to
the compositions FORMULA  and FORMULA , given by
FORMULA 

where
FORMULA 

and the translation FORMULA  corresponds to the diagram
FORMULA 
Let FORMULA  be the morphisms
FORMULA 

The following diagram in  FORMULA
FORMULA 
is commutative, hence the horizontal arrows induce morphisms of
formulas FORMULA  and FORMULA , inducing natural transformations FORMULA  and FORMULA .
We prove that FORMULA  and FORMULA  are quasi-isomorphisms
for all FORMULA  by showing that each component is a quasi-isomorphism (see
Corollary REF ). Indeed, let FORMULA  and FORMULA  be the maps
FORMULA 
Then
FORMULA 

where FORMULA  is the FORMULA  identity matrix, hence FORMULA  and FORMULA  induce the identities and FORMULA , FORMULA  induce morphisms FORMULA  and FORMULA  homotopic to the
identities. Therefore FORMULA , FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and FORMULA  are quasi-isomorphisms.
Proposition 4.2 There are natural transformations
FORMULA 

such that FORMULA , FORMULA  are quasi-isomorphisms for all
FORMULA .

The functors FORMULA  and FORMULA  correspond to
the compositions FORMULA  and FORMULA , given by
FORMULA 

where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are as
in (REF ). The commutative diagrams
FORMULA 

where FORMULA  are as in (REF ), define
morphisms of formulas FORMULA  and
FORMULA , hence natural transformations
FORMULA  and FORMULA . Using the homotopies (REF ), one proves that
FORMULA  and FORMULA  are quasi-isomorphisms for all FORMULA  in
the same way as before.
Corollary 4.3 For any abelian category FORMULA , the functors FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are auto-equivalences of FORMULA 
satisfying
FORMULA 

hence FORMULA .


Proof of Theorem  REF
Let FORMULA  and FORMULA  be two posets satisfying the
assumptions (REF ) and (REF ), and let
FORMULA , FORMULA  be the partial orders on FORMULA  as defined
by (REF ). We will prove the universal derived equivalence
of FORMULA  and FORMULA  by defining two formulas FORMULA ,
FORMULA  that will induce, for any abelian category FORMULA ,
functors
FORMULA 

such that FORMULA  and
FORMULA .
Definition of the formulas to points
For FORMULA  and FORMULA , let
FORMULA 

where FORMULA  is the identity matrix. We consider FORMULA , FORMULA  and
FORMULA  as formulas either in FORMULA  or in
FORMULA , as appropriate. If FORMULA , define
FORMULA 

as in Example REF . If FORMULA , let
FORMULA 

be formulas to FORMULA  and define
FORMULA 

as compositions with the formula FORMULA  defined in (REF ).
In explicit terms, let FORMULA , FORMULA , and denote by FORMULA  the restriction maps in
FORMULA  and by FORMULA  the restriction maps in FORMULA . For FORMULA  and
FORMULA , let FORMULA 
and FORMULA  be the canonical
inclusions and projections. Then
FORMULA 

for FORMULA , FORMULA .

Definition of the restriction maps
We shall denote by FORMULA  the restriction maps between the formulas
in FORMULA  and by FORMULA  the maps between those in FORMULA . We
consider several cases, and use the explicit notation.
For FORMULA , define
FORMULA 
For FORMULA , we use the isomorphism FORMULA 
and the property that FORMULA  for all FORMULA  to
define the diagonal maps
FORMULA 
If FORMULA , then by (REF ), FORMULA , FORMULA , and we define
FORMULA 
Finally, if FORMULA , by (REF ) there exists a
unique FORMULA  such that FORMULA  and we set
FORMULA .
Similarly, if FORMULA , there exists a unique FORMULA  with
FORMULA , and we set FORMULA .

Verification of commutativity
Again there are several cases to consider. First, when FORMULA , FORMULA  follows from
the commutativity of the restrictions FORMULA ,
and similarly for FORMULA .
Let FORMULA . Since FORMULA  is an
isomorphism and FORMULA , we can
write
FORMULA 

Now FORMULA  follows from
the commutativity of the restrictions FORMULA 
and FORMULA . The proof for FORMULA  is similar.
If FORMULA , let FORMULA  be the elements
satisfying FORMULA , FORMULA . Then FORMULA  by
uniqueness, since FORMULA . Hence
FORMULA 
The proof for FORMULA  in the case FORMULA  is similar.
If FORMULA  where FORMULA , then FORMULA  is the unique element FORMULA  with FORMULA , and
FORMULA 
by the commutativity of the diagram
FORMULA 
Now if FORMULA , let FORMULA  be the element with FORMULA . Then FORMULA  and commutativity
follows from the previous two cases:
FORMULA 
The proof for FORMULA  in the cases FORMULA  and FORMULA  is similar. Here we also use fact that FORMULA 
is an isomorphism to pick FORMULA  as the
unique element FORMULA  with FORMULA .

Construction of the natural transformations
 FORMULA
Observe that
FORMULA 

where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the formulas defined
in (REF ).
Let FORMULA  be the formula inducing the translation and define
FORMULA , FORMULA  by
FORMULA 

where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are as in (REF ) and FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are as in Proposition REF . The proof of that
proposition also shows that FORMULA  and FORMULA  are morphisms
of formulas and induce natural transformations between functors, which
are quasi-isomorphisms.

Proof of Corollary  REF
Let FORMULA  and FORMULA  be posets, and let FORMULA . Denote by FORMULA  the unique minimal element and consider the map FORMULA 
defined by FORMULA  for all FORMULA . Then
FORMULA 

hence by Corollary REF , FORMULA  and FORMULA  are universally derived equivalent.
