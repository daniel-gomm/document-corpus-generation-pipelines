Abstract
The recursion relations of hierarchical models are studied and contrasted
with functional renormalisation group equations in corresponding
approximations. The formalisms are compared quantitatively for the Ising
universality class, where the spectrum of universal eigenvalues at
criticality is studied. A significant correlation amongst scaling
exponents is pointed out and analysed in view of an underlying
optimisation. Continuous functional flows are provided which match with
high accuracy all known scaling exponents from Dyson's hierarchical model
for discrete block-spin transformations. Implications of the results are
discussed.


1. Introduction
Renormalisation group methods {{cite:3ef1ef4a-48e9-4da7-89a6-7c68ac6f992f}}, and in particular
Wilson's renormalisation group {{cite:f166da5c-d6b2-4800-bc41-3ec606f7a437}},
play an important role in the study of physical systems at strong coupling
and/or large correlations lengths. Differential
implementations of Wilson's idea
{{cite:bccef19b-8619-4f1a-ad5b-5766fb2d1486}}, {{cite:34c349f1-27ec-4795-bfb3-2c7dd2c6413c}}, {{cite:efc1e244-f08a-45fa-a538-10996a4afe35}}, {{cite:8f110e6e-55f4-4646-ad85-9bf78b678d0e}}, {{cite:c68c8e51-4a3c-4d45-9c96-fb029121ad46}}, {{cite:e6aea2e1-badd-4ac5-a201-88e292b63892}}, {{cite:3954ca91-9610-4ce2-afd0-84205a47bee2}}, {{cite:e9cae39e-c71e-4443-8a76-21b4c9fc3566}} rely on an
appropriately-introduced momentum cutoff leading to flow equations for running
couplings and FORMULA -point functions, which can be studied with a large variety
of analytical and numerical methods. Numerical stability and reliability in
the results is ensured through powerful control and optimisation techniques
{{cite:50a96bf2-99c4-49e3-8cf9-1772ff8a8a71}}, {{cite:8935b7f0-07a9-456b-9886-92ebf33a7cfc}}, {{cite:df23a142-2ea3-42d8-966e-8e44f46ed0f9}}, {{cite:aba92f2b-d360-482a-90d8-07973b2da6a8}}. A different
implementation of Wilson's idea is realised in hierarchical models of lattice
scalar theories {{cite:778c0a4b-7bd9-4530-a192-3fb39990f866}}, {{cite:b7985927-84d2-4178-8213-48b5de7e02b2}}, {{cite:4e505941-4922-4355-a834-6837734beaf5}}, {{cite:c047f898-fa4c-476c-b88c-31cb19e99238}}, {{cite:aa678e1e-f69a-441f-8df8-911350c435b7}}. Hierarchical renormalisation group
transformations are often discrete rather than continuous. Here,
sophisticated numerical methods have been developed to extract the relevant
physics, most notably for high-accuracy studies of scaling exponents for
scalar models at criticality {{cite:6b4b155a-cccc-46c5-8418-34b3b1ff1e57}}, {{cite:d1a17a8e-abdd-4277-a1ca-40fa1f760946}}, {{cite:32d9e3c6-fd78-4b60-8e84-ad3ec42ba1dd}}
and related theories (see {{cite:aa678e1e-f69a-441f-8df8-911350c435b7}} and references therein).
Given the close similarity of the underlying principles, it is natural to ask
whether Wilsonian (functional) flows can be linked explicitly, and on a
fundamental level, to hierarchical models. If so, this link would provide a
number of benefits. It will make powerful functional and numerical methods
available to the study of hierarchical models. Vice versa, the numerical tools
for hierarchical models could be employed for functional flows in specific
approximations. Furthermore, an explicit link may lead to a path integral
representation of hierarchical models, allowing for systematic improvements
beyond a standard kinetic term. Finally, well-developed optimisation
techniques for functional flows could be taken over for hierarchical models as
well.
In the limit of continuous hierarchical block-spin transformations, an
explicit link between Dyson's hierarchical model
{{cite:778c0a4b-7bd9-4530-a192-3fb39990f866}}, {{cite:c047f898-fa4c-476c-b88c-31cb19e99238}} and the Wilson-Polchinski flow
{{cite:4fdc441a-1d5f-4c70-9ecf-9b1e2af4e1d4}} in the local potential approximation has been
established long ago by Felder {{cite:99903a80-bb66-47db-b0b3-e5ceabbe36ab}}. Following a conjecture of
{{cite:df23a142-2ea3-42d8-966e-8e44f46ed0f9}}, this link has been extended
{{cite:23037c08-0155-47a1-918b-2b2d7409c5bd}}, {{cite:00f5dece-cf18-410e-9749-9d1911354e0d}} to include optimised versions
{{cite:50a96bf2-99c4-49e3-8cf9-1772ff8a8a71}}, {{cite:8935b7f0-07a9-456b-9886-92ebf33a7cfc}} of Wetterich's flow for the effective average
action {{cite:5bf61fe4-dc4b-444e-944a-d0706cf9b8ca}}. These interrelations have recently been backed-up by
extensive numerical studies of critical potentials and scaling exponents to
high accuracy from either formalism {{cite:2b47ad97-56cb-46d7-a241-a3733ca27d62}}.
In this paper, we evaluate the more general case and ask whether hierarchical
models for discrete block-spin transformations are linked to functional flows
with continuous renormalisation group transformations. We first contrast the
basic setups for functional flows (Sec. 2), background field flows (Sec. 3),
and hierarchical models (Sec. 4). At a Wilson-Fisher fixed point, underlying
similarities and differences are worked out and compared for the leading
scaling exponent (Sec. 5). An extensive numerical study of the eigenvalue
spectrum of the Ising universality class from functional flows is performed
(Sec. 6). A strong correlation of scaling exponents is established and
analysed (Sec. 7). It is shown that specific functional flows match the
leading and subleading scaling exponent from Dyson's hierarchical models for
discrete transformation parameter to high accuracy (Sec. 8). We close with a
discussion of the results and further implications (Sec. 9).
2. Functional Flows
Wilsonian (functional) flows integrate-out quantum fluctuations within a path
integral representation of quantum field theory. In their simplest form, they
are generated through a cutoff term quadratic in the field added to the
Schwinger functional, where the (classical) action is replaced by FORMULA  and FORMULA . The
infrared momentum cutoff FORMULA  ensures that the propagation of small
momentum modes FORMULA  is suppressed, while the large momentum modes
FORMULA  remain unaffected. Under an infinitesimal change in the Wilsonian
(infrared) cutoff scale FORMULA , the effective action FORMULA  changes according
to its functional flow, which reads (FORMULA )
FORMULA 
in the form put forward by Wetterich {{cite:5bf61fe4-dc4b-444e-944a-d0706cf9b8ca}}. The trace denotes a
momentum integration and a summation over fields. The factor FORMULA 
in the integrand is peaked in the vicinity of FORMULA . The cutoff
function FORMULA  obeys FORMULA  as FORMULA , FORMULA  as
FORMULA , and FORMULA  as FORMULA , and can be chosen
freely elsewise, FORMULA  {{cite:50a96bf2-99c4-49e3-8cf9-1772ff8a8a71}}. It ensures that the flow is
well-defined, thereby interpolating between an initial action FORMULA  at
FORMULA  in the ultraviolet (UV) and the full quantum effective action
FORMULA  in the infrared FORMULA .
In addition to providing a momentum cutoff, the function FORMULA  also
controls the stability and convergence of subsequent expansions
{{cite:50a96bf2-99c4-49e3-8cf9-1772ff8a8a71}}, {{cite:8935b7f0-07a9-456b-9886-92ebf33a7cfc}}, {{cite:df23a142-2ea3-42d8-966e-8e44f46ed0f9}}, {{cite:f5aa7c54-9214-4e35-99c6-590e48a89401}}. Therefore, it is
possible to identify optimised momentum cutoffs – within given systematic
expansions – which improve the physical result
{{cite:50a96bf2-99c4-49e3-8cf9-1772ff8a8a71}}, {{cite:8935b7f0-07a9-456b-9886-92ebf33a7cfc}}, {{cite:bfedc09e-430f-4ca1-95eb-81db5ffb2891}}. The construction of optimised
cutoffs {{cite:50a96bf2-99c4-49e3-8cf9-1772ff8a8a71}}, {{cite:8935b7f0-07a9-456b-9886-92ebf33a7cfc}}, {{cite:df23a142-2ea3-42d8-966e-8e44f46ed0f9}}, {{cite:aba92f2b-d360-482a-90d8-07973b2da6a8}} is
central to extract reliable results also in more complex theories including
FORMULA  QCD {{cite:7e35d4de-2638-4d77-917d-8444356a2a42}}, quantum gravity {{cite:f4cfdb30-9913-4fbf-a8b8-be125a31816d}},
thermal physics {{cite:efc1e244-f08a-45fa-a538-10996a4afe35}}, {{cite:8f110e6e-55f4-4646-ad85-9bf78b678d0e}}, {{cite:7249d21c-758d-4d98-b337-6d1c981e24e3}}
and critical phenomena
{{cite:bfedc09e-430f-4ca1-95eb-81db5ffb2891}}, {{cite:dabd8618-84d5-452b-880c-7940f48ba778}}, {{cite:2b47ad97-56cb-46d7-a241-a3733ca27d62}}.
Below, we are interested in FORMULA  scalar theories at criticality, where we can
sent the ultraviolet scale FORMULA . To leading order in the
derivative expansion, the effective action reads FORMULA  and
FORMULA . Introducing FORMULA  with FORMULA , we
find
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  and FORMULA . An irrelevant
constant originating from the angular integration has been rescaled into the
potential and the fields. For the optimal cutoff FORMULA  with FORMULA , the
flow reads {{cite:8935b7f0-07a9-456b-9886-92ebf33a7cfc}}
FORMULA 
after an additional rescaling. This flow is integrated analytically in the
limit of a large number of scalar fields {{cite:f62d9447-0a5e-4f61-8525-af819de59f5b}}. We note that the
universal content of the flow (REF ) is equivalent to the
Wilson-Polchinski flow in the local potential approximation
{{cite:df23a142-2ea3-42d8-966e-8e44f46ed0f9}}, {{cite:23037c08-0155-47a1-918b-2b2d7409c5bd}}, {{cite:00f5dece-cf18-410e-9749-9d1911354e0d}}.
3. Background Field Flows
A different form of the flow (REF ) is obtained for momentum cutoffs which
depend additionally on a background field FORMULA . Background fields are
most commonly used for the study of gauge theories {{cite:3aadcf24-e84a-4319-ad38-4c560915692c}}, see
{{cite:117fb28f-5b95-4082-ada6-a93abe8b18ee}}, {{cite:954e5f11-91d7-4140-b24b-a8dcf5050ba9}}, {{cite:f4cfdb30-9913-4fbf-a8b8-be125a31816d}} for applications. They have
also been employed for a path integral derivation of (generalised) proper-time
flows {{cite:6163a718-f79d-4a72-a52a-2a69139f7ebb}}, {{cite:7458e023-6632-4ef6-9167-f73412370565}}.
In the presence of background fields, the functional FORMULA  turns
into a functional of both fields, FORMULA . In order to
maintain the one-loop exactness of (REF ), the momentum cutoff can only
depend on the background field, but not on the propagating field. Following
{{cite:6163a718-f79d-4a72-a52a-2a69139f7ebb}}, we introduce FORMULA  and FORMULA , where FORMULA . We chose momentum cutoffs of
the form FORMULA , which depend now on the background
field. Here, the regulator cuts off both large momentum modes FORMULA 
and large field amplitudes with FORMULA . The full advantage
of background fields becomes visible once they are identified with the
physical mean, leading to the functional
FORMULA . The resulting flow is closed
provided FORMULA . For scalars, this
relation becomes exact in the infrared limit studied below (for gauge fields,
see {{cite:954e5f11-91d7-4140-b24b-a8dcf5050ba9}}). Using the momentum cutoffs {{cite:6163a718-f79d-4a72-a52a-2a69139f7ebb}}
FORMULA 
we are lead to the background field flow
FORMULA 
If the term FORMULA  on the right hand side is dropped – meaning
that additional flow terms originating from the implicit scale dependence in
the momentum cutoff are neglected over the leading term – the flow (REF )
reduces to the proper-time flow of Liao {{cite:461ba7bb-5a6e-436d-a08b-d00ac5325cdb}}. A general
proper-time flow is a linear combination of the first term in (REF ) for
various FORMULA  {{cite:7458e023-6632-4ef6-9167-f73412370565}}; see {{cite:c6040ae8-d404-4b27-8fa9-e2cd5709d38a}}, {{cite:c859047b-43dc-48bc-9a0c-34b5c80fe2d5}} for
applications.
Next, we specialise to the proper-time approximation to leading order in the
derivative expansion. The flow equation for the effective potential takes the
very simple form
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  parameterises the momentum cutoff, and an irrelevant constant factor
has been rescaled into the potential and the fields. For FORMULA , the flow (REF ) is mapped onto the flow (REF )
{{cite:6163a718-f79d-4a72-a52a-2a69139f7ebb}}. At FORMULA , the flow (REF ) is equivalent to
(REF ), modulo a trivial rescaling. As a final remark, we note that this
proper-time flow is also obtained from linear combinations of higher
scale-derivatives of Callan-Szymanzik flows, without relying on background
fields {{cite:7458e023-6632-4ef6-9167-f73412370565}}. In this representation, the approximation leading
to (REF ) consists in the neglection of higher order flow terms
FORMULA .
4. Hierarchical Models
Several hierarchical models for an effective potential FORMULA  of a
lattice scalar field have been introduced in the literature
{{cite:778c0a4b-7bd9-4530-a192-3fb39990f866}}, {{cite:b7985927-84d2-4178-8213-48b5de7e02b2}}, {{cite:c047f898-fa4c-476c-b88c-31cb19e99238}} (see also {{cite:aa678e1e-f69a-441f-8df8-911350c435b7}}).
The hierarchical transformation laws relate the potential FORMULA  at
momentum scale FORMULA  with an average in field space over FORMULA  at
momentum scale FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the renormalisation group step
parameter. We restrict ourselves to the three-dimensional case; the
generalisation to arbitrary dimensions is straightforward.
In Dyson's model {{cite:778c0a4b-7bd9-4530-a192-3fb39990f866}}, {{cite:c047f898-fa4c-476c-b88c-31cb19e99238}}, the renormalisation group
step FORMULA  for the potential is expressed as
FORMULA 
The details of the averaging procedure are encoded in the measure factor
FORMULA , in the FORMULA -dependence of the potential on the right-hand
side of (REF ), and in the choice for the decimation parameter FORMULA . As
is evident from (REF ), a decimation parameter FORMULA  – employed
for most numerical studies
{{cite:6b4b155a-cccc-46c5-8418-34b3b1ff1e57}}, {{cite:d1a17a8e-abdd-4277-a1ca-40fa1f760946}}, {{cite:32d9e3c6-fd78-4b60-8e84-ad3ec42ba1dd}}, {{cite:aa678e1e-f69a-441f-8df8-911350c435b7}}
– corresponds to a volume decimation of FORMULA  at each iteration. For
Dyson's model, the measure is chosen as
FORMULA 
{{cite:aa678e1e-f69a-441f-8df8-911350c435b7}}, where we require FORMULA  for FORMULA ,
and FORMULA  with FORMULA . A standard choice is
FORMULA  {{cite:99903a80-bb66-47db-b0b3-e5ceabbe36ab}}. By definition, (REF )
describes a flow towards the infrared for decimation parameters FORMULA .
For FORMULA , the hierarchical transformation (REF ) becomes continuous
and the measure factor turns into a FORMULA -function FORMULA . Performing FORMULA (REF ), which is
equivalent to FORMULA (REF ), we arrive at a differential flow equation
for the effective potential {{cite:99903a80-bb66-47db-b0b3-e5ceabbe36ab}}
FORMULA 
where an irrelevant factor is rescaled into the fields and the potential;
FORMULA . The interaction terms in (REF ) originate from the
scale-derivative of the measure FORMULA , which
reads FORMULA  in the limit FORMULA . This
highlights the relevance of the measure factor in hierarchical models. Our
normalisation corresponds to the choice FORMULA  to match with
{{cite:2b47ad97-56cb-46d7-a241-a3733ca27d62}}. The limit (REF ) is independent of FORMULA ,
but at FORMULA , we expect that scaling solutions and exponents from
(REF ) depend on it. Eq. (REF ) is the well-known Wilson-Polchinski flow
{{cite:f166da5c-d6b2-4800-bc41-3ec606f7a437}}, {{cite:4fdc441a-1d5f-4c70-9ecf-9b1e2af4e1d4}}. We therefore conclude that the
potential in (REF ) is related to the potential in (REF ) by a
Legendre transformation {{cite:00f5dece-cf18-410e-9749-9d1911354e0d}}, {{cite:2b47ad97-56cb-46d7-a241-a3733ca27d62}}.
A different version of a hierarchical model has been introduced by Wilson
{{cite:b7985927-84d2-4178-8213-48b5de7e02b2}}. Here, the recursion relation is written as
FORMULA 
In Wilson's original model, the FORMULA -dependence of the measure is
FORMULA , where the normalisation factor FORMULA 
is FORMULA -independent {{cite:aa678e1e-f69a-441f-8df8-911350c435b7}}. The measure factor is different
from the one in Dyson's model, because the Gaussian width is
FORMULA -independent. If instead we employ the measure of Dyson's model, the
limit FORMULA  can be performed analytically.The variance of the Gaussian measure in (REF ) can be changed by an
explicit rescaling of the fields as FORMULA  for
finite FORMULA , see {{cite:aa678e1e-f69a-441f-8df8-911350c435b7}}. Rescaling also the integration
variable FORMULA , and denoting the potential in terms of
the rescaled fields again as FORMULA , we obtain (REF ) with a
rescaled measure FORMULA .
It agrees with the measure of Dyson's model for FORMULA  and
FORMULA . I thank Y. Meurice for e-mail correspondence on this
point. Up to a trivial rescaling, we find
FORMULA 
In contrast to the Wilson-Polchinski flow (REF ), the non-linear term
FORMULA  is absent. This comes about because the integrand of (REF ) – as
opposed to the integrand of (REF ) – is manifestly symmetric under
FORMULA . Numerical evaluations of (REF ) have been reported
in {{cite:b7985927-84d2-4178-8213-48b5de7e02b2}}, {{cite:60520209-0320-4483-b561-4d9b461c7aa1}}. For other representations of
hierarchical models we refer to {{cite:aa678e1e-f69a-441f-8df8-911350c435b7}} and references therein.
5. Matching Hierarchical Models
In order to match hierarchical models by functional flows, we have to detail
the scheme dependences of physical observables in either formalism. In the
functional RG framework, the fully integrated flow is independent of the
momentum cutoff FORMULA  chosen for the integration. Scheme dependences,
which enter as a consequence of truncations of FORMULA , have been
discussed extensively in the literature
{{cite:85a8c6b5-4beb-4fee-b90d-80654405d5b4}}, {{cite:50a96bf2-99c4-49e3-8cf9-1772ff8a8a71}}, {{cite:8935b7f0-07a9-456b-9886-92ebf33a7cfc}}, {{cite:df23a142-2ea3-42d8-966e-8e44f46ed0f9}}, {{cite:f5aa7c54-9214-4e35-99c6-590e48a89401}}. Their
origin is easily understood. Since the momentum cutoff FORMULA  in (REF ) couples
to all operators in the theory, the missing back-coupling of operators
neglected in a given truncation can result in a spurious dependence of
physical observables evaluated either from FORMULA , or from a fixed
point solution FORMULA . The scheme dependence is reduced by
identifying those momentum cutoffs, which, in a given truncation, lead to an
improved convergence and stability of the flow.
In Fig. REF , we discuss the scheme dependence quantitatively for
the leading order scaling exponent FORMULA  at a fixed point of the FORMULA  Ising
universality class {{cite:f5aa7c54-9214-4e35-99c6-590e48a89401}}. Within exact flows (REF ), the
full FORMULA -dependence has been studied in {{cite:bfedc09e-430f-4ca1-95eb-81db5ffb2891}} by evaluating
the fixed points of (REF ) for general cutoffs (Fig. REF ,
first column). The main result is that the range of achievable values is
bounded from above and from below. The upper bound is attained for
Callan-Symanzik type flows with FORMULA . The lower bound with
FORMULA  is attained with the optimal flow (REF ), and
hence equivalent to the Wilson-Polchinski flow. The sharp cutoff result is
indicated for comparison.
FIGURE 
The proper-time flow (REF ) rests on an intrinsically different
truncation, because implicit dependences on the background field have been
neglected as well as higher order flow terms proportional to the flow of
FORMULA ; see Sec. 3. Therefore scheme dependences are quantitatively
different. In the approximation (REF ), the FORMULA -dependence of scaling
exponents from (REF ) has been studied in
{{cite:c6040ae8-d404-4b27-8fa9-e2cd5709d38a}}, {{cite:6163a718-f79d-4a72-a52a-2a69139f7ebb}} (Fig. REF , second column). The
range of values is again bounded from above by a Callan-Symanzik flow. The
lower bound is achieved for FORMULA . We note that the range of values
exceeds those achievable within (standard) exact flows. The lower bound may be
overcome once the additional flow terms, neglected here, are taken into
account {{cite:6163a718-f79d-4a72-a52a-2a69139f7ebb}}. This is indicated by the dashed line.
Next we consider scheme dependences of hierarchical models. Based on their
construction, we expect that physical observables depend on the averaging
procedure, on the measure factor FORMULA , and on the decimation parameter
FORMULA . It has proven difficult to systematically include wave function
renormalisations and higher order operators in hierarchical models, and it is
therefore not known whether the scheme dependence vanishes upon higher order
corrections {{cite:4e505941-4922-4355-a834-6837734beaf5}}, {{cite:aa678e1e-f69a-441f-8df8-911350c435b7}}. Still, the scheme dependence
should give a reasonable estimate for the underlying error in the model
assumptions, in particular in comparison with functional methods.
The FORMULA -dependence of Wilson's model (REF ), originally constructed for
FORMULA , has been studied in {{cite:60520209-0320-4483-b561-4d9b461c7aa1}} in the range
FORMULA  (Fig. REF , third column). The full line covers
the range of values obtained in the literature, while the dashed lines
indicate that the underlying parameter space has not been exhausted. Because
of (REF ) being linear in the potential as opposed to (REF ), we
expect a strong FORMULA -dependence, possibly a discontinuity, in the limit
FORMULA . The slope FORMULA  along the data points
with FORMULA  is negative, meaning that FORMULA  increases for
smaller FORMULA . We stress that Wilson's HM has an overlap both with exact
flows and proper-time flows. Therefore, it is possible to map FORMULA  of
Wilson's model for certain decimation parameters FORMULA  onto FORMULA  from
functional flows with appropriately chosen FORMULA . On the other hand, for some
decimation parameter FORMULA , Wilson's model can only be mapped onto
proper-time flows but not on exact flows, while for some decimation parameter
it cannot be mapped onto either of them.
The FORMULA -dependence of Dyson's model (REF ) is displayed in
Fig. REF , fourth column. The full line connects the known results
at FORMULA  {{cite:bfedc09e-430f-4ca1-95eb-81db5ffb2891}}, {{cite:2b47ad97-56cb-46d7-a241-a3733ca27d62}}, FORMULA 
{{cite:6b4b155a-cccc-46c5-8418-34b3b1ff1e57}}, {{cite:32d9e3c6-fd78-4b60-8e84-ad3ec42ba1dd}}
and FORMULA  {{cite:6b4b155a-cccc-46c5-8418-34b3b1ff1e57}}. The dashed line towards larger values
for FORMULA  indicates that the parameter space FORMULA  has not been
exhausted. We note that the FORMULA -dependence is very weak, with a tiny slope
in the range of FORMULA -values covered. The important observation is that the
slope FORMULA  is positive in the vicinity of
FORMULA , implying that FORMULA  for FORMULA .
Consequently, it is possible to map the scaling exponent FORMULA  at
discrete block-spin transformation FORMULA  onto FORMULA  from functional
flows for specific momentum cutoff FORMULA , both within the standard exact flows
and within proper-time flows. This supports the conjecture that Dyson's model
can be mapped onto functional flows.
6. Spectrum of Eigenvalues
Whether the observations of the preceeding section can be promoted to a full
map between the formalisms crucially depends on further observables including
the subleading scaling exponents. Here and in the following section, we study
the spectrum of universal eigenvalues (scaling exponents) form functional
flows (REF ) to high accuracy. A fixed point solution FORMULA 
of (REF ) is characterised by the universal eigenvalues of
eigenperturbations in its vicinity. We denote the ordered set of eigenvalues
as FORMULA , with
FORMULA  for FORMULA .In our conventions, the sole negative
eigenvalue at the Wilson-Fisher fixed point is FORMULA . In addition to
the leading exponent FORMULA , we study the first three
subleading scaling exponents FORMULA , FORMULA  and
FORMULA  within the exact flow (REF ) for various cutoffs and
coarse graining parameters.
For the numerical analysis, we introduce several classes of momentum cutoffs
defined through FORMULA , FORMULA ; FORMULA , with FORMULA ; and FORMULA . These cutoffs include the sharp cutoff
FORMULA  and asymptotically smooth Callan-Symanzik type cutoffs FORMULA  as limiting cases. The larger the parameter FORMULA , for each class, the
`sharper' the corresponding momentum cutoff. The cutoff FORMULA 
probes a two-dimensional parameter space in the vicinity of FORMULA  to
which it reduces for FORMULA  and FORMULA . For integer FORMULA , FORMULA  is a
FORMULA  function. In addition, we consider the cutoffs FORMULA  and FORMULA , which obey FORMULA . Note that we have covered a large variety of qualitatively
different momentum cutoffs including exponential, algebraic, power-law, sharp
cutoffs and cutoffs with compact support. Except for FORMULA , all
cutoffs are FORMULA -functions. We employ the numerical techniques
developed in {{cite:bfedc09e-430f-4ca1-95eb-81db5ffb2891}}, {{cite:2b47ad97-56cb-46d7-a241-a3733ca27d62}}.

FIGURE 
Our results for the universal eigenvalues at criticality are displayed in
Fig. REF  for the six two-dimensional projections of the
four-dimensional subspace FORMULA  of
observables. The plot contains roughly FORMULA  data points, the different
classes of cutoffs are colour-coded. We focus on the relevant FORMULA -vicinity
of the Wilson-Polchinski result with scaling exponents FORMULA  from (REF ), indicated by a large
black dot, see {{cite:2b47ad97-56cb-46d7-a241-a3733ca27d62}} for the high-accuracy numerical
values. The central result of Fig. REF  is that scaling
exponents are very strongly correlated. Despite having probed the space of
observables by many qualitatively different momentum cutoffs, we find that
only a small subset of values can actually be achieved. The correlations
increase the closer the eigenvalues FORMULA  move towards FORMULA . In the immediate vicinity of the Wilson-Polchinski result, we only
find a very narrow “throat” connecting observables FORMULA  with FORMULA . For the sub-leading scaling exponents FORMULA , the throat
remains very narrow even further away from FORMULA . This is seen
most clearly in the correlation of FORMULA  with FORMULA  in
Fig. REF e), as well as in the correlations of FORMULA 
with both FORMULA  and FORMULA  in Fig. REF d) and f).
In turn, for the leading exponents FORMULA , the throat opens up more rapidly
once its value is further away from FORMULA , see
Fig. REF a), b) and c).
7. Correlations of Eigenvalues
The strong correlation of scaling exponents is a structural fingerprint of
Wilsonian flows (REF ). Since
the Wilson-Polchinski result is distinguished in the space of scaling
exponents, it is natural to normalise the data of Fig. REF 
with respect to it. We introduce the distance of any pair of scaling exponents
FORMULA  from the optimal result FORMULA  as
FORMULA 
We have chosen a standard metric in the space of observables (other choices
can be applied as well). In this representation, full agreement with the
(optimal) Wilson-Polchinski result is achieved for FORMULA  and
FORMULA . We also introduce the angles
FORMULA 
The critical indices FORMULA  and FORMULA , are positive numbers.
Therefore, they can cover the range FORMULA  and
FORMULA , and FORMULA  for any pair of observables
FORMULA . In the subspace FORMULA , the extremal values FORMULA  have the polar coordinates FORMULA , where the angle reads FORMULA  which is close to FORMULA , and FORMULA . The radial distance from the origin is FORMULA .
FIGURE 
FIGURE 
In the representation (REF ), we can study the close vicinity of the
Wilson-Polchinski result. In Fig. REF , we display our data
points as functions of the angles FORMULA , and their distance from
FORMULA  in a semi-logarithmic basis. It is noteworthy that only a
very narrow range of angles FORMULA  is actually achieved by the data,
despite the fact that large fractions of the underlying space of momentum
cutoffs is covered. Also, and in contrast to Fig. REF a),
many data points are degenerate in the representation FORMULA . A
priori, the Wilson-Polchinski value FORMULA  could
have been approached along many different paths. Instead, we find that only a
narrow range of FORMULA -values is achieved for arbitrary
momentum cutoff.
This pattern is further highlighted in Fig. REF , where we have
magnified the non-trivial range of data sets from functional flows
(REF ). In addition, we have added data points from the background field
flow (REF ) using the cutoff FORMULA  for FORMULA . It is
remarkable that these data sets display the same pattern as the data from
(REF ). Our results from this and the preceeding section are summarised
as follows:
Extremum.— The Wilson-Polchinski (optimal flow) result in
Fig. REF  corresponds to an extremum in the space of
physical observables with FORMULA  for all
obervables in the vicinity of FORMULA . The extremum is local,
because the exponents approach FORMULA , FORMULA , for very soft
(Callan-Symanzik-type) momentum cutoffs {{cite:bfedc09e-430f-4ca1-95eb-81db5ffb2891}}. For the
eigenvalue products FORMULA , the
Wilson-Polchinski extremum is a global one.
Uniqueness.— Our result indicates that the correlations of
eigenvalues at the Wilson-Pochinski result are strongest, in the sense that
any flow of the form (REF ) with the exponent FORMULA 
automatically also agrees with the Wilson-Polchinski result in all other
observables FORMULA . In general, for FORMULA , this is clearly not the case.
Redundancy.—
The eigenvalue correlations are so strong that the first two scaling exponents
FORMULA  and FORMULA , for a given FORMULA , contain enough information to fix
the remaining observables on the percent level or below. These `dynamical'
constraints point at a major redundancy of (REF ) with respect to the
underlying momentum cutoffs FORMULA . A relevant parameter has been identified
previously. The gap FORMULA  for normalised cutoffs
{{cite:50a96bf2-99c4-49e3-8cf9-1772ff8a8a71}}, when maximised, leads towards the Wilson-Polchinski
result {{cite:8935b7f0-07a9-456b-9886-92ebf33a7cfc}}, {{cite:df23a142-2ea3-42d8-966e-8e44f46ed0f9}}, {{cite:bfedc09e-430f-4ca1-95eb-81db5ffb2891}}.
Optimised observables.— Previous reasonings in favour of an
optimisation only invoked properties of the underlying flow (REF ),
FORMULA  its convergence, locality, stability and boundedness, allowing for
improved physical predictions. This has been exemplified quantitatively for
the observable FORMULA  which obeys FORMULA 
{{cite:bfedc09e-430f-4ca1-95eb-81db5ffb2891}}, where the lower bound FORMULA  is closest to the
physical result {{cite:23037c08-0155-47a1-918b-2b2d7409c5bd}}. Fig. REF  now shows
that this pattern extends to subleading eigenvalues. This equally extends to
asymmetric corrections-to-scaling {{cite:950e5216-2ce0-4db8-96c6-a9ac29de82c9}}. Therefore, one may
turn the original reasoning around and argue that – because of the extremum
property of the observables FORMULA  – an extremisation of the
functional flow along the lines discussed in
{{cite:50a96bf2-99c4-49e3-8cf9-1772ff8a8a71}}, {{cite:8935b7f0-07a9-456b-9886-92ebf33a7cfc}}, {{cite:aba92f2b-d360-482a-90d8-07973b2da6a8}}, or similar, should
naturally lead towards the values FORMULA . Stated differently,
Figs. REF -REF  show that observables derived
from (REF ) admit an optimisation.
Finally, we note that the data point from Dyson's hierarchical model with
FORMULA  – as plotted in Figs. REF 
and REF  – nicely fits into the set of data points covered by
functional flows, extending the link observed in Sec. 5 beyond the leading
exponent. This observation is addressed quantitatively in the following
section.
8. Matching Beyond the Leading Exponent
To further substantiate our conjecture that hierarchical models could be
mapped onto functional flows, we have to show quantitatively that results from
hierarchical model are reproduced by specific functional flows. Here, we
study the close vicinity of the Wilson-Polchinski result FORMULA ,
where the correlations are strongest, see Figs. REF 
and REF . We have to restrict our search to Dyson's
hierarchical model, where high-accuracy data for the first sub-leading scaling
exponent FORMULA  is available. No subleading exponents have been computed for
Wilson's model.
For the numerical analysis, we introduce additional classes of momentum
cutoffs FORMULA  which contain the optimal flow (REF ) in some limit. In
addition to the two-parameter family of cutoffs FORMULA , we also
study the cutoff FORMULA  for
FORMULA  which is FORMULA , and the cutoff FORMULA  with FORMULA , which is effective
for a finite interval of momenta FORMULA . In the limit FORMULA 
FORMULA , the corresponding flows are equivalent to (REF ). Hence,
FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  parametrise
substantially different classes of cutoffs. More generally, there are
infinitely many cutoffs FORMULA  leading to scaling exponents identical with
FORMULA , and the examples provided above serve to
illustrate this.
TABLE 
At FORMULA , Dyson's hierarchical transformation is continuous, and the
scaling exponents are equivalent to those from the optimal flow (REF )
and the Wilson-Polchinski flow (REF ). In Tab. REF , we
compare exponents from different functional flows. We confirm numerically, and
with high accuracy, that the cutoffs FORMULA , FORMULA  and
FORMULA  lead to the Wilson-Polchinski result for specific parameter
values.
At FORMULA , Dyson's hierarchical transformation is discrete. The
reference data reads FORMULA  and FORMULA  {{cite:32d9e3c6-fd78-4b60-8e84-ad3ec42ba1dd}}.In {{cite:32d9e3c6-fd78-4b60-8e84-ad3ec42ba1dd}},
high-accuracy results at FORMULA  have been given for
FORMULA  and FORMULA  (and FORMULA  with 13 significant digits. They imply FORMULA  and FORMULA . For the
present study, only the first six figures are required. These values differ
only at the order FORMULA  from the optimal (Wilson-Polchinski) result, and
are therefore sufficiently close to FORMULA  to confirm or refute
the correlations observed in the previous section.
Figs. REF  and REF  indicate that the result
from Dyson's hierarchical model is fully matched by functional flows. Our
numerical results are given in Tab. REF ; brackets indicate that
a digit is possibly affected by numerical errors. We have found several sets
of parameter values, such that the scaling exponents agree with Dyson's model
to order FORMULA . More importantly, the momentum cutoffs are quite
different. Hence, our analysis also confirms the strong correlation of
scaling exponents in the immediate vicinity of the Wilson-Polchinski result.
Based on the eigenvalue correlations within functional flows, we conjecture
that the subleading eigenvalues FORMULA  with FORMULA  of Dyson's model at
FORMULA  also agree to the corresponding accuracy with the values
implied through the functional flows in Tab. REF .
Our results based on the proper-time flow (REF ) with FORMULA  has
also been given in Tab. REF . Full agreement is achieved either
with the exponent FORMULA  or the subleading exponent
FORMULA , but not with both of them. Once one of them is
matched, the deviation in the other observable is of the order FORMULA . The
relevant parameters are FORMULA , the regime where (REF ) is mapped onto
(REF ) {{cite:6163a718-f79d-4a72-a52a-2a69139f7ebb}}. Therefore, the values in
Tab. REF  reflects well the range covered by standard Wilsonian
flows (REF ). We expect that full agreement is achieved for proper-time
flows which are linear combinations of (REF ) for different FORMULA , but we
did not attempt to do so here.
TABLE 
In summary, we have provided numerical maps from several functional flows onto
Dyson's model at a non-trivial FORMULA , with an accuracy of the order
FORMULA . The set of achievable values for scaling exponents from functional
flows in the close vicinity of the optimal result is just wide enough to
accommodate for the data from Dyson's model. This is a non-trivial result,
also showing that the FORMULA -dependence of Dyson's model and the
FORMULA -dependence of functional flows are very intimately related. Based on
our results for FORMULA  and FORMULA  at FORMULA , and on continuity in
FORMULA , we expect that this map extends to other universal quantities in the
same approximation, analogous to the full map which is known for FORMULA .
Data for further symmetric and asymmetric corrections-to-scaling exponents,
once available, will allow for additional checks of this picture. Full
equivalence is guaranteed as soon as an explicit link in the form
FORMULA  or FORMULA  is furnished. For the local
potential approximation, our results indicate that this map, if it exists, is
not unique.
9. Discussion and Conclusions
Establishing equivalences between implementations of Wilson's renormalisation
group as different as discrete hierarchical models of lattice scalar fields on
one side and continuous functional flows on the other, allows for new views
and insights on the respective formalisms and on the underlying physics.
Previously, equivalences were known only in the limit where the hierarchical
transformation becomes continuous. In this paper, based on similarities in
the dependences related to the underlying coarse-graining, we have extended
this link towards discrete hierarchical transformations. This correspondence
shows that continuous RG flows (REF ) are sensitive to implicit
discretisation effects via the momentum cutoff.
Specifically, for the FORMULA  Ising universality class, we have compared the
formalisms on the level of scaling exponents. Their dependence on the
step-size parameter FORMULA  within Dyson's hierarchical model (REF ) is
qualitatively and quantitatively similar to their dependence on the momentum
cutoff FORMULA  within functional flows (REF ). In either case, scaling
exponents are bounded by the Wilson-Polchinski values obtained for FORMULA  and FORMULA . Once the hierarchical transformations are
discrete, FORMULA , slight variations in all known scaling exponents from
Dyson's model are matched by functional flows with non-optimal momentum
cutoffs FORMULA . This is quite remarkable, particularily in view
of the strong eigenvalue correlations found amongst functional flows. In this
light, the optimisation of functional flows with FORMULA  can now,
alternatively, be viewed as the removal of discretisation effects, at least to
leading order in a derivative expansion as studied here. It will be
interesting to contrast these findings with the construction of improved or
perfect actions on the lattice. More generally, it is conceivable that
Dyson's model for arbitrary FORMULA  is mapped by functional flows on a
fundamental level beyond the numerical map provided for FORMULA . An
explicit map would be very welcome, also in view of linking hierarchical
models to a path integral representation of the theory. In Wilson's
hierarchical model (REF ), the range covered by the leading scaling exponent
indicates that a partial map onto functional flows exists, though only for a
restricted domain of FORMULA -values. Interestingly, the overlap with background
field flows is even larger. Whether these maps extend beyond the leading
exponent cannot be settled presently due to a lack of data for subleading
exponents from Wilson's model.
In addition, we found a distinct correlation of scaling exponents from
functional flows (REF ). The eigenvalue spectrum, a fingerprint of the
physics in a local potential approximation, is severely constrained and
achieves the Wilson-Polchinski values as an extremum. Furthermore, the full
space of physical observables is described by very few parameters only,
instead of the infinitely many moments of the momentum cutoff. Resolving this
redundancy should prove useful for studies of FORMULA  non-trivial momentum
structures and higher orders in the derivative expansion. Finally this
pattern amongst physical observables highlights the extremum property of
cutoffs leading to the optimal Wilson-Polchinski result
{{cite:50a96bf2-99c4-49e3-8cf9-1772ff8a8a71}}, {{cite:8935b7f0-07a9-456b-9886-92ebf33a7cfc}}, {{cite:df23a142-2ea3-42d8-966e-8e44f46ed0f9}}, {{cite:aba92f2b-d360-482a-90d8-07973b2da6a8}}. We expect
that the intimate link between optimised flows on one side, and extremum
points in the space of observables on the other, persists in more complex
theories. This observation will prove useful for studies in QCD and quantum
gravity, where an appropriate optimisation is even more important to extract
the relevant physics.
