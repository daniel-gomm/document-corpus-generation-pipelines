and vector bundles provided with nonintegrable distributions defining
nonlinear connection structures induced canonically by metric tensors. Such
spaces are called nonholonomic manifolds and described by two equivalent
linear connections also induced in unique forms by a metric tensor (the Levi
Civita and the canonical distinguished connection, d–connection). The
lifts of geometric objects on tangent bundles are performed for certain
classes of d–connections and frame transforms when the Riemann tensor is
parametrized by constant matrix coefficients. For such configurations, the
flows of non–stretching curves and corresponding bi–Hamilton and solitonic
hierarchies encode information about Ricci flow evolution, Einstein spaces
and exact solutions in gravity and geometric mechanics. The applied methods
were elaborated formally in Finsler geometry and allows us to develop the
formalism for generalized Riemann–Finsler and Lagrange spaces.
Nevertheless, all geometric constructions can be equivalently re–defined
for the Levi Civita connections and holonomic frames on (semi) Riemannian
manifolds.

 Introduction
Both the theory of Ricci flows and the theory of integrable partial
differential equations have deep links to the geometry of curves and
surfaces, generalized Riemann–Finsler spaces and geometric analysis:
Originally, the Ricci flow theory has addressed geometrical and topological
issues, and certain applications in physics, for Riemannian manifolds {{cite:939a3dc5-65f6-41ec-8c74-c533b5666c8f}}, {{cite:e2c9318d-c689-458b-870b-6f5ac77ba0bb}}, {{cite:1893c7c2-0995-4562-aad5-8f879544f07d}}, {{cite:1735753d-162b-40b0-b181-9e67e0a2f9d2}}, {{cite:bd693ba3-8eda-4eb2-8366-28d5169e1428}} (we cite here some reviews on
Hamilton–Perelman theory {{cite:1fa7b337-ad0e-4a2b-bb9a-b6a255a41bfc}}, {{cite:9e0a6355-fe78-4d67-b8f1-fe0af104036e}}, {{cite:0511851e-f928-4a78-9b7b-cf271720d2f3}}, {{cite:b8124a5d-fec4-4a0c-a1d9-cf78cef7d2c8}}). In parallel,
it was found that various classes of solitonic equations (for instance, the
sine–Gordon, SG, and modified Korteveg–de Vries, mKdV, equations) and
along with their hierarchies of symmetries, conservation laws and associated
recursion operators can be encoded into the geometry of flows of
non–stretching curves in Riemannian symmetric spaces and related Lie
algebras and Klein spaces {{cite:3401f941-6717-4a3a-80e2-15c98a597abb}}, {{cite:ce151d78-4368-4fff-af5c-2558487198b3}}, {{cite:f4016e48-eeea-434e-b6af-7b22b420ba23}}, {{cite:769cd7d7-c2dd-4142-b5b2-1a2367e64707}}, {{cite:e1743214-cfbe-491c-8740-00d15bedb5fc}}, {{cite:ef487ffe-622a-4fd0-b4b2-099f42e5615c}}, {{cite:107a017f-4fd6-477a-afa1-442671037c9d}}, {{cite:55195732-bfed-48bf-af0f-1379aeae1823}},
see also reviews and new results in Refs. {{cite:1a7aaaf9-f592-4597-ad03-da2e5f53515d}}, {{cite:08d49a84-2e92-419e-8a63-4f8fed3c0c54}}.
In {{cite:9bdd082b-47ac-402b-8491-026f8db7a3d6}}, it was proven that a more general class of (pseudo)
Riemannian spaces can be encoded into bi–Hamilton structures and related
solitonic hierarchies. The key construction was to deform nonholonomically
the frame and linear connection structures in order to get constant matrix
curvature coefficients, with respect to certain classes of nonholonomic
frames. Such frames are adapted to a nonlinear connection (N–connection)
structure induced by some generic off–diagonal metric coefficients . We
also concluded that having generated the corresponding solitonic hierarchies
for the so–called canonical distinguished connection (d–connection), we
can re–define equivalently the geometric objects, conservation laws and
basic equations and solutions in terms of the usual Levi Civita connection.
The formalism applied in {{cite:9bdd082b-47ac-402b-8491-026f8db7a3d6}}, based on the geometry of moving
nonholonomic frames with associated N–connection structure, was originally
developed in Finsler–Lagrange geometry and generalizations {{cite:97660bbd-af2a-4f72-9fa0-84a162bed888}}, {{cite:80a8179e-a641-418a-9f4e-35710c1599f4}}, {{cite:7405b234-de60-483c-8e71-1ebd718784b5}}. Our idea {{cite:3438d6f9-d64e-4409-a2da-77b241d06b44}} was to apply it to usual (semi)
Riemannian spaces, or to Riemann–Cartan ones (with nontrivial torsion),
prescribing certain nonholonomic distributions arising naturally if we
constrain partially some degrees of freedom. For such systems, there are
defined certain classes of preferred frames and symmetries for the
gravitational and matter field interactions. Following this approach, it was
possible to construct various classes of exact solutions in Einstein and
string gravity modelling Finsler like locally anisotropic structure,
possessing noncommutative symmetries and defining generically off–diagonal
metrics and nonlinear interactions of pp–waves, two and three dimensional
gravitational solitons and spinor fields {{cite:3438d6f9-d64e-4409-a2da-77b241d06b44}}, {{cite:4d54e505-a4bc-427a-a87e-b6339c0a3b5a}}, {{cite:6cd882ed-efd7-40a9-89c5-7c158e37938a}}.
Nevertheless, if realistic theories of gravitational and gauge field
interactions and/or generalized Finsler models of geometric mechanics are
introduced into consideration, the solitonic encoding of metric, connection
and frame structures is possible for certain effective generalized Lagrange
spaces. In this case, we model the geometric constructions on couples of
symmetric Riemannian spaces provided with nonholonomic distributions. The
work {{cite:036ee834-ceda-4d97-aed6-c66506202b38}} concluded an approach when different theories of gravity
and geometric mechanics are treated in a unified geometric way as
nonholonomic (semi) Riemannian manifolds, or vector bundles. It was also
proven that the data for geometric objects and fundamental physical
equations (their symmetries and conservation laws) can be encoded into
bi–Hamilton structures and correspondingly derived solitonic hierarchies.
Integrable and nonintegrable (i.e. holonomic and nonholonomic / anholonomic)
flows of geometric structures were also recently considered in a series of
works on nonholonomic Ricci flows {{cite:e09e6678-a643-4110-b533-4ea8d6d5aeac}}, {{cite:a00081af-b241-4deb-be65-ec99ac184c50}} and applications in
physics {{cite:8c291982-ce0d-4401-9dff-2eb7a9b0d7cc}}, {{cite:fb66176a-9e82-4a86-ae15-144aff34ae6d}}, {{cite:29e789ff-d73c-4b53-aae3-e478eafdc226}}, {{cite:65879e11-0bad-41e6-9109-1698c999d777}}. Some important results of those
works were the proofs that constrained Ricci flows of (semi) Riemannian
metrics result in Finsler like metrics and generalizations and, inversely,
Finsler–Lagrange type geometrical objects can be described equivalently by
flows on Riemann (in general, Riemann–Cartan) spaces.
The goal of this paper, the third one in a series defined together with {{cite:e09e6678-a643-4110-b533-4ea8d6d5aeac}}, {{cite:a00081af-b241-4deb-be65-ec99ac184c50}}, is to prove that solitonic hierarchies can be generated by
any (semi) Riemannian metric FORMULA  on a manifold FORMULA  of dimension FORMULA  if the the geometrical objects are lifted in the total space of
the tangent bundle FORMULA  or of a vector bundle FORMULA  FORMULA  by defining such frame transforms when constant matrix
curvatures are defined canonically with respect to certain classes of
preferred systems of reference. We shall also define the criteria when
families of bi–Hamilton structures and solitonic hierarchies encode (in
general, nonholonomic) Ricci flow evolutions of geometric objects and/ or
exact solutions of gravitational field equations.
The paper is organized as follows:
In section 2 we outline the geometry of nonholonomic manifolds and vector/
tangent bundles provided with nonlinear connection structure. We emphasize
the possibility to define fundamental geometric objects induced by a (semi)
Riemannian metric on the base space when the Riemannian curvature tensor has
constant coefficients with respect to a preferred nonholonomic basis. We
also present some results on evolution equations of nonholonomic Ricci flows
and exact solutions in gravity.
In section 3 we consider Ricci flow families of curve flows on nonholonomic
vector bundles. We sketch an approach to classification of such spaces
defined by conventional horizontal and vertical symmetric (semi) Riemannian
subspaces and provided with nonholonomic distributions defined by the
nonlinear connection structure. It is constructed a corresponding family of
nonholonomic Klein spaces for which the bi–Hamiltonian operators are
defined by canonical distinguished connections, adapted to the nonlinear
connection structure, for which the distinguished curvature coefficients are
constant.
Section 4 is devoted to the formalism of distinguished bi–Hamiltonian
operators and vector soliton equations for arbitrary (semi) Riemannian
spaces. Then we consider the properties of cosympletic and sympletic
operators adapted to the nonlinear connection structure. We define the basic
equations for nonholonomic curve flows and parametrize their possible Ricci
flows.
Section 5 is devoted to formulation of the Main Result: a proof that for any
nonholonomic Ricci flow system, one can be defined a natural family of
N–adapted bi–Hamiltonian flow hierarchies inducing anholonomic solitonic
configurations. There are constructed in explicit form the solitonic
hierarchies corresponding to the bi–Hamiltonian anholonomic curve flows.
Finally, there are speculated the conditions when from solitonic hierarchies
we can extract solutions of the Ricci flow and/or field equations.
We summarize and discuss the results in section 6. For convenience, we
outline the necessary definitions and formulas from the geometry of
nonholonomic manifolds in Appendix A. Then, in Appendix B, we consider the
geometry of N–anholonomic Klein spaces. A proof of the Main Theorem is
sketched in Appendix C.
Notation remarks:
There are considered two types of flows of geometrical objects on manifolds
of necessary smooth class, induced by 1) non–stretching curve flows FORMULA  defined by real parameters FORMULA  and FORMULA 
and 2) Ricci flows of metrics FORMULA  parametrized by a real FORMULA  The non–stretching flows of a curve are constrained by the condition FORMULA  which under Ricci flows
transforms into a family of such conditions, FORMULA  For Ricci flows, we get evolutions of families of
non–stretching curves parametrized by hypersurfaces FORMULA  It is convenient to
use in parallel two types of denotations for the geometric objects subjected
to both curve and Ricci flows: by emphasized all dependencies on parameters FORMULA  and FORMULA  or by introducing ”up/low” labels like FORMULA  or  FORMULA
We shall also write ”boldface” symbols for geometric objects and spaces
adapted to a noholonomic/ nonlinear connection structure, like FORMULA  and write FORMULA  if the nonholonomic structure became trivial, i.e.
integrable/ holonomic. In order to investigate the properties of curve and
Ricci flow evolution equations it is convenient to use both abstract/global
denotations and coefficient formulas with respect to coordinate or
nonholonomic bases.
A nonholonomic distribution with associated nonlinear connection structure
splits the manifolds into conventional horizontal (h) and vertical (v)
subspaces. The geometric objects, for instance, a vector FORMULA  can be
written in abstract form as FORMULA  or in
coefficient forms as FORMULA  where FORMULA  can be equivalently decomposed with
respect to a general nonholonomic frame FORMULA 
or coordinate frame FORMULA  for local h- and v–coordinates FORMULA 
or FORMULA  when FORMULA  and FORMULA  when indices will be underlined if it is
necessary to emphasize certain decompositions are defined for coordinate
bases. The h–indices FORMULA  will be used for base/
nonholonomic vector objects and the v–indices FORMULA 
will be used for fiber/ holonomic vector objects. Greek indices of type FORMULA  will be used as cumulative ones.
Finally, we note that we shall omit labels, indices and parametric/
coordinate dependencies for some formulas if it does not result in
ambiguities.

Nonholonomic Lifts and Ricci Flows
In this section, we prove that for any family of (semi) Riemannian metrics FORMULA  on a manifold FORMULA  parametrized by a real parameter FORMULA 
it is possible to define lifts to the tangent bundle FORMULA  provided with
canonical nonlinear connection (in brief, N–connection), Sasaki type
metrics and (linear) canonical distinguished connection (d–connection)
structures. We also outline some important formulas for nonholonomic Ricci
flow evolution equations of geometric structures. The reader is recommended
to consult Refs. {{cite:3438d6f9-d64e-4409-a2da-77b241d06b44}}, {{cite:4d54e505-a4bc-427a-a87e-b6339c0a3b5a}}, {{cite:97660bbd-af2a-4f72-9fa0-84a162bed888}}, {{cite:80a8179e-a641-418a-9f4e-35710c1599f4}}, {{cite:e09e6678-a643-4110-b533-4ea8d6d5aeac}}, {{cite:a00081af-b241-4deb-be65-ec99ac184c50}} and Appendix A on
details on N–connection geometry and recent developments in modern gravity
and Ricci flow theory.
N–connections induced by families of Riemannian metrics
Let FORMULA  be a (smooth) vector bundle over base
manifold FORMULA  FORMULA  and FORMULA  for FORMULA  and FORMULA 
being the dimension of the typical fiber FORMULA  It is defined a surjective
submersion FORMULA  In any point FORMULA  the total space FORMULA 
splits into ”horizontal”, FORMULA  and ”vertical”, FORMULA  subspaces.
We denote the local coordinates in the form FORMULA  or FORMULA  with horizontal indices FORMULA  and vertical indices  FORMULAIn a particular case, we have a tangent bundle FORMULA  when FORMULA 
for such bundles both type of indices run the same values but it is
convenient to distinguish the horizontal and vertical ones by using
different groups of small Latin indices. Here one should be noted that on FORMULA  we are able to contract the vertical indices with the corresponding
horizontal ones, and inversely, but not on a general nonholonomic manifold FORMULA  or  FORMULA The summation rule on the same ”up” and
”low” indices will be applied.
The base manifold FORMULA  is provided with a family of (semi) Riemannian
metrics, nondegenerate second rank tensors,in physical literature, one uses the term (pseudo) Riemannian/Euclidean space FORMULA 
for FORMULA  We also introduce a family of
vertical metrics FORMULA  by completing the matrices FORMULA  diagonally with FORMULA  till any nondegenerate second rank tensor FORMULA  if FORMULA  and then subjecting to any frame
transforms. This way, we define certain families of metrics FORMULA  (we shall
also use the notation FORMULA  on FORMULA  Considering
frame (vielbein) transforms,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is written in equivalent form
FORMULA  we can deform the
metric structures, FORMULA  (we shall omit dependencies on coordinates and parameters
if it does not result in ambiguities). The coefficients FORMULA  will be defined below (see formula (REF )) from the condition of generating curvature tensors with constant
coefficients with respect to certain preferred systems of reference.
For any FORMULA  from the set FORMULA  we can
construct a family of effective generation functions
FORMULA 
inducing families of vertical metrics
FORMULA 
which is ”weakly” regular if  FORMULA
By straightforward computations, we provesee Refs. {{cite:97660bbd-af2a-4f72-9fa0-84a162bed888}}, {{cite:80a8179e-a641-418a-9f4e-35710c1599f4}} for details of a similar proof; here we note that
in our case, in general,   FORMULA:
Theorem 2.1 The family of  Lagrangians FORMULA  where FORMULA  for paths FORMULA  on FORMULA 
depending on parameter FORMULA  with weakly regular metrics induces a family
of Euler–Lagrange equations on  FORMULA
FORMULA 
which are equivalent to a corresponding family of “nonlinear” geodesic
equations
FORMULA 
defining paths of a canonical semispray FORMULA  where
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  being inverse to (REF ).

The Theorem REF  states the possibility to geometrize the regular
Lagrange mechanics by geometric objects on nonholonomic spaces and inversely:
Conclusion 2.1 For any family of (semi) Riemannian metrics FORMULA  on
FORMULA  we can associate canonically certain families of effective regular
Lagrange mechanical systems on FORMULA  with the Euler–Lagrange equations
transformed into corresponding families of nonlinear (semispray) geodesic
equations.

Theorem 2.2 Any family of (semi) Riemannian metrics FORMULA  on FORMULA 
induces a corresponding family of canonical N–connection structures on  FORMULA

Proof. We sketch a proof by defining the coefficients of N–connection, see (REF ),
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  and FORMULA  defined respectively by
formulas (REF ) and (REF ).  FORMULA
The families of N–adapted partial derivative and differential operators,
see Appendix for more general formulas (REF ) and (REF ), are
defined by the N–connection coefficients (REF ) and may be denoted
respectively FORMULA  and  FORMULA
For any metric structure FORMULA  on a manifold, there is the unique
metric compatible and torsionless Levi Civita connection FORMULA  for which
FORMULA  and FORMULA  This
connection is not a d–connection because it does not preserve under
parallelism the N–connection splitting (REF ). One has to
consider less constrained cases, admitting nonzero torsion coefficients,
when a d–connection is constructed canonically for a d–metric structure. A
simple minimal metric compatible extension of FORMULA  is that of canonical
d–connection FORMULA  with FORMULA  and FORMULA  but, FORMULA in general, nonzero FORMULA  and FORMULA 
see (REF ). The coefficient formulas for such connections are given
in Appendix, see (REF ) and related discussion. It should be noted
that on tangent bundle FORMULA  it is possible to define the torsionless
canonical d–connection (REF ) which is completely similar to
the Levi Civita connection. For families of metrics FORMULA  we
get certain families of connections FORMULA  and  FORMULA
Theorem 2.3 Any family of (semi) Riemannian metrics FORMULA  on FORMULA 
 induces a parametrized by FORMULA  family of nonholonomic (semi) Riemannian
structures on  FORMULA

Proof. The family FORMULA  on FORMULA  induces a family of
canonical d–metric structures on  FORMULA
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  are elongated as in (REF ), but
with FORMULA  from (REF ). Then, we note that there are canonical d–connections on FORMULA  induced by FORMULA  we can construct them in explicit form by introducing FORMULA  and FORMULA  in formulas (REF ), in order to compute the coefficients  FORMULA
The corresponding curvature curvature tensor
FORMULA 
can be computed by introducing respectively the values FORMULA  and FORMULA  into (REF ), defining FORMULA  and
then into formulas (REF ). Here one should be noted that the
constructions on FORMULA  depend on arbitrary vielbein coefficients FORMULA  in (REF ). We can restrict such
sets of coefficients in order to generate various particular classes of
(semi) Riemannian geometries on FORMULA  for instance, in order to generate
symmetric Riemannian spaces with constant curvature, see Refs. {{cite:f28bb569-85d3-43f7-8c9b-9eebc0dc7b10}}, {{cite:30b710ac-9e53-43e0-9772-115a1f8ba401}}, {{cite:7c9330fc-49e4-4847-afbd-6832d59dd2da}}.
Corollary 2.1 There are lifts of a family of (semi) Riemannian metric FORMULA  on FORMULA  FORMULA  generating a corresponding family
Riemannian structures on FORMULA  with the curvature coefficients of the
canonical d–connections coinciding (with respect to N–adapted bases) to
those for the families of Riemannian space of constant curvature of
dimension  FORMULA

Proof. For a given set FORMULA  on FORMULA  in (REF ), we
chose such coefficients FORMULA  that
FORMULA 
results in (REF ) of type
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  are metrics of symmetric Riemannian space
(of constant curvature). Considering a prescribed set FORMULA  we have to integrate two times on FORMULA  in order to find
any solution for FORMULA  defining a frame structure
in the vertical subspace. The next step is to construct the d–metric FORMULA  of type (REF ), in our case, with respect to a
nonholonomic base elongated by FORMULA 
generated by FORMULA  and FORMULA  like in (REF ) and (REF ). This defines a
constant curvature Riemannian space of dimension FORMULA  The coefficients of
the canonical d–connection, which in this case coincide with those for the
Levi Civita connection, and the coefficients of the Riemannian curvature can
be computed respectively by introducing FORMULA  in formulas (REF ) and (REF ). Finally,
we note that the induced symmetric Riemannian spaces contain additional
geometric structures like the N–connection and anholonomy coefficients FORMULA  see (REF ). FORMULA
There are various possibilities to generate on FORMULA  nonholonomic Riemannian
structures from a given set FORMULA  on FORMULA  They
result in different geometrical and physical models.
Remark 2.1 We can simplify substantially the geometric constructions if
instead of families of constant coefficients FORMULA 
we consider only one set of constant coefficients FORMULA  This is possible even FORMULA  have quite general dependencies on FORMULA  but
supposing that we can define such FORMULA  when (REF ) can be solved for a fixed right side. For simplicity, in our
furhter considerations we shall fix any set FORMULA  and
parametrize the dependencies on FORMULA  for FORMULA  and  FORMULA

In this work, we emphasize the possibility of generating spaces with
constant curvature because for such symmetric spaces it was elaborated a
bi–Hamiltonian approach and corresponding solitonic hierarchies {{cite:ef487ffe-622a-4fd0-b4b2-099f42e5615c}}, {{cite:107a017f-4fd6-477a-afa1-442671037c9d}}, {{cite:1a7aaaf9-f592-4597-ad03-da2e5f53515d}}, {{cite:08d49a84-2e92-419e-8a63-4f8fed3c0c54}}. For general Riemannian and/or Finsler–Lagrange
spaces it is not possible to get constant coefficient curvature coefficients
for the Levi Civita connection but for the corresponding lifts to the
canonical d–connection there are constructions generating constant
curvature coefficients {{cite:9bdd082b-47ac-402b-8491-026f8db7a3d6}}, {{cite:036ee834-ceda-4d97-aed6-c66506202b38}}. This will allow us to construct the
corresponding solitonic hierarchies from which, by imposing the
corresponding constraints, it will be possible to extract the information
for very general classes of metrics.
Example 2.1 The simplest example when a Riemannian structure with constant matrix
curvature coefficients is generated on FORMULA  is given by a d–metric induced
by FORMULA  i.e.
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  defined by FORMULA  in their turn
induced by a given set FORMULA  on FORMULA  For families of
geometric objects, we consider
FORMULA 
when FORMULA  are defined by a given set  FORMULA

For more general nonholonomic configurations on FORMULA  we can consider
families of metrics of type
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
and FORMULA  are elongated by FORMULA  We note that in the
formulas defining the coefficients of the metrics (REF ) one does not
consider summation on repeating indices which are not ”cross” one, i.e. FORMULA  FORMULA  means a simple product FORMULA  FORMULA  between deformation function FORMULA  and metric
coefficient FORMULA  for any fixed values FORMULA  or FORMULA  It
is possible to write down the metrics (REF ) in ”generic
off–diagonal forms”, see (REF ) and (REF ), for any fixed
value of  FORMULA

Nonholonomic Ricci flows and Einstein spaces
In the theory of Ricci flows, the families of metrics (REF ) must
satisfy certain evolution equations on parameter FORMULA  For normalized
(holonomic) Ricci flows {{cite:1893c7c2-0995-4562-aad5-8f879544f07d}}, {{cite:1fa7b337-ad0e-4a2b-bb9a-b6a255a41bfc}}, {{cite:0511851e-f928-4a78-9b7b-cf271720d2f3}}, {{cite:b8124a5d-fec4-4a0c-a1d9-cf78cef7d2c8}}, with respect
to a coordinate base FORMULA  the evolution equations are postulated in the form
FORMULA 
where the normalizing factor FORMULA  is introduced in
order to preserve the volume FORMULA  and the metric coefficients FORMULA  are parametrized in the form (REF ),
and FORMULA  is the Ricci
tensor for the the Levi Civita connection FORMULA  In Refs. {{cite:e09e6678-a643-4110-b533-4ea8d6d5aeac}}, {{cite:a00081af-b241-4deb-be65-ec99ac184c50}}, {{cite:65879e11-0bad-41e6-9109-1698c999d777}} we discuss in details the N–anholonomic Ricci flows
and prove that the nonholonomic version of (REF ) can be proven by a
N–adapted calculus from the Perelman's functionals,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  We note that the equations () constrain
nonholonomic Ricci flows to result in symmetric metrics and that we wrote
them with respect to N–adapted frames. A simple class of solutions can be
constructed for the families of N–anholonomic Einstein spaces when
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
Such equations define some effective Einstein metrics subjected to Ricci
flows under evolution of the N–anholonomic structure FORMULA  correlated
with the evolutions of h–metric FORMULA  but FORMULA  stated for a fixed
value of  FORMULA
For our further considerations, we need the results of two Corollaries (see
Refs. {{cite:1fa7b337-ad0e-4a2b-bb9a-b6a255a41bfc}}, {{cite:e09e6678-a643-4110-b533-4ea8d6d5aeac}}, {{cite:a00081af-b241-4deb-be65-ec99ac184c50}} for detailed proofs and discussions both
for holonomic and nonholonomic manifolds):
Corollary 2.2 The evolution, for all FORMULA  of
preferred frames on a N–anholonomic manifold
FORMULA 
is defined by the coefficients
FORMULA 
with
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  establish the signature of
FORMULA  is given by equations
FORMULA 

For simplicity, we omit formulas for h- and v–decomposition of (REF ).
Corollary 2.3 The scalar curvature (REF )
FORMULA 
for the canonical d–connection on FORMULA  satisfies the evolution equations
FORMULA 

Proof. It is similar to that for the Levi Civita connection because on FORMULA  the
coefficients of canonical d–connection with respect to N-adapted frames are
the same as those for the Levi Civita but decomposed into h– and
v–components. We note that on FORMULA  the Ricci d–tensor FORMULA  is symmetric which does not hold true for a general
nonholonomic manifold or vector bundle, see formulas (REF ). The
evolution equations (REF ) consist a particular case of more general
formulas for Ricci flows on N–anholonomic manifolds proved in Theorem 4.1
of Ref. {{cite:e09e6678-a643-4110-b533-4ea8d6d5aeac}} (on FORMULA  the distorsion tensor transforming the FORMULA  into FORMULA  is zero). FORMULA
Finally, in this section, we note that a number of geometric ideas and
methods applied in this section were considered in the approaches to the
geometry of nonholonomic spaces and generalized Finsler–Lagrange geometry
elaborated by the schools of G. Vranceanu and R. Miron and by A. Bejancu in
Romania {{cite:23c6e42a-f65c-460b-98c0-1f138b8c12e4}}, {{cite:952e2339-0df1-4bdf-bfcb-d603635639c1}}, {{cite:97660bbd-af2a-4f72-9fa0-84a162bed888}}, {{cite:80a8179e-a641-418a-9f4e-35710c1599f4}}, {{cite:7405b234-de60-483c-8e71-1ebd718784b5}}, {{cite:de2a088e-14c9-4c3c-a46e-688fc1b478c9}}. We emphasize that this way it
is possible to construct geometric models with metric compatible linear
connections which is important for elaborating standard approaches in modern
(non)commutative gravity and string theory {{cite:4d54e505-a4bc-427a-a87e-b6339c0a3b5a}}, {{cite:3438d6f9-d64e-4409-a2da-77b241d06b44}}. For Finsler
spaces with nontrivial nonmetricity, for instance, for those defined by the
the Berwald and Chern connections, see details in {{cite:f4824be8-96e7-4328-811c-e6504466f2eb}}, the physical
theories with local anisotropy are not imbedded into the class of standard
models. It is also a more cumbersome task to elaborate a theory of Ricci
flows of noncompatible metrics and connection structures.

N–Adapted Curve Flows in Vector Bundles
We formulate the geometry of curve flows adapted to the nonlinear connection
structures constructed by certain classes of canonical lifts from the base
space and nonholonomic frame deformations resulting into constant curvature
coefficients for the canonical d–connection. The case of tangent bundles
will be emphasized as a special one when both FORMULA  and FORMULA  can be torsionless.
Non–stretching and N–adapted curve flows
Let us consider a vector bundle FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA 
(in a particular case, FORMULA  when FORMULA  provided with a d–metric FORMULA  (REF ) and N–connection FORMULA  (REF )
structures. A non–stretching curve FORMULA  on FORMULA  where FORMULA  is a parameter and FORMULA  is the arclength
of the curve on FORMULA  is defined with such evolution
d–vector FORMULA  and tangent d–vector FORMULA  that
FORMULA 
The curve FORMULA  swept out a two–dimensional surface
in FORMULA  If the
geometric objects evolve as Ricci flows on parameter FORMULA  we get an
additional parameter for the geometric objects like connections and metrics
and the non–stretching condition (REF ) transforms into FORMULA  for a family of d–metrics FORMULA 
FORMULA  and FORMULA  which can be
satisfied by certain families of curves, FORMULA  (briefly, we shall write only
FORMULA  and related curve evolution and tangent
vectors, FORMULA  and  FORMULA
We work with families of N–adapted bases (REF ) and (REF )
and the connection 1–forms FORMULA  (equivalently, FORMULA  with the coefficients FORMULA  FORMULA 
for the canonical d–connection operator FORMULA  FORMULA  (REF ) acting in the form
FORMULA 
where ”FORMULA  denotes the interior product and the indices
are lowered and raised respectively by the d–metric FORMULA  and its inverse FORMULA  For simplicity, we shall omit the Ricci flow parameter if it does not result
in ambiguities. We note that FORMULA  is the covariant
derivation operator along curve FORMULA  It is
convenient to orient the N–adapted frames to be parallel respectively to
curves  FORMULA
FORMULA 
for FORMULA  and FORMULA  For such
frames, the covariant derivatives of each ”normal” d–vectors FORMULA  result into the d–vectors adapted to  FORMULA
FORMULA 
which holds for certain classes of functions FORMULA  and FORMULA  The formulas (REF ) and (REF ) are distinguished into h– and
v–components for FORMULA 
and FORMULA  for FORMULA  where
FORMULA  and  FORMULA
Along any curve FORMULA  we can move differential forms in a
parallel N–adapted form. For instance, FORMULA 
which for families of d–objects is to be written FORMULA  The algebraic
characterization of such spaces, can be obtained if we perform a frame
transform preserving the decomposition (REF ) to an
orthonormalized basis FORMULA  when
FORMULA 
called orthonormal d–basis (family of d–bases). In this case, the
coefficients of the d–metric (REF ) transform into the Euclidean ones,
FORMULA  (we can define such frame transform (REF ) when
the the same constant coefficients for d–metric are generated for all
values of parameter FORMULA  for such configurations, we do not emphasize
the labels/dependencies on Ricci flow parameter which are present in
d–connection operators and N–connection coefficients). In distinguished
form, we obtain families of two skew matrices
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
we omitted the Ricci flow label performing the constructions according
Remark REF , and
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  and FORMULA  being respectively FORMULA  and FORMULA  matrices. The above presented
row–matrices and skew–matrices show that locally an total space of a
vector bundle of dimension FORMULA  with respect to distinguished
orthonormalized frames are characterized algebraically by couples of unit
vectors in FORMULA  and FORMULA  preserved respectively by
the FORMULA  and FORMULA  rotation subgroups of the local N–adapted frame
structure group FORMULA  The connection matrices FORMULA  and FORMULA 
belong to the orthogonal complements of the corresponding Lie subalgebras
and algebras, FORMULA  and  FORMULA
The torsion (REF ) and curvature (REF ) tensors can be in
orthonormalized component form with respect to (REF ) mapped
into a distinguished orthotnomalized dual frame (REF ),
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  define
respectively the N–adapted orthonormalized frame row–matrix and the
canonical d–connection skew–matrix in the flow directs, and FORMULA  FORMULA  is the curvature matrix. Both
torsion and curvature components can be distinguished in h– and
v–components like (REF ) and (REF ), by considering
N–adapted decompositions of type
FORMULA 
Finally, we note that the matrices for torsion (REF ) and curvature (REF ) can be computed for any families, parametrized by FORMULA 
metric compatible linear connection like the Levi Civita and the canonical
d–connection. For our purposes, in this work, we are interested to define
such a frame of reference with respect to which the curvature tensor has
constant coefficients and the torsion tensor vanishes.

N–anholonomic bundles with constant matrix curvature
For vanishing N–connection torsion and constant matrix curvature of the
canonical d–connection, we get couples of holonomic Riemannian manifolds
and the equations (REF ) and (REF ) directly encode couples
of bi–Hamiltonian structures, see details in Refs. {{cite:9bdd082b-47ac-402b-8491-026f8db7a3d6}}, {{cite:036ee834-ceda-4d97-aed6-c66506202b38}}, {{cite:107a017f-4fd6-477a-afa1-442671037c9d}}, {{cite:1a7aaaf9-f592-4597-ad03-da2e5f53515d}}, {{cite:08d49a84-2e92-419e-8a63-4f8fed3c0c54}}. A well known class of Riemannian manifolds for
which the frame curvature matrix constant consists of the symmetric spaces FORMULA  for compact semisimple Lie groups FORMULA  A complete
classification and summary of main results on such spaces are given in Refs. {{cite:f28bb569-85d3-43f7-8c9b-9eebc0dc7b10}}, {{cite:30b710ac-9e53-43e0-9772-115a1f8ba401}}, {{cite:7c9330fc-49e4-4847-afbd-6832d59dd2da}}.
We suppose that the base manifold is a symmetric space FORMULA  with the
isotropy subgroup FORMULA  and the typical fiber space to be a
symmetric space FORMULA  with the isotropy subgroup FORMULA  This means that FORMULA  and FORMULA  which is enough for a
study of real holonomic and nonholonomic manifolds and geometric mechanics
models.it is necessary to consider FORMULA  and FORMULA  for the geometric
models with spinor and gauge fields
Our aim is to solder in a canonic way (like in the N–connection geometry)
the horizontal and vertical symmetric Riemannian spaces of dimension FORMULA  and
FORMULA  with a (total) symmetric Riemannian space FORMULA  of dimension FORMULA  when FORMULA  with the isotropy group FORMULA  and FORMULA  We note that for the just mentioned horizontal, vertical and
total symmetric Riemannian spaces one exists natural settings to Klein
geometry. For instance, the metric tensor FORMULA  on a
symmetric Riemannian space FORMULA  is defined by the Cartan–Killing inner
product FORMULA  on FORMULA  restricted to
the Lie algebra quotient spaces FORMULA 
with FORMULA  where FORMULA  is stated such that there is an involutive automorphism of FORMULA  under FORMULA  is fixed, i.e. FORMULA  FORMULA  and FORMULA  In
a similar form, we can define the group spaces and related inner products
and Lie algebras,
FORMULA 
We parametrize the metric structure with constant coefficients on FORMULA  in the form
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  are local coordinates and
FORMULA 
when trivial, constant, N–connection coefficients are computed FORMULA  for any given sets FORMULA  and FORMULA  i.e. from the inverse metrics coefficients
defined respectively on FORMULA  and by off–blocks FORMULA – and FORMULA –terms of the metric FORMULA  As a
result, we define an equivalent d–metric structure of type (REF )
FORMULA 
defining a trivial FORMULA –splitting FORMULA because all
nonholonomy coefficients FORMULA  and
N–connection curvature coefficients FORMULA  are zero.
In more general form, we can consider any covariant coordinate transforms of
(REF ) preserving the FORMULA –splitting resulting in any FORMULA  (REF ) and FORMULA  (REF ). It should be noted that even such trivial parametrizations define
algebraic classifications of  symmetric Riemannian spaces of dimension FORMULA 
with constant matrix curvature admitting splitting (by certain algebraic
constraints) into symmetric Riemannian subspaces of dimension FORMULA  and FORMULA 
also both with constant matrix curvature and introducing the concept of
N–anholonomic Riemannian space of type FORMULA 
FORMULA  One can be considered that such
trivially N–anholonomic group spaces have possess a Lie d–algebra symmetry
 FORMULA
The simplest generalization on a vector bundle FORMULA  is to
consider nonhlonomic distributions on FORMULA  defined locally by
families of N–connection coefficients FORMULA  with
nonvanishing FORMULA  and FORMULA  but with constant d–metric coefficients when
FORMULA 
This family of metric is very similar to (REF ) but with the
coefficients FORMULA  and FORMULA  induced by
the corresponding Lie d–algebra structure FORMULA  Such spaces transform into families of N–anholonomic
Riemann–Cartan manifolds FORMULA  FORMULA  with nontrivial N–connection curvature and induced
d–torsion coefficients of the canonical d–connection (see formulas (REF ) computed for constant d–metric coefficients and the canonical
d–connection coefficients in (REF )). One has zero curvature for
the canonical d–connection (in general, such spaces are curved ones with
generic off–diagonal metric (REF ) and nonzero curvature tensor for
the Levi Civita connection).Introducing, constant values for the d–metric coefficients we get zero
coefficients for the canonical d–connection which in its turn results in
zero values of (REF ). This allows us to classify the
N–anholonomic manifolds (and vector bundles) as having the same group and
algebraic structures of couples of symmetric Riemannian spaces of dimension FORMULA  and FORMULA  but nonholonomically soldered to the symmetric Riemannian space
of dimension FORMULA  With respect to N–adapted orthonormal bases (REF ), with distinguished h– and v–subspaces, we obtain the same
inner products and group and Lie algebra spaces as in (REF ).
The classification of N–anholonomic vector bundles is almost similar to
that for symmetric Riemannian spaces if we consider that FORMULA  and try to
model tangent bundles of such spaces, provided with N–connection structure.
For instance, we can take a (semi) Riemannian structure with the
N–connection induced by a absolute energy structure like in (REF )
and with the canonical d–connection structure (REF ), for FORMULA  like in (REF ). A straightforward
computation of the canonical d–connection coefficientson tangent bundles, such d–connections can be defined to be torsionless
and of d–curvatures for FORMULA  and FORMULA  proves that the nonholonomic Riemanian manifold FORMULA  possess constant both zero
canonical d–connection curvature and torsion but with induced
nontrivial N–connection curvature FORMULA 
Such spaces, being tangent to symmetric Riemannian spaces, are classified
similarly to the Riemannian ones with constant matrix curvature, see (REF ) for FORMULA  but provided with a nonholonomic structure induced by
generating function FORMULA  We can introduce Ricci flows
on parameter FORMULA  when for certain systems of coordinates the metric
coefficients are constant but satisfy the evolution equations (REF )
and (REF ).

Basic Equations for N–anholonomic Curve Flows
Introducing N–adapted orthonormalized bases, for N–anholonomic spaces of
dimension FORMULA  with constant curvatures of the canonical d–connection, we
can derive bi–Hamiltonian and vector soliton structures similarly to {{cite:08d49a84-2e92-419e-8a63-4f8fed3c0c54}}, {{cite:1a7aaaf9-f592-4597-ad03-da2e5f53515d}}, {{cite:107a017f-4fd6-477a-afa1-442671037c9d}}. In symbolic, abstract index form, the constructions for
nonholonomic vector bundles are similar to those for the Riemannian
symmetric–spaces soldered to Klein geometry. We have to distinguish the
horizontal and vertical components of geometric objects and related
equations. The previous bi–Hamiltonian and solitonic constructions were for
an extrinsic approach soldering the Riemannian symmetric–space geometry to
the Klein geometry {{cite:7c9330fc-49e4-4847-afbd-6832d59dd2da}}. For the N–anhlonomic spaces of dimension
FORMULA  with constant d–curvatures, similar constructions hold true but we
have to adapt them to the N–connection structure, see Appendix .
There is an isomorphism between the real space FORMULA  and the
Lie algebra of FORMULA  skew–symmetric matrices. This allows us to
establish an isomorphism between FORMULA  FORMULA  and
the tangent spaces FORMULA  FORMULA  of the
Riemannian manifold FORMULA  FORMULA  as described by the following
canonical decomposition
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  being the
h–component of the d–vector FORMULA  and FORMULA  mean the transposition of
the row FORMULA  The Cartan–Killing inner product on FORMULA 
is stated following the rule
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  denotes the trace of the corresponding product of matrices. This
product identifies canonically FORMULA  FORMULA  with
its dual FORMULA  FORMULA  In a similar form,
we can consider
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  being the
v–component of the d–vector FORMULA  and define the Cartan–Killing inner product FORMULA  In general, in
the tangent bundle of a N–anholonomic manifold, we can consider the
Cartan–Killing N–adapted inner product  FORMULA
Following the introduced Cartan–Killing parametrizations, we analyze the
flow FORMULA  of a non–stretching curve in FORMULA  FORMULA  Let us introduce a family of
coframes FORMULA  which is a N–adapted FORMULA –parallel basis along FORMULA  and its
associated canonical d–connection 1–form FORMULA  Such d–objects are respectively parametrized:
FORMULA 
for
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
where we write FORMULA  and  FORMULA
FORMULA 
for
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
The above parametrizations are fixed in order to preserve the FORMULA  and FORMULA  rotation gauge freedoms on the N–adapted coframe and canonical
d–connection 1–form, distinguished in h- and v–components.
There are defined decompositions of horizontal FORMULA  FORMULA  matrices
like
FORMULA 
into tangential and normal parts relative to FORMULA  via
corresponding decompositions of h–vectors FORMULA  relative to FORMULA  when FORMULA  is identified with FORMULA  and FORMULA  is identified with FORMULA  In a similar form, it is
possible to decompose vertical FORMULA  FORMULA  matrices,
FORMULA 
into tangential and normal parts relative to FORMULA  via
corresponding decompositions of h–vectors FORMULA  relative to FORMULA  when FORMULA  is identified with FORMULA  and
FORMULA  is identified with  FORMULA
The canonical d–connection induces matrices decomposed with respect to the
flow direction. In the h–direction, we parametrize
FORMULA 
when FORMULA  and FORMULA  and
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
In the v–direction, we parametrize
FORMULA 
when FORMULA 
and FORMULA  and
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
The components FORMULA  and FORMULA  correspond to the decomposition
FORMULA 
into tangential and normal parts relative to FORMULA  In a similar form, one considers FORMULA  and FORMULA  corresponding to the
decomposition
FORMULA 
Using the above stated matrix parametrizations, we get
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
We can use formulas (REF ) and (REF ) in order to write the
structure equations (REF ) and (REF ) in terms of N–adapted
curve flow operators soldered to the geometry Klein N–anholonomic spaces
using the relations (REF ). One obtains respectively the FORMULA –invariant N–adapted torsion and curvature generated by the canonical
d–connection,
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA  and FORMULA  The formulas (REF ) and (REF ) are equivalent, respectively, to (REF ) and (REF ). In general, FORMULA  and FORMULA  can not be defined to have constant matrix coefficients with
respect to a N–adapted basis. For N–anholonomic spaces with dimensions FORMULA  we have FORMULA  and FORMULA  defined by constant, or vanishing, d–curvature coefficients
(see discussions related to formulas (REF ) and (REF )). For such cases, we can consider the h– and v–components of (REF ) and (REF ) in a similar manner as for symmetric
Riemannian spaces but with the canonical d–connection instead of the Levi
Civita one. One obtains, respectively,
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
Following the N–adapted curve flow parametrizations (REF ) and (REF ), the equations (REF ) and (REF ) are written
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
The tensor and interior products, for instance, for the h–components, are
defined in the form: FORMULA  denotes the outer product of pairs of
vectors (FORMULA  row matrices), producing FORMULA  matrices FORMULA  and FORMULA  denotes multiplication of FORMULA 
matrices on vectors (FORMULA  row matrices); one holds the properties FORMULA  which is the transpose of the standard matrix product on
column vectors, and FORMULA  Here we note that similar formulas hold for the
v–components but, for instance, we have to change, correspondingly, FORMULA  and  FORMULA
The variables FORMULA  and FORMULA  written in
h– and v–components, can be expressed corresponding in terms of variables FORMULA  and FORMULA  (see respectively the first two equations in (REF ) and the last two equations in (REF )),
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
Substituting these values, correspondingly, in the last two equations in (REF ) and in the first two equations in (REF ), we
express
FORMULA 
contained in the h– and v–flow equations respectively on FORMULA  and FORMULA  considered as scalar components when FORMULA  and  FORMULA
FORMULA 
where the scalar curvatures of the canonical d–connection, FORMULA  and FORMULA  are defined by formulas (REF ). For
symmetric Riemannian spaces like FORMULA  the value FORMULA  is just the scalar curvature FORMULA  see {{cite:08d49a84-2e92-419e-8a63-4f8fed3c0c54}}. On tangent bundles, it is possible that FORMULA  and FORMULA  are certain zero or nonzero constants with the h–part
equivalent to the base scalar curvature.
For Ricci flows of geometric objects, the curve flow evolution equations (REF ) contain additional dependencies on parameter  FORMULA
FORMULA 
where the scalar curvatures evolve following formulas (REF ) for
Ricci flows.
The above presented considerations consist the proof of
Lemma 4.1 There are canonical lifts of Ricci flows from a (semi)
Riemannian manfiold FORMULA  to FORMULA  when certain families of constant constant
curvature matrix coefficients for the canonical d–connections define
families of N–adapted Hamiltonian sympletic operators,
FORMULA 
and cosympletic operators
FORMULA 
where, for instance, FORMULA   FORMULA

For any fixed value FORMULA  the formulas for this Lemma transform
into similar ones from Ref. {{cite:9bdd082b-47ac-402b-8491-026f8db7a3d6}}. The properties of operators (REF ) and (REF ) are defined by
Theorem 4.1 The Ricci flows of d–operators FORMULA  and FORMULA  FORMULA are defined respectively by FORMULA –invariant
Hamiltonian sympletic and cosympletic d–operators with respect to the
corresponding Hamiltonian d–variables FORMULA  Such

Proof. One follows from the Lemma REF , Corollaries REF  and REF  and (REF ). In a detailed form, for holonomic structures,
it is given in Ref. {{cite:107a017f-4fd6-477a-afa1-442671037c9d}} and discussed in {{cite:08d49a84-2e92-419e-8a63-4f8fed3c0c54}}.  FORMULA
Finally, we note that for any fixed value FORMULA  we get a Theorem from {{cite:9bdd082b-47ac-402b-8491-026f8db7a3d6}}, on curve flows in symmetric Riemannian spaces, which has
generalizations for curve flows on generalized Lagrange and Finsler spaces {{cite:036ee834-ceda-4d97-aed6-c66506202b38}}.

Curve Flows and Solitonic Hierarchies for Ricci Flows
The final aim of this paper is to prove that for any nonholonomic Ricci flow
system  we can define naturally a family of N–adapted bi–Hamiltonian flow
hierarchies inducing anholonomic solitonic configurations.
Formulation of the main theorem
Following a usual solitonic techniques generalized for N–anholonomic
spaces, see details in Ref. {{cite:9bdd082b-47ac-402b-8491-026f8db7a3d6}}, {{cite:036ee834-ceda-4d97-aed6-c66506202b38}}, {{cite:1a7aaaf9-f592-4597-ad03-da2e5f53515d}}, {{cite:08d49a84-2e92-419e-8a63-4f8fed3c0c54}}, the recursion
h–operators from (REF ),
FORMULA 
generate a  family of horizontal hierarchies of commuting Hamiltonian
vector fields FORMULA  starting
from FORMULA  given by the infinitesimal generator of FORMULA –translations in terms of arclength FORMULA  along the curve
(we use a boldface FORMULA  in order to emphasized that the curve is on
a N–anholonomic manifold when the geometric objects are subjected to Ricci
flows). A family of vertical hierarchies of commuting vector fields FORMULA  starting from FORMULA  FORMULA  is generated by the recursion v–operators

presented considerations, we prove
Corollary 5.1  There are Ricci flow families of N–adapted hierarchies of
distinguished horizontal and vertical commuting bi–Hamiltonian flows,
correspondingly, on FORMULA  and FORMULA  associated
to the recursion d–operator (REF ) given by families of FORMULA  –invariant d–vector h–evolution equations,

FORMULA 
and with  families of vertical Hamiltonians
FORMULA 
for FORMULA  The Ricci flows of d–operators FORMULA  and
FORMULA  FORMULA  are N–adapted and mutually compatible from which we
can construct a family of alternative (explicit) Hamilton d–operators
FORMULA 

The Main Result of this work is formulated in the form:
Theorem 5.1  For any vector/tangent bundle with Ricci flows of d–metric
structures, one can be defined a family of hierarchies of bi-Hamiltonian
N–adapted flows of curves FORMULA 
described by families of geometric nonholonomic map equations:
The 0 flows are defined as convective (travelling wave) maps
FORMULA 
There are families of +1 flows defined as Ricci flows of non–stretching
mKdV maps
FORMULA 
and the families of +2,...flows as higher order analogs.
There are also families of -1 flows defined by the kernels of recursion
operators (REF ) and (REF ) inducing non–stretching maps
FORMULA 

Proof is outlined in Appendix .

Nonholonomic mKdV and SG hierarchies
Let us consider some explicit constructions when families of solitonic
hierarchies are derived following the conditions of Theorem REF .
The h–flow and v–flow equations resulting from (REF ) are
FORMULA 
when, respectively,
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
The d–flow equations possess horizontal and vertical conservation laws
FORMULA 
for FORMULA  and
FORMULA 
for FORMULA  This corresponds to
FORMULA 
In general, such laws are more sophisticate than those on (semi) Riemannian
spaces because of nonholonomic constraints resulting in non–symmetric Ricci
tensors and different types of identities. But for the geometries modelled
for dimensions FORMULA  with canonical d–connections, we get similar h– and
v–components of the conservation law equations as on symmetric Riemannian
spaces.We note that the problem of formulating conservation laws on
N–anholonomic spaces (in particular, on nonholonomic vector bundles) in
analyzed in Ref. {{cite:3438d6f9-d64e-4409-a2da-77b241d06b44}}.
It is possible to rescale conformally the variable FORMULA  and obtain FORMULA  FORMULA  and (it can
be for other rescale) FORMULA  i.e.
FORMULA 
We can express FORMULA  and FORMULA  in terms of FORMULA  and its derivatives and, similarly, we can express FORMULA  and FORMULA  in
terms of FORMULA  and its derivatives, which
follows from (REF ). The N–adapted wave map equations describing
the -1 flows reduce to a system of two independent nonlocal evolution
equations for the h– and v–components, parametrized by  FORMULA
FORMULA 
For N–anholonomic spaces of constant scalar d–curvatures, we can rescale
the equations on FORMULA  to the case when the terms FORMULA  and FORMULA  are constant, and the
evolution equations transform into a system of hyperbolic d–vector
equations,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are usual partial
derivatives on direction FORMULA  with FORMULA  and FORMULA  considered as scalar functions for the covariant derivatives FORMULA  and FORMULA 
defined by the canonical d–connection. It also follows that FORMULA  and FORMULA  obey corresponding vector sine–Gordon (SG) equations
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
The above presented formulas and Corollary REF  imply
Conclusion 5.1 The Ricci flow families of recursion d–operators FORMULA  (REF ), see (REF ) and (REF ), generate two hierarchies
of vector mKdV symmetries: the first one is horizontal,
FORMULA 
with all such terms commuting with the -1 flow
FORMULA 
associated to the vector SG equation (REF ); the second one is
vertical,
FORMULA 
with all such terms commuting with the -1 flow
FORMULA 
associated to the vector SG equation (REF ).

In its turn, using the above Conclusion, we derive that the family of
adjoint d–operators FORMULA  generates corresponding families of horizontal hierarchies
of Hamiltonians (for simplicity, here we omit labels/dependences on FORMULA ),
FORMULA 
and of vertical hierarchies of Hamiltonians
FORMULA 
all of which are conserved densities for respective horizontal and vertical
-1 flows and determining higher conservation laws for the corresponding
hyperbolic equations (REF ) and (REF ).
The above presented horizontal equations (REF ), (REF ), (REF ) and (REF ) and of vertical equations (REF ), (REF ), (REF ) and (REF ) have similar mKdV scaling
symmetries but on different parameters FORMULA  and FORMULA 
because, in general, there are two independent values of scalar curvatures FORMULA  and FORMULA  see (REF ). The
horizontal scaling symmetries are FORMULA  and FORMULA  for FORMULA  For the vertical scaling symmetries, one has
FORMULA  and FORMULA  for  FORMULA
Finally, we disucss how exact solutions for the Einstein equations
FORMULA 
can be extracted from Ricci flows of solitonic hierarchies (such spaces with
nonhomogeneous effective constants FORMULA  were
examined in details in Refs. {{cite:3438d6f9-d64e-4409-a2da-77b241d06b44}}, {{cite:4d54e505-a4bc-427a-a87e-b6339c0a3b5a}}, for exact solutions in
gravity, and {{cite:a00081af-b241-4deb-be65-ec99ac184c50}}, {{cite:8c291982-ce0d-4401-9dff-2eb7a9b0d7cc}}, {{cite:fb66176a-9e82-4a86-ae15-144aff34ae6d}}, {{cite:29e789ff-d73c-4b53-aae3-e478eafdc226}}, for exact solutions and
applications in physics of the nonholonomic Ricci flow theory).
Corollary 5.2 Ricci flows of nonhomogeneous Einstein spaces, of signature FORMULA  defined by (REF ) are can be extracted from
solitonic hierarchies satisfying the conditions of Theorem REF  by
certain classes of constraints for
FORMULA 
solving the equations
FORMULA 
and evolution of N–adapted frames stated by formulas
FORMULA 

Proof. The equations (REF ) folow from equations (REF ) and (REF ), see also (REF ), when hold true (REF ). The equation
(REF ) is a consequence of (REF ). Similar proofs can be
provided for different signatures of metrics.  FORMULA
The vacuum equations in Einstein gravity can be parametrized as solitonic
hierarchies with constant on FORMULA  N–anholonomic frames, see (REF ).
The corresponding SG hierarchies are defined as solutions of the equations (REF ) and (REF ) and (REF ), with constant scalar
curvature and frame coefficients.

Conclusion
In summary, we have considered a geometric formalism of encoding general
(semi) Riemannian metrics and their lifts to tangent bundles into families
of nonholonomic hierarchies of bi–Hamiltonian structures and related
solitonic equations derived for curve flows on tangent spaces. Towards this
ends, we have applied a programme of study that is based on prior works on
nonholonomic Ricci {{cite:e09e6678-a643-4110-b533-4ea8d6d5aeac}}, {{cite:a00081af-b241-4deb-be65-ec99ac184c50}} and curve flows {{cite:9bdd082b-47ac-402b-8491-026f8db7a3d6}}, {{cite:036ee834-ceda-4d97-aed6-c66506202b38}}. The
premise of this methodology is that one can derive solitonic hierarchies
for non–stretching curve flows on constant curvature Riemannian spaces {{cite:e1743214-cfbe-491c-8740-00d15bedb5fc}}, {{cite:ef487ffe-622a-4fd0-b4b2-099f42e5615c}}, {{cite:107a017f-4fd6-477a-afa1-442671037c9d}}, {{cite:08d49a84-2e92-419e-8a63-4f8fed3c0c54}}. The validity of this approach was
substantiated by the encoding into solitonic hierarchies of arbitrary
(semi) Riemannian and Finsler–Lagrange metrics {{cite:9bdd082b-47ac-402b-8491-026f8db7a3d6}}, {{cite:036ee834-ceda-4d97-aed6-c66506202b38}}.
Our analysis was completed by explicit constructions related to solitonic
encoding of Ricci flow equations {{cite:939a3dc5-65f6-41ec-8c74-c533b5666c8f}}, {{cite:e2c9318d-c689-458b-870b-6f5ac77ba0bb}}, {{cite:1893c7c2-0995-4562-aad5-8f879544f07d}}, {{cite:1735753d-162b-40b0-b181-9e67e0a2f9d2}}, {{cite:bd693ba3-8eda-4eb2-8366-28d5169e1428}}.
First of all, we note that it was not possible to perform such
constructions working only with the Levi Civita connection because, in
general, the curvature tensor for this connection can not be parametrized
by constant coefficients. The idea was to re–define equivalently the
geometric objects and basic Ricci flow and field equations for other
classes of linear connections generated on vector/ tangent bundles and/or
(semi) Riemannian manifolds enabled with certain classes of preferred
frames with associated nonlinear connection (N–connection) structure. In
particular, we elaborated such lifts of (semi) Riemannian metrics to the
tangent bundle when in a canonical form there are defined metric
structures, a class of N–connections and distinguished (d) connections
when with respect to certain classes of N–adapted frames it is possible to
get constant curvature coefficients and zero torsion. Such geometric models
and their lifts to different classes of fibred spaces are related to
effective Lagrangians and, inversely, any regular geometric mechanics can
be encoded into geometric objects on nonholonomic Riemannian manifolds/
tangent bundles.
Secondly, we considered Ricci flows of geometric objects and fundamental
evolution/field equations. We found that a nonholonomically constrained
flow of (semi) Riemannian metrics can result in generalized
Finsler–Lagrange configurations which motivates both application of such
Finsler geometry methods for usual Riemannian spaces if moving frames are
introduced into consideration and a deep study of nonholonomic structures
with associated N–connections soldering couples of Klein spaces and/or
constant curvature Riemannian spaces.
Third, we argued that the geometry Riemann and Finsler–Lagrange spaces
can be encoded into bi–Hamilton structures and nonholonomic solitonic
equations and anticipated that such curve flow – solitonic hierarchies can
be constructed in a similar manner for exact solutions of
Einstein–Yang–Mills–Dirac equations, derived following the anholonomic
frame method, in noncommutative generalizations of gravity and geometry and
possible quantum models based on nonholonomic Lagrange–Fedosov manifolds.
In spite of the fact that there are a number of conceptual and technical
difficulties (such as the physical meaning of the general N–connections,
additionally to the preferred frame systems and nonlinear generalizations
of the usual linear connections, explicit relations of the Ricci flows to
renormalization group flows in quantum gravity models, cumbersome geometric
analysis calculus...) the outcome of such approach is almost obvious that
we can encode nonlinear fundamental field/evolution equations in terms of
corresponding vector solitonic equations, their hierarchies and
conservation laws.
Finally, we tried not only to encode some geometric information about
metrics, connections and frames into solitons but also formulated certain
criteria when from such solitonic equations we can extract vacuum
gravitational spaces or certain more general solutions for the Ricci flow
equations and related Einstein spaces or Euler–Lagrange equations in
geometric mechanics. For more general classes of solutions and extensions
to quantum gravity, noncommutative geometry, these are desirable purposes
for further investigations.

The Geometry of N–anholonomic Vector Bundles
We denote by FORMULA  the differential of map FORMULA  defined by fiber preserving morphisms of the tangent
bundles FORMULA  and FORMULA  The kernel of FORMULA  is just the vertical
subspace FORMULA  with a related inclusion mapping  FORMULA
Definition A.1 A nonlinear connection (N–connection) FORMULA  on a vector bundle FORMULA   is defined by the splitting on the left of an exact sequence
FORMULA 
i. e. by a morphism of submanifolds FORMULA  such
that FORMULA  is the unity in  FORMULA

In an equivalent form, we can say that a N–connection is defined by a
Whitney sum of conventional horizontal (h) subspace, FORMULA 
and vertical (v) subspace,  FORMULA
FORMULA 
This sum defines a nonholonomic (equivalently, anholonomic, or nonitegrable)
distribution of horizontal and vertical subspaces on FORMULA  Locally,
a N–connection is defined by its coefficients  FORMULA
FORMULA 
The well known class of linear connections consists on a particular subclass
with the coefficients being linear on FORMULA  i.e.,  FORMULAWe use ”boldface” symbols if it is necessary to emphasize that any space
and/or geometrical objects are provided/adapted to a N–connection
structure, or with the coefficients computed with respect to N–adapted
frames.
Remark A.1 A bundle space, or a a manifold, is called nonholonomic if it provided with
a nonholonomic distribution (see historical details and summary of results
in {{cite:de2a088e-14c9-4c3c-a46e-688fc1b478c9}}). In particular case, when the nonholonomic distribution is
of type (REF ), such spaces are called N–anholonomic {{cite:3438d6f9-d64e-4409-a2da-77b241d06b44}}.

Any N–connection FORMULA  may be
characterized by a N–adapted frame (vielbein) structure FORMULA  where
FORMULA 
and the dual frame (coframe) structure FORMULA  where
FORMULA 
For any N–connection, we can introduce its N–connection curvature
FORMULA 
with the coefficients defined as the Neijenheuse tensor,
FORMULA 
The vielbeins (REF ) satisfy the nonholonomy (equivalently,
anholonomy) relations
FORMULA 
with (antisymmetric) nontrivial anholonomy coefficients FORMULA  and  FORMULA
The geometric objects can be defined in a form adapted to a N–connection
structure, following decompositions being invariant under parallel
transports preserving the splitting (REF ). In this case we call
them to be distinguished (by the connection structure), i.e. d–objects. For
instance, a vector field FORMULA   is expressed
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  state, respectively, the
adapted to the N–connection structure horizontal (h) and vertical (v)
components of the vector (which following Refs. {{cite:97660bbd-af2a-4f72-9fa0-84a162bed888}}, {{cite:80a8179e-a641-418a-9f4e-35710c1599f4}} is called a
distinguished vector, in brief, d–vector). In a similar fashion, the
geometric objects on FORMULA  for instance, tensors, spinors,
connections, ... are called respectively d–tensors, d–spinors,
d–connections if they are adapted to the N–connection splitting (REF ).
Definition A.2 A distinguished connection (in brief, d–connection) FORMULA  is a linear connection preserving under parallel transports
the nonholonomic decomposition (REF ).

The N–adapted components FORMULA  of
a d–connection FORMULA  are defined by the equations
FORMULA 
The N–adapted splitting into h– and v–covariant derivatives is stated by
FORMULA 
where, by definition, FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA  The components FORMULA  completely
define a d–connection FORMULA  on  FORMULA
The simplest way to perform N–adapted computations is to use differential
forms. For instance, starting with the d–connection 1–form,
FORMULA 
with the coefficients defined with respect to N–elongated frames (REF ) and (REF ), the torsion of a d–connection,
FORMULA 
is characterized by (N–adapted) d–torsion components,
FORMULA 
For d–connection structures on FORMULA  we have to identify indices in the
form FORMULA  and the components of N–
and d–connections, for instance, FORMULA  and  FORMULA
Definition A.3 A distinguished metric (in brief, d–metric) on a vector bundle FORMULA 
is a usual second rank metric tensor FORMULA 
equivalently,
FORMULA 
adapted to the N–connection decomposition (REF ).

With respect to a coordinate basis, the metric FORMULA  (REF ) can
be written in the form
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
From the class of arbitrary d–connections FORMULA  on FORMULA  one
distinguishes those which are metric compatible (metrical) satisfying the
condition
FORMULA 
including all h- and v-projections FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA  For d–metric structures on FORMULA  with FORMULA  the conditions of vanishing
”nonmetricity” (REF ) transform into
FORMULA 
i.e. FORMULA  and  FORMULA
There are two types of preferred linear connections uniquely determined by a
generic off–diagonal metric structure with FORMULA  splitting, see FORMULA :

The Levi Civita connection FORMULA  is by definition torsionless, FORMULA  and
satisfies the metric compatibility condition FORMULA

The canonical d–connection FORMULA  is also metric compatible, i. e. FORMULA  but the torsion vanishes only on h– and
v–subspaces, i.e. FORMULA  and FORMULA 
for certain nontrivial values of FORMULA  For simplicity, we omit hats on symbols and write,
for simplicity, FORMULA  instead of FORMULA  FORMULA 
instead of FORMULA  and so on...but preserve the general
symbols FORMULA  and  FORMULA

With respect to N–adapted frames (REF ) and (REF ), we can
verify that the requested properties for FORMULA  on FORMULA  are satisfied if
FORMULA 
For FORMULA  the canonical d–connection FORMULA  can be defined in torsionless formi.e. it has the same coefficients as the Levi Civita connection with respect
to N–elongated bases (REF ) and (REF ) with the coefficients
 FORMULA
FORMULA 
The curvature of a d–connection  FORMULA
FORMULA 
splits into six types of N–adapted components with respect to (REF )
and (REF ),

FORMULA 
Contracting respectively the components, FORMULA  one computes the h-
v–components of the Ricci d–tensor (there are four N–adapted components)
FORMULA 
The scalar curvature is defined by contracting the Ricci d–tensor with the
inverse metric  FORMULA
FORMULA 
If FORMULA  there are only three classes of d–curvatures,
FORMULA 
where all indices FORMULA  run the same values and, for instance, FORMULA   FORMULA

N–anholonomic Klein Spaces
There are Ricci flow families of two Hamiltonian variables given by the
principal normals FORMULA  and FORMULA  respectively, in the
horizontal and vertical subspaces, defined by the canonical d–connections FORMULA  see
formulas (REF ) and (REF ),
FORMULA 
This normal d–vectors FORMULA  FORMULA  with components of type
FORMULA 
are oriented in the tangent directions of curves FORMULA  There is also
the principal normal d–vectors FORMULA  with components of type FORMULA  FORMULA  in the flow directions, with
FORMULA 
representing a Hamiltonian d–covector field. We can consider that the
normal part of the flow d–vector
FORMULA 
represents a Hamiltonian d–vector field. For such configurations, we can
consider parallel N–adapted frames FORMULA  when the
h–variables FORMULA  FORMULA  are respectively
encoded in the top row of the horizontal canonical d–connection matrices FORMULA 
and FORMULA  and in the row matrix FORMULA  where FORMULA  is the tangential h–part of the flow d–vector. A similar
encoding holds for v–variables FORMULA  in the top
row of the vertical canonical d–connection matrices  FORMULA  and FORMULA  and in the
row matrix FORMULA  where FORMULA  is the
tangential v–part of the flow d–vector. In a compact form of notations, we
shall write FORMULA  and FORMULA  where the primed small Greek indices FORMULA  will denote both N–adapted and then
orthonormalized components of geometric objects (like d–vectors,
d–covectors, d–tensors, d–groups, d–algebras, d–matrices) admitting
further decompositions into h– and v–components defined as nonintegrable
distributions of such objects.
With respect to N–adapted orthonormalized frames, the geometry of
N–anholonomic manifolds is defined algebraically, on their tangent bundles,
by couples of horizontal and vertical Klein geometries considered in {{cite:7c9330fc-49e4-4847-afbd-6832d59dd2da}} and for bi–Hamiltonian soliton constructions in {{cite:1a7aaaf9-f592-4597-ad03-da2e5f53515d}}. The
N–connection structure induces a N–anholonomic Klein space stated by two
left–invariant FORMULA – and FORMULA –valued Maurer–Cartan
form on the Lie d–group FORMULA  is
identified with the zero–curvature canonical d–connection 1–form FORMULA  where
FORMULA 
For trivial N–connection structure in vector bundles with the base and
typical fiber spaces being symmetric Riemannian spaces, we can consider that
FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the coefficients
of the Cartan connections FORMULA  and FORMULA 
respectively for the FORMULA  and FORMULA  both with vanishing
curvatures, i.e. with
FORMULA 
and h– and v–components, FORMULA  and FORMULA  FORMULA 
where FORMULA  denotes the total derivatives on the d–group manifold FORMULA  or their restrictions on FORMULA  or FORMULA  We can consider that FORMULA  defines
the so–called Cartan d–connection for nonintegrable N–connection
structures, see details and supersymmetric/ noncommutative developments in {{cite:4d54e505-a4bc-427a-a87e-b6339c0a3b5a}}, {{cite:3438d6f9-d64e-4409-a2da-77b241d06b44}}.
Through the Lie d–algebra decompositions FORMULA  for the horizontal splitting: FORMULA  when FORMULA  and FORMULA  for the vertical splitting FORMULA  when FORMULA 
and FORMULA  the Cartan
d–connection determines an N–anholonomic Riemannian structure on the
nonholonomic bundle FORMULA  FORMULA  For FORMULA  and canonical d–objects
(N–connection, d–metric, d–connection, ...) derived from (REF ), or
any N–anholonomic space with constant d–curvatures, the Cartan

group FORMULA  FORMULA  regarding FORMULA  as a principal FORMULA –bundle over FORMULA  which is a N–anholonomic bundle. In this case, we
can always fix a local section of this bundle and pull–back FORMULA  to give a FORMULA –valued 1–form FORMULA  in a point FORMULA  Any change of local sections define FORMULA  FORMULA 
gauge transforms of the canonical d–connection FORMULA  all preserving the nonholonomic decomposition (REF ).
There are involutive automorphisms FORMULA  and FORMULA 
respectively, of FORMULA  and FORMULA  defined that FORMULA  (or FORMULA ) is eigenspace FORMULA  (or FORMULA  and FORMULA  (or FORMULA ) is eigenspace FORMULA  (or FORMULA  Taking into account the existing
eigenspaces, when the symmetric parts FORMULA  with respective h- and v–splitting, FORMULA  and FORMULA  defines
a FORMULA –valued
d–connection 1–form, we can construct N–adapted decompositions.
The antisymmetric part FORMULA  with h- and v–splitting, FORMULA  FORMULA  and FORMULA  defines a FORMULA –valued N–adapted coframe for the
Cartan–Killing inner product FORMULA  on FORMULA  restricted to FORMULA  This inner product,
distinguished into h- and v–components, provides a d–metric structure of
type FORMULA  (REF ), where FORMULA  and FORMULA

We generate a FORMULA –invariant
d–derivatives FORMULA  whose restriction to the tangent space FORMULA  for any N–anholonomic curve flow FORMULA  in FORMULA  FORMULA  is
defined via

admitting further h- and v–decompositions. The derivatives FORMULA  and FORMULA  in (REF ) are equivalent to those considered in (REF ) and obey the
Cartan structure equations (REF ) and (REF ). For the
canonical d–connections, a large class of N–anholonomic spaces of
dimension FORMULA  the d–torsions are zero and the d–curvatures are with
constant coefficients.
Let FORMULA  be a family of N–adapted orthonormalized
coframes identified with the FORMULA –valued coframe FORMULA  in a fixed orthonormal basis for FORMULA  Considering the kernel/ cokernel of Lie algebra
multiplications in the h- and v–subspaces, respectively, FORMULA  and FORMULA  we can decompose the coframes

defining a generalization of the concept of Riemannian parallel frame on
N–adapted manifolds whenever FORMULA  is larger than FORMULA  Substituting FORMULA  into the last
formulas and considering h- and v–components, we define FORMULA –parallel
and FORMULA –parallel frames (for simplicity we omit these formulas when the
Greek small letter indices are split into Latin small letter h- and
v–indices).
The final conclusion of this section is that the Cartan structure equations
on hypersurfaces swept out by nonholonomic curve flows on N–anholonomic
spaces with constant matrix curvature for the canonical d–connection
geometrically encode  two FORMULA – and FORMULA –invariant, respectively,
horizontal and vertical bi–Hamiltonian operators. This holds true if the
distinguished by N–connection freedom of the d–group action FORMULA  on FORMULA  and FORMULA  is used to
fix them to be a N–adapted parallel coframe and its associated canonical
d–connection 1–form is related to the canonical covariant derivative on
N–anholonomic manifolds.

Proof of the Main Theorem
We provide a proof of Theorem REF  for the horizontal
Ricci and curve flows (similar results were published in {{cite:036ee834-ceda-4d97-aed6-c66506202b38}} and {{cite:1a7aaaf9-f592-4597-ad03-da2e5f53515d}}, respectively, for Lagrange–Finsler and symmetric Riemannian
spaces). The vertical constructions are similar but with respective changing
of h– variables / objects into v- variables/ objects.
One obtains a vector mKdV equation up to a convective term, which can be
absorbed by redefinition of coordinates, defining the +1 flow for  FORMULA
FORMULA 
when the FORMULA  flow gives a vector mKdV equation of higher order FORMULA 
on FORMULA  and there is a 0 h–flow FORMULA  arising from FORMULA  and FORMULA  belonging
outside the hierarchy generated by FORMULA  Such flows
correspond to N–adapted horizontal motions of the curve FORMULA  given by
FORMULA 
subject to the non–stretching condition FORMULA  when the equation of motion is to be derived
from the identifications
FORMULA 
and so on, which maps the constructions from the tangent space of the curve
to the space FORMULA  For such identifications, we have
FORMULA 
and so on, see similar calculus in (REF ). At the next step, stating
for the +1 h–flow
FORMULA 
we compute
FORMULA 
Following above presented identifications related to the first and second
terms, when
FORMULA 
we can identify FORMULA  to FORMULA 
and write
FORMULA 
which is just the first equation (REF ) in the Theorem REF 
defining a family of non–stretching mKdV map h–equations induced by the
h–part of the family of canonical d–connections.
Using the adjoint representation FORMULA  acting in the Lie
algebra FORMULA  with
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
and the derived (applying FORMULA  again )
FORMULA 
the equation (REF ) can be represented in alternative form
FORMULA 
which is more convenient for analysis of higher order flows on FORMULA  subjected to higher–order geometric partial
differential equations. Here we note that the 0 flow one FORMULA  correspond to just convective (linear travelling h–wave but
subjected to certain nonholonomic constraints) map equations (REF ).
Now we consider -1 flows contained in the family of h–hierarchies derived
from the property that FORMULA  is
annihilated by the h–operator FORMULA  and mapped into FORMULA  This states
that FORMULA  Such properties together with (REF )
and equations (REF ) imply FORMULA  and
hence FORMULA  for FORMULA 
We obtain the equation of motion for the h–component of curve, FORMULA  following the correspondences FORMULA  and  FORMULA
FORMULA 
which is just the first equation in (REF ).
Finally, we note that the formulas for the v–components, stated by Theorem REF  can be derived in a similar form by respective substitution in the
the above proof of the h–operators and h–variables into v–ones, for
instance, FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA ,...where, for simplicity, we omit
parametric dependencies on  FORMULA
