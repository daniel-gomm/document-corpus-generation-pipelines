Abstract
A unified approach to (symmetric informationally complete) positive operator
valued measures and mutually unbiased bases is developed in this article.
The approach is based on the use of Racah unit tensors for the Wigner-Racah
algebra of FORMULA . Emphasis is put on
similarities and differences between SIC-POVMs and MUBs.
Keywords: finite–dimensional Hilbert spaces; mutually unbiased bases;
positive operator valued measures;
FORMULA  Wigner–Racah algebra
INTRODUCTION
The importance of finite–dimensional spaces for quantum mechanics is well
recognized (see for instance {{cite:537c0b18-5e78-4070-ac58-5608ee44c688}}-{{cite:db880d2d-3e74-49df-b80e-b910467e4595}}). In
particular, such spaces play a major role in quantum information theory,
especially for quantum cryptography and quantum state tomography
{{cite:c321c600-138f-4ce3-bbb0-1fdbeb8ece8f}}-{{cite:ca3ef2ae-f843-40ed-9069-b35301172b2b}}. Along this vein,
a symmetric informationally complete (SIC)
positive operator valued measure (POVM) is a set of operators acting on a
finite Hilbert space {{cite:c321c600-138f-4ce3-bbb0-1fdbeb8ece8f}}-{{cite:253f9a32-cc60-45b9-a514-e638fb1e11a2}} (see also
{{cite:db880d2d-3e74-49df-b80e-b910467e4595}} for an infinite Hilbert space) and mutually
unbiased bases (MUBs) are specific bases for such a space
{{cite:a4010bc0-210b-4f44-879d-c50ae2b0568c}}-{{cite:ca3ef2ae-f843-40ed-9069-b35301172b2b}}.
The introduction of POVMs goes back to the seventies
{{cite:c321c600-138f-4ce3-bbb0-1fdbeb8ece8f}}-{{cite:29cf5fa1-a115-4fa9-b345-b525da0c8a7e}}. The most general
quantum measurement is represented by a POVM.
In the present work, we will be interested in SIC-POVMs, for which the
statistics of the measurement allows the reconstruction of the quantum
state. Moreover, those POVMs are endowed with an extra symmetry condition
(see definition in Sec. 2). The notion of MUBs (see definition in Sec. 3),
implicit or explicit in the seminal
works of {{cite:a4010bc0-210b-4f44-879d-c50ae2b0568c}}-{{cite:6cf8ef7a-3d94-46dd-ab10-42b6146a49f6}}, has been the object of
numerous mathematical and physical
investigations during the last two decades in connection with the so-called
complementary observables. Unfortunately, the question to know, for a given
Hilbert space of finite dimension FORMULA , whether there exist SIC-POVMs and how
many MUBs there exist has remained an open one.
The aim of this note is to develop a unified approach to SIC-POVMs and MUBs
based on a complex vector space of higher dimension, viz. FORMULA  instead
of FORMULA . We then give a specific example of this approach grounded on the
Wigner-Racah algebra of the chain FORMULA 
recently used for a study of entanglement of rotationally invariant spin
systems {{cite:b2e5d5b3-5542-4f3b-a98a-1d06dd173dfe}} and for an angular momentum study of MUBs
{{cite:e8f13e2e-459c-4055-a422-62ec28ae719d}}, {{cite:ca3ef2ae-f843-40ed-9069-b35301172b2b}}.
Most of the notations in this work are standard. Let us simply mention that
FORMULA  is the identity operator, the bar indicates complex
conjugation, FORMULA  denotes the adjoint of the operator FORMULA ,
FORMULA  stands for the Kronecker symbol for FORMULA  and
FORMULA , and FORMULA  is 1 or 0 according as FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  satisfy
or not the triangular inequality.

SIC-POVMs
Let FORMULA  be the standard Hilbert space of dimension FORMULA  endowed with its usual inner product denoted by FORMULA . As
is usual, we will identify a POVM with a nonorthogonal decomposition of the
identity. Thus, a discrete SIC-POVM is a set
FORMULA  of FORMULA  nonnegative operators FORMULA 
acting on FORMULA , such that:

they satisfy the trace or symmetry condition
FORMULA 
moreover, we will assume the operators FORMULA  are
normalized, thus completing this condition with
FORMULA 

they form a decomposition of the identity
FORMULA 

they satisfy a completeness condition: the knowledge of the
probabilities
FORMULA  defined by FORMULA  is sufficient to
reconstruct the density matrix FORMULA .

Now, let us develop each of the operators FORMULA  on an orthonormal
(with respect to the Hilbert–Schmidt product) basis
FORMULA  of the space of linear operators on
 FORMULA
FORMULA 
where the operators FORMULA  satisfy
FORMULA . The
operators FORMULA  are thus considered as vectors
FORMULA 
in the Hilbert space FORMULA  of dimension FORMULA  and the
determination of the operators FORMULA  is equivalent to the determination of
the components FORMULA  of FORMULA . In this language, the trace property
(REF ) together with the normalization condition
(REF ) give
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the usual Hermitian product in FORMULA .
In order to compare Eq. (REF ) with what usually happens in the
search for SIC-POVMs, we suppose from now on that the operators FORMULA  are
rank-one operators. Therefore, by putting
FORMULA 
with FORMULA , the trace property
(REF , REF )
reads
FORMULA 
From this point of view, to find FORMULA  operators FORMULA  is equivalent to
finding FORMULA  vectors FORMULA  in FORMULA  satisfying
Eq. (REF ). At the price of an increase in the number
of components from FORMULA  (for FORMULA  vectors in FORMULA )
to FORMULA  (for FORMULA  vectors in FORMULA ), we
have got rid of the square
modulus to result in a single scalar product (compare Eqs. (REF )
and (REF )), what may prove to be suitable for
another way to search for SIC-POVMs. Moreover, our relation (REF )
is independent of any hypothesis on the rank of the operators FORMULA . In
fact, there exists a lot of relations among these FORMULA  coefficients that
decrease the effective number of coefficients to be found and give structural
constraints on them. Those relations are highly sensitive to the choice of
the basis FORMULA  and we are going to exhibit an
example of such a set of relations by choosing the basis to consist of Racah
unit tensors.
The cornerstone of this approach is to identify FORMULA  with a
subspace FORMULA  of constant angular momentum FORMULA . Such a
subspace is spanned by the set FORMULA , where
FORMULA  is an eigenvector of the square and the FORMULA -component of a
generalized angular momentum operator. Let FORMULA  be the Racah
unit tensor {{cite:5e688525-d607-47e7-aa85-ada8c933898a}} of order FORMULA  (with FORMULA ) defined by
its FORMULA  components FORMULA  (where FORMULA ) through
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  denotes a 3–FORMULA  Wigner symbol. For fixed FORMULA , the FORMULA  operators FORMULA  (with FORMULA  and
FORMULA ) act on FORMULA  and form
a basis of the Hilbert space FORMULA  of dimension FORMULA , the
inner product in FORMULA  being the Hilbert–Schmidt product. The
formulas (involving unit tensors, 3–FORMULA  and 6–FORMULA  symbols) relevant for
this work are given in Appendix (see also {{cite:5e688525-d607-47e7-aa85-ada8c933898a}} to
{{cite:c6f0eb04-355c-4ed9-9fb8-18288ecb7032}}). We must remember that those Racah operators are not
normalized to unity (see relation (REF )). So this will generate
an extra factor when defining FORMULA .
Each operator FORMULA  can be developed as a linear combination of the
operators FORMULA . Hence, we have
FORMULA 
where the unknown expansion coefficients FORMULA  are a priori
complex numbers. The determination of the operators FORMULA  is thus
equivalent to the determination of the coefficients FORMULA , which are
formally given by
FORMULA 
as can be seen by multiplying each member of Eq. (REF ) by the
adjoint of FORMULA  and then using Eq. (REF ) of Appendix.
By defining the vector
FORMULA 
via
FORMULA 
the following properties and relations are obtained.

The first component  FORMULA of  FORMULA does not depend on FORMULA  since
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA .
Proof: Take the trace of Eq. (REF ) and use Eq. (REF ) of
Appendix.

The components FORMULA  of FORMULA  satisfy the complex
conjugation property described by
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Proof: Use the Hermitian property of FORMULA  and Eq. (REF ) of
Appendix.

In terms of FORMULA , Eq. (REF ) reads
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA ,
where the sum over FORMULA  is FORMULA  rotationally invariant.
Proof: The proof is trivial.

The coefficients FORMULA  are solutions of the
nonlinear system given by
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA ,
FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA  and
FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA .
Proof: Consider FORMULA  and use the coupling relation (REF )
of Appendix involving a 3–FORMULA  and a 6–FORMULA  Wigner symbols.
As a corollary of the latter property, by taking FORMULA  and using Eqs. (REF )
and (REF ) of Appendix, we get again the normalization relation
FORMULA .

All coefficients FORMULA  are connected through the sum rule
FORMULA 
which turns out to be useful for global checking purposes.
Proof: Take the FORMULA –FORMULA  matrix element of the resolution of the
identity in terms of the operators FORMULA .


MUBs
A complete set of MUBs in the Hilbert space FORMULA  is a set of
FORMULA  vectors FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA . The indices of type
FORMULA  refer to the bases and, for fixed FORMULA , the index FORMULA  refers to one
of the FORMULA  vectors of the basis corresponding to FORMULA . We know that such a
complete set exists if FORMULA  is a prime or the power of a prime (e.g.,
see {{cite:06a4c119-e99f-4200-be86-fe28bffb7e60}}-{{cite:feab4135-018f-46bb-9b1a-69e1252514e0}}).
The approach developed in Sec. 2 for SIC-POVMs can be applied to MUBs too.
Let us suppose that it is possible to find FORMULA  sets FORMULA  (with
FORMULA ) of vectors in FORMULA , each set FORMULA  containing FORMULA  vectors FORMULA  such that Eq. (REF ) be satisfied. This amounts to finding
FORMULA  projection operators
FORMULA 
satisfying the trace condition
FORMULA 
where the trace is taken on FORMULA . Therefore, they also form a
nonorthogonal decomposition of the identity
FORMULA 
As in Sec. 2, we develop each operator FORMULA  on an orthonormal
basis with expansion coefficients FORMULA . Thus we get vectors FORMULA  in  FORMULA
FORMULA 
such that
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Now we draw the same relations as for POVMs by choosing the Racah operators
to be our basis in FORMULA . We assume once again that the
Hilbert space FORMULA  is realized by FORMULA  with FORMULA . Then, each operator FORMULA  can be developed on the
basis of the FORMULA  operators FORMULA  as
FORMULA 
to be compared with Eq. (REF ). The expansion coefficients are
FORMULA 
for all
FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA ,
FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA ,
FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA  and
FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA . For FORMULA  and FORMULA  fixed, the
complex coefficients FORMULA  define a vector
FORMULA 
in the Hilbert space FORMULA , the components of which are given by
FORMULA 
We are thus led to the following properties and relations. The proofs are
similar to those in Sec. 2.

First component  FORMULA of FORMULA :
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA  and FORMULA .

Complex conjugation property:
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA .

Rotational invariance:
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA  and
FORMULA .

Tensor product formula:
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA .

Sum rule:
FORMULA 
which involves all coefficients FORMULA .


CONCLUSIONS
Although the structure of the relations in Sec. 1 on the one hand and Sec. 2
on the other hand is very similar, there are deep differences between the
two sets of results. The similarities are reminiscent of the fact that both
MUBs and SIC-POVMs can be linked to finite affine planes
{{cite:22004b52-7e5a-46b3-9b36-9bf37cb517ee}}, {{cite:de139c52-e98d-41e8-b235-4044b4be2072}}, {{cite:9b18fb5d-7107-4421-bddb-98aa4e828a17}}, {{cite:5a5dc77e-b0c9-4e2c-bde8-d1f177c796d2}}, {{cite:dfc87244-4786-4893-b7e8-f742bcd4a780}}
and to complex projective 2–designs
{{cite:eda59f6b-182b-4f3f-aea3-b178f9c20f58}}, {{cite:9018efa7-3fd8-4cc8-b99d-9519b0ae2b4b}}, {{cite:63e07ac9-f0ab-4633-b07a-c4f00f16daa0}}, {{cite:feab4135-018f-46bb-9b1a-69e1252514e0}}. On the other side, there are two
arguments in favor of the differences between relations (REF ) and
(REF ). First, the problem of constructing SIC-POVMs in dimension
FORMULA  is not equivalent to the existence of an affine plane of order FORMULA 
{{cite:22004b52-7e5a-46b3-9b36-9bf37cb517ee}}, {{cite:de139c52-e98d-41e8-b235-4044b4be2072}}. Second, there is a consensus around the conjecture
according to which there exists a complete set of MUBs in dimension FORMULA  if
and only if there exists an affine plane of order FORMULA  {{cite:9b18fb5d-7107-4421-bddb-98aa4e828a17}}.
In dimension FORMULA , to find FORMULA  operators FORMULA  of a SIC-POVM acting on
the Hilbert space FORMULA  amounts to find FORMULA  vectors FORMULA  in
the Hilbert space FORMULA  with FORMULA  satisfying
FORMULA 
(the norm FORMULA  of each vector FORMULA  is 1 and the
angle FORMULA  of any pair of vectors FORMULA  and FORMULA  is
FORMULA  for FORMULA ).
In a similar way, to find FORMULA  MUBs of FORMULA  is equivalent to
find FORMULA  sets FORMULA  (with FORMULA ) of FORMULA  vectors,
i.e., FORMULA  vectors in all, FORMULA  in
FORMULA  with FORMULA  satisfying
FORMULA 
(each set FORMULA  consists of FORMULA  orthonormalized vectors and the angle
FORMULA  of any vector FORMULA  of a set FORMULA  with
any vector FORMULA  of a set FORMULA  is FORMULA  for FORMULA ).
According to a well accepted conjecture {{cite:eda59f6b-182b-4f3f-aea3-b178f9c20f58}}, {{cite:9018efa7-3fd8-4cc8-b99d-9519b0ae2b4b}}, SIC-POVMs
should exist in any dimension. The present study shows that in order to
prove this conjecture it is sufficient to prove that Eq. (REF )
admits solutions for any value of FORMULA .
The situation is different for MUBs. In dimension FORMULA , it is known that
there exist FORMULA  sets of FORMULA  vectors of type FORMULA  in FORMULA  satisfying Eq. (REF ) when FORMULA  is a prime or the
power of a prime. This shows that Eq. (REF ) can be solved
for FORMULA  prime or power of a prime. For FORMULA  prime, it is possible to find an
explicit solution of Eq. (REF ). In fact, we have
{{cite:e8f13e2e-459c-4055-a422-62ec28ae719d}}, {{cite:ca3ef2ae-f843-40ed-9069-b35301172b2b}}
FORMULA 
for FORMULA  while
FORMULA 
for FORMULA  and FORMULA . Then, Eq. (REF ) yields
FORMULA 
for FORMULA  while
FORMULA 
for FORMULA  and FORMULA . It can be shown that
Eqs. (REF ) and (REF ) are in agreement with the results
of Sec. 3. We thus have a solution of the equations for the results of
Sec. 3 when FORMULA  is prime. As an open problem, it would be worthwhile to find
an explicit solution for the coefficients FORMULA  when FORMULA 
is any positive power of a prime. Finally, note that to prove (or disprove)
the conjecture according to which a complete set of MUBs in dimension FORMULA 
exists only if FORMULA  is a prime or the power of a prime is equivalent to prove
(or disprove) that Eq. (REF ) has a solution only if FORMULA  is a
prime or the power of a prime.

APPENDIX: WIGNER-RACAH ALGEBRA OF  FORMULA
We limit ourselves to those basic formulas for the Wigner-Racah algebra of
the chain FORMULA  which are necessary to
derive the results of this paper. The summations in this appendix have to be
extended to the allowed values for the involved magnetic and angular
momentum quantum numbers.
The definition (REF ) of the components FORMULA  of the
Racah unit tensor FORMULA  yields
FORMULA 
from which we easily obtain the Hermitian conjugation property
FORMULA 
The 3–FORMULA  Wigner symbol in Eq. (REF ) satisfies the
orthogonality relations
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
The trace relation on the space  FORMULA
FORMULA 
easily follows by combining Eqs. (REF ) and (REF ). Furthermore, by introducing
FORMULA 
in Eq. (REF ), we obtain the sum rule
FORMULA 
known in spectroscopy as the barycenter theorem.
There are several relations involving 3–FORMULA  and 6–FORMULA  symbols.
In particular, we have
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  denotes a 6–FORMULA  Wigner symbol (or FORMULA  Racah coefficient). Note that the introduction of
FORMULA 
in Eq. (REF ) gives back Eq. (REF ). Equation (REF ) is central in the derivation of the coupling relation
FORMULA 
Equation (REF ) makes it possible to calculate the commutator FORMULA  which shows that the set
FORMULA 
can be used to
span the Lie algebra of the unitary group U(FORMULA ). The latter result is at
the root of the expansions (REF ) and (REF ).
Note added in version 3
After the submission of the present paper for publication in
Journal of Russian Laser Research,
a pre-print dealing with the existence of SIC-POVMs was posted
on arXiv {{cite:355721bf-990f-47b2-a5d3-1cc7b4862bff}}. The main result in {{cite:355721bf-990f-47b2-a5d3-1cc7b4862bff}} is that
SIC-POVMs exist in all dimensions. As a corollary of this
result, Eq. (34) admits solutions in any dimension.
