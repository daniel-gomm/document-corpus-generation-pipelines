We discuss several aspects of direct CP asymmetries in FORMULA  decays, which are very useful in spite
of hadronic uncertainties in asymmetry calculations. 1) Asymmetries in decays to
FORMULA , FORMULA , providing precision tests for the CKM phase FORMULA .
2) Null tests in FORMULA , where a nonzero asymmetry provides
evidence for New Physics. 3) Isospin and
broken flavor SU(3) relations among CP asymmetries in FORMULA  predicting
FORMULA  and FORMULA .
4) The significance of FORMULA .
5) A potentially stringent constraint on FORMULA  from FORMULA  and
FORMULA .
6) The role of direct CP asymmetries in FORMULA  decays for studying the origin of
potential New Physics.

Importance of direct CP violation
It took 35 years from the discovery of tiny CP violation in FORMULA -FORMULA 
mixing by Christenson, Cronin, Fitch and Turlay {{cite:58620ddd-ebc5-420f-9748-57ee7e6f1a52}}
to an observation of direct CP violation in
FORMULA  by the KTeV {{cite:765eea1c-e538-4590-9f57-7797f9106001}} and NA48 {{cite:7ec8d52c-00a4-43ec-9690-b515af737da1}}
collaborations. While this observation
was very important by itself, ruling out the Superweak hypothesis for CP
violation {{cite:6254f8d9-5955-4f5f-a081-d8baeb8c59d3}}, hadronic uncertainties involved in calculating this effect
prohibited a precise quantitative test of the CKM framework {{cite:82d6300e-636b-4ea1-a3b5-955c99d5c84a}}.
Tremendous effort has been devoted by the CLEO collaboration at Cornell, by BaBar at SLAC,
Belle at KEK, and by the CDF and D0 collabotaions at Fermilab, to measure direct CP violation in hundreds of charged and neutral FORMULA  decay modes. A small sample of the measured
asymmetries is plotted in Fig. 1 {{cite:a8d7e9ca-a148-4656-8cef-689175cfd3f8}}. The asymmetry in FORMULA , involving
the smallest experimental error, provides unambiguous evidence for direct CP violation.
FIGURE 
Difficulty of calculating asymmetries
Calculations of direct CP asymmetries
involve uncertainties from weak hadronic matrix elements and strong final state phases.
To illustrate these uncertainties, consider for instance the decay FORMULA  which
has a dominant penguin amplitude and a CKM-suppressed tree amplitude, as shown in Fig. 2.
FIGURE 
The amplitudes for this decay process and its charge-conjugate are given in terms of
suitably defined magnitudes FORMULA , a CP-conserving strong phase FORMULA , and a
CP-violating weak phase FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
A calculation of the CP asymmetry in terms of FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
requires computing FORMULA  and FORMULA . This is extremely difficult, as these quantities involve
non-perturbative long-distance effects. In QCD calculations based on a heavy quark
expansion {{cite:67623030-82c4-44e3-ac68-580a72ddd1c3}}, {{cite:365e6bdf-33f0-4376-9da0-7a7b9ce28db0}}, {{cite:7a6b414d-f5b1-46e0-a15d-e4b949c6b5c1}} one faces uncertainties in these quantities
from chirally enhanced FORMULA -suppressed terms including
annihilation contributions from penguin operators, FORMULA -suppressed terms
and “charming penguin" terms {{cite:8de4690b-cdc6-4a4c-890c-202390e1e9ac}}. Some of these contributions can be
traced back to incalculable soft rescattering amplitudes from FORMULA  intermediate states.
A clear distinction between calculable short distance contributions and incalculable soft contributions
is particularly challenging for the strong phase FORMULA .
While observing direct CP violation in FORMULA  decays is important by itself, it then seems that these asymmetries (like the one in FORMULA ) cannot
provide accurate tests for the mechanism of CP violation, originating in the Standard Model in the
phase FORMULA  of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix. The purpose
of this talk is to show that, in fact, direct asymmetries measured in certain FORMULA  decay modes
do provide precision tests for the CKM framework, in spite of theoretical difficulties in calculating
these asymmetries.

Determining FORMULA  in  FORMULA
We recall well-known examples of direct CP asymmetries in a whole class of processes
FORMULA , where FORMULA  and FORMULA  decay to a variety of common final states. These
decays provide a clean determination of the weak phase FORMULA  {{cite:2364dc09-682d-4625-b0a2-d485b9b8c092}}.
The trick here lies in recognizing the measurements which yield this fundamental CP-violating
quantity through interference of tree-level FORMULA  and FORMULA  amplitudes. A broad and up-to-date review of CP violation in the FORMULA  meson system,
including numerous references for studies of FORMULA , can be found in
Ref. {{cite:32f43a12-c4fd-415a-a2ca-d469a16759b4}}.

Determining FORMULA  in  FORMULA
In FORMULA  and FORMULA , mixing-induced asymmetries (FORMULA ) and
direct asymmetries (FORMULA ) are both needed to fix FORMULA  in a rather
precise method based on isospin symmetry {{cite:745ea194-8494-45e8-bb32-65a9b3ae1ce4}}.
Measurements of these asymmetries and conservative assumptions about flavor SU(3) breaking
yield the currently most precise value
FORMULA  {{cite:256f77af-015b-4c9d-98c9-402bb52363f1}}, {{cite:b8e4be91-1b1a-46d2-9ba1-45a3cca12110}}, {{cite:32f43a12-c4fd-415a-a2ca-d469a16759b4}}, in
agreement with FORMULA 
obtained from FORMULA  {{cite:44ff6b0e-ef30-475c-ac64-1dd5a596c0d7}}.

Null tests of the CKM framework
Interesting applications of direct CP asymmetries are null tests of the CKM framework
in decays where asymmetries are expected to be very small. Two processes
dominated by a single CKM phase are FORMULA  {{cite:38d34175-12a6-4a70-a09d-afaa3b147d30}}, {{cite:1849b17e-ce77-4a55-9200-6617863c3b6b}}
and FORMULA , where the Standard Model predicts vanishingly small
asymmetries, much smaller than one percent. This includes electroweak penguin
contributions in FORMULA  {{cite:0e423178-c125-4cfe-af74-38d1714ec03c}}. A nonzero asymmetry observed
in one of these modes at a percent level (as small as it can be with future anticipated
precision {{cite:a8d7e9ca-a148-4656-8cef-689175cfd3f8}}) would be a clean signature for New Physics.

Enhanced CP asymmetries
While in general calculating strong phases is very difficult
(though phases are known in e.g. FORMULA  mediated by FORMULA 
resonant states {{cite:6b585974-b816-444a-820d-878cbb3092b5}}),
asymmetry measurements provide information
for studying the dynamics of hadronic decays. Thus, certain charmless FORMULA  decays have been
predicted to lead to larger asymmetries than others, because they involve two interfering
amplitudes with different weak phases, whose ratio is expected to be dynamically enhanced.
This may follow from an enhancement of the smaller of the two amplitudes, or a suppression
of the larger amplitude. Such effects were noted in an approach using flavor
SU(3) symmetry  {{cite:480c4e5d-0c69-44ab-b8e4-a1036a0e893a}}, {{cite:e047ede4-d5d6-40be-9647-1cddbcd2e1b6}}, and may probably be realized in QCD
calculations {{cite:67623030-82c4-44e3-ac68-580a72ddd1c3}}, {{cite:365e6bdf-33f0-4376-9da0-7a7b9ce28db0}}.
We mention four examples for this enhancement effect using the language of flavor SU(3)
amplitudes: (1) FORMULA , where an amplitude FORMULA  smaller than FORMULA 
involves a factor 2, (2) FORMULA , where a potentially dominant FORMULA  amplitude involves
destructive interference between a few quark-level penguin amplitudes {{cite:ba014d86-da80-4050-afbc-37c25f3b2fa8}},
(3) FORMULA , where subdominant FORMULA  and FORMULA  amplitudes
add up constructively, (4) FORMULA , which involves constructive
interference of FORMULA  and FORMULA  terms.
TABLE 
Table 1 quotes measured CP asymmetries for these four final states {{cite:a8d7e9ca-a148-4656-8cef-689175cfd3f8}}. All four
asymmetries are nonzero at a level of about FORMULA  with central values between 13
and 31 percent. Somewhat higher precision is required in these asymmetry measurements
for claiming unambiguous evidence of direct CP violation in these modes.

CP asymmetries in  FORMULA
Isospin sum rules for FORMULA  and  FORMULA
The decays FORMULA , which occur in four distinct final states, can be expressed
in terms of three isospin amplitudes {{cite:ac040bb6-bded-4734-81ec-0dd380dbbeb5}}.
The initial states are FORMULA , the final states are FORMULA  and the effective
weak Hamiltonian consists of FORMULA . Denoting
FORMULA  and FORMULA  amplitudes by FORMULA  and FORMULA  or FORMULA ,
the physical amplitudes for the two pairs of FORMULA  and FORMULA  decays are related to
each other by isospin reflection, implying {{cite:5635572b-fe76-48fc-80f0-fce0d63199d9}}
FORMULA 
This leads to an isospin quadrangle relation,
FORMULA 
which has important physical implications in terms of two approximate sum rules for decay
rates FORMULA  {{cite:7e5d2a4c-3295-478d-9108-e808d8f8284d}} and CP rate differences FORMULA  {{cite:78846e2d-d45c-428b-864e-7bc595c4d2b3}}:
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
We now present the shortest proofs for these sum rules, using the dominance of a
FORMULA  penguin amplitude FORMULA  (part of the isospin amplitude FORMULA ) in all FORMULA 
decays. Evidence for penguin-dominance is provided by the four measured FORMULA  decay
rates which are equal within FORMULA  {{cite:a8d7e9ca-a148-4656-8cef-689175cfd3f8}},
FORMULA 
The non-penguin amplitudes are calculated to be much smaller than FORMULA ,
FORMULA non-FORMULA  {{cite:67623030-82c4-44e3-ac68-580a72ddd1c3}}, {{cite:365e6bdf-33f0-4376-9da0-7a7b9ce28db0}}, {{cite:7a6b414d-f5b1-46e0-a15d-e4b949c6b5c1}}, {{cite:8de4690b-cdc6-4a4c-890c-202390e1e9ac}}, {{cite:e047ede4-d5d6-40be-9647-1cddbcd2e1b6}}.
Terms in the two sum rules (REF ) which are quadratic in FORMULA  (or FORMULA ) cancel trivially,
while terms which are linear in FORMULA  cancel because of (REF ). Thus, the only
terms which may violate the two sum rules are quadratic in non-penguin amplitudes, and
can be shown to amount to a few percent of each side of the two sum rules (REF ).
Indeed, the sum rule for decay rates FORMULA  holds within experimental errors which are
currently about FORMULA  of each side {{cite:a8d7e9ca-a148-4656-8cef-689175cfd3f8}}, {{cite:9f34337f-e7df-44ae-8b01-faf7c8379a1f}}.
The sum rule for CP rate asymmetries FORMULA , expected to hold within a similar precision,
leads to a prediction for the asymmetry in  FORMULA in terms of the other
three asymmetries which have been measured with higher precision (see Table II),
FORMULA 
This prediction, which is expected to hold within a few percent,
can be improved by reducing errors in FORMULA .
While the value (REF ) is consistent with experiment, higher accuracy in
asymmetry measurements is required for testing this prediction following from
the rather precise FORMULA  relation (REF ).
TABLE 

FORMULA  a puzzle?
The measurement of a nonzero CP asymmetry in FORMULA  provides the first evidence
for an interference between a dominant penguin amplitude FORMULA  and a small tree amplitude
FORMULA  with a nonzero relative strong phase FORMULA  between the two amplitudes. [See Eqs. (1) and (2)].
Such an interference occurs also in FORMULA , in which a spectator FORMULA -quark in FORMULA  is replaced by a FORMULA -quark.
No asymmetry has been observed in FORMULA . An assumption that other contributions to
this asymmetry are negligible has raised some questions
about the validity of the CKM framework. In fact, a color-suppressed tree amplitude FORMULA ,
also occurring in FORMULA  {{cite:480c4e5d-0c69-44ab-b8e4-a1036a0e893a}} (see Fig. 3), resolves this “puzzle"
if this amplitude is comparable in magnitude to FORMULA .
FIGURE 
A too naive assumption, FORMULA , has been made
in Ref. {{cite:480c4e5d-0c69-44ab-b8e4-a1036a0e893a}} followed by numerous other works.
More recent studies, including a global SU(3) fit for
all charmless FORMULA  decays to two pseudoscalars,
have shown that FORMULA  {{cite:e047ede4-d5d6-40be-9647-1cddbcd2e1b6}}, {{cite:0ac7efb9-482a-4760-ae29-165fc23ba5ab}}, {{cite:7e46409e-30d0-4d30-9542-d376204da298}}.
For consistency between the two CP asymmetries in FORMULA  and
FORMULA , the strong phase difference between FORMULA  and FORMULA  must be
negative and cannot be very small {{cite:214cfa50-9244-4aaa-9cab-625abd9284a5}}. This, and the somewhat large
value of FORMULA , seem to stand in
contrast to QCD calculations using a factorization theorem {{cite:67623030-82c4-44e3-ac68-580a72ddd1c3}}, {{cite:7a6b414d-f5b1-46e0-a15d-e4b949c6b5c1}}.
While this may be considered a difficulty for QCD calculations, by no means should it
be considered evidence for New Physics as argued sometimes.

A sum rule for FORMULA  and  FORMULA
The asymmetry FORMULA  and the ratio of rates FORMULA  defined in (REF )
involve the decay amplitude for FORMULA ,
which seems to confront QCD calculation with a difficulty. The smallness of the measured
asymmetry and of the measured value of FORMULA  lead to an interesting constraint on
FORMULA  which we discuss now.
Including color-favored and color-suppressed electroweak penguin
contributions, FORMULA  and FORMULA , one has
FORMULA 
A small FORMULA -suppressed annihilation amplitude FORMULA  from a current-current
operator has been neglected
in the two processes {{cite:67623030-82c4-44e3-ac68-580a72ddd1c3}}, {{cite:7a6b414d-f5b1-46e0-a15d-e4b949c6b5c1}}, {{cite:480c4e5d-0c69-44ab-b8e4-a1036a0e893a}}, {{cite:bbeb48a8-5747-4048-851e-9e54a73c6b68}}.
One introduces two calculable parameters for ratios of amplitudes,
FORMULA  and FORMULA .
The parameter FORMULA  is given by {{cite:67fd20c6-f75a-4676-b512-1c58eeb2da9e}}
FORMULA 
where the error includes an uncertainty from SU(3) breaking.
The parameter FORMULA  is defined by {{cite:fe6db96e-679d-414c-809d-103716bdee0c}}
FORMULA 
Here the error is dominated by the current uncertainty in
FORMULA , including also a
smaller error from SU(3) breaking estimated using QCD factorization.
The asymmetry FORMULA  and the ratio of rates FORMULA  are given,
to first order in FORMULA , by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the strong phase difference between FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Eliminating FORMULA 
it is now straight forward to prove the following sum rule {{cite:214cfa50-9244-4aaa-9cab-625abd9284a5}}
FORMULA 
This sum rule implies that at least one of the two terms whose
squares occur on the left-hand-side must be sizable, of the order of
FORMULA . The first term, FORMULA , is
already smaller than FORMULA , using the current FORMULA  bounds on FORMULA  and
FORMULA . Thus, the second term must provide a
dominant contribution. For FORMULA , this implies FORMULA . This range is expanded by including
errors in FORMULA  and FORMULA .
For instance, bounds FORMULA  would imply an important upper limit,
FORMULA . Current values of FORMULA  and FORMULA  lead to
an upper limit FORMULA  at
FORMULA  confidence level {{cite:214cfa50-9244-4aaa-9cab-625abd9284a5}}. This bound is consistent with
the value of FORMULA  obtained from FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
as mentioned above, but is not yet competitive with its precision.

SU(3) relations  FORMULA
One may prove two useful relations between CP rate differences within the CKM
framework {{cite:8d92b88a-fca2-4e5e-b2ca-5fe955183f55}}, {{cite:602dd6f8-5e83-456e-ac82-7418bf2bf4cf}}:
FORMULA 
A slightly over-simplified proof of these relations goes as follows. [A precise
proof, including electroweak penguin terms and justifying an assumption about
negligible FORMULA  terms can be found in Ref. {{cite:32f43a12-c4fd-415a-a2ca-d469a16759b4}}).]
Writing
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  contain strong and weak phases,
one has in the flavor SU(3) limit
FORMULA 
where FORMULA . Similarly,
FORMULA 
The CP rate differences in the two pairs of processes are given by interference terms
between FORMULA  and FORMULA  and between FORMULA  and FORMULA , which are equal in magnitude and
have opposite signs in FORMULA  and FORMULA . This proves (REF ) and ().
TABLE 
Using branching ratios from {{cite:a8d7e9ca-a148-4656-8cef-689175cfd3f8}} and asymmetries in Tables II and III,
Eq. (REF ) reads
FORMULA 
Both the signs and the magnitudes agree well, providing evidence for the success of
flavor SU(3).
We note that using SU(3) breaking factors FORMULA  for both FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
as assumed in {{cite:8d92b88a-fca2-4e5e-b2ca-5fe955183f55}}, would imply a factor
FORMULA  on the right-hand-side of (REF ) leading to a worse agreement.
Some reduction of errors in FORMULA  and FORMULA  is required in
order to determine well the pattern of SU(3) breaking in FORMULA .
The relation () and the value of FORMULA  in (REF ) obtained
using isospin symmetry imply a prediction for  FORMULA,
FORMULA 
The error is dominated by errors in FORMULA  and FORMULA .
An SU(3) breaking factor FORMULA  in FORMULA  would lower this prediction by a factor FORMULA .
A large positive CP asymmetry in FORMULA  implies comparable sides in the
FORMULA  isospin amplitude triangle, but a squashed FORMULA  isospin triangle.
This has a simplifying effect on the isospin analysis in FORMULA , where a discrete ambiguity
disappears in the limit of a flat FORMULA  triangle {{cite:745ea194-8494-45e8-bb32-65a9b3ae1ce4}}.

CP violation in  FORMULA
A class of FORMULA  penguin-dominated FORMULA  decays to CP-eigenstates has
attracted recently considerable attention.
This includes
final states FORMULA  and FORMULA , where FORMULA , for which measured mixing-induced asymmetries FORMULA  (for CP eignstates
with eigenvalues FORMULA ) and direct asymmetries FORMULA  are quoted
in Table IV {{cite:a8d7e9ca-a148-4656-8cef-689175cfd3f8}}.
TABLE 
Whereas a value FORMULA  {{cite:a8d7e9ca-a148-4656-8cef-689175cfd3f8}} is expected
approximately {{cite:14c96d56-457a-405e-a150-d8d7d6d51149}}, {{cite:2e985a98-db1c-401d-9177-1328e91beaa9}}, the actual average of all
corresponding measured entries
in Table IV is FORMULA .
A question often raised is “is this FORMULA  discrepancy caused by
New Physics?". In a similar manner, one may calculate the average of all direct
CP asymmetries obtaining a value FORMULA , which is
small and consistent with zero.
Does this mean that there is very little place for New Physics?
These two questions,
considering averages over several processes,
should be considered with care because in the Standard Model
both FORMULA  and FORMULA  are process-dependent.
The smallness of the asymmetries FORMULA  relative to FORMULA  may be related to small
strong phases FORMULA , because FORMULA  and FORMULA  are proportional to FORMULA 
and FORMULA , respectively {{cite:38d34175-12a6-4a70-a09d-afaa3b147d30}}.
Calculations of these asymmetries involve
hadronic uncertainties at a level of several percent, of order
FORMULA  {{cite:1cee2baf-b5c9-46c3-a0e5-1dcd3daa8201}}, {{cite:f0c67e51-aa82-4667-9b11-ab9aa188e789}}, {{cite:7d26f537-e310-4e48-81bd-6fa7d04511a5}}, {{cite:17811eaa-6ce6-43f9-a7a5-e0effd223b23}}.
It has been pointed out some time ago {{cite:2cbed5ce-fd50-4442-8ee1-7dd582f4c83c}} that if New Physics contributions
are at this low level, it becomes difficult to separate them from hadronic uncertainties
within the CKM framework.
The importance of direct CP asymmetries measured in this class of processes may be
demonstrated through two features of FORMULA  and FORMULA , by which one can distinguish
New Physics effects from hadronic uncertainties in the Standard Model and learn about
the origin of New Physics effects:

Within the Standard Model FORMULA  and FORMULA  can be shown to lie on
a circle {{cite:38d34175-12a6-4a70-a09d-afaa3b147d30}},
FORMULA 
whose radius depends on a process-dependent ratio of tree and penguin amplitudes
FORMULA . The locus on the circle is fixed by a strong phase
FORMULA .
In most cases one expects FORMULA  implying
FORMULA  {{cite:1cee2baf-b5c9-46c3-a0e5-1dcd3daa8201}}, {{cite:f0c67e51-aa82-4667-9b11-ab9aa188e789}}, {{cite:7d26f537-e310-4e48-81bd-6fa7d04511a5}}, {{cite:17811eaa-6ce6-43f9-a7a5-e0effd223b23}}.

Once the measured values of FORMULA  and FORMULA  disagree
with calculations of FORMULA  and the strong phase FORMULA  beyond hadronic
uncertainties, we will have solid evidence for New Physics. At this point one would
seek signatures characterizing classes of models rather than studying effects of
specific models of which quite a few exist
{{cite:2e985a98-db1c-401d-9177-1328e91beaa9}}, {{cite:fca4fc57-b6aa-4c86-be72-ad532535a142}}, {{cite:b2ac8e45-112c-4316-a2af-7f416d404ae4}}, {{cite:bf90d814-0029-47f6-8511-4a80ede2ca95}}, {{cite:c979e133-3970-4afd-b067-e564d15580f9}}, {{cite:db90e0c7-e011-4d6b-b85d-c52fd5d63eab}}.
A useful way for classifying extensions of the Standard Model
is by the isospin behavior, FORMULA  or FORMULA , of the new effective operators.

Recently it has been shown {{cite:5635572b-fe76-48fc-80f0-fce0d63199d9}} that the isospin structure of potential New
Physics operators contributing to FORMULA  can be determined
by studying FORMULA  and FORMULA  in FORMULA  together with two other kinds
of asymmetries: direct asymmetries FORMULA  in isospin-reflected decays FORMULA ,
and isospin-dependent CP-conserving asymmetries defined by
FORMULA 
A study of the currently measured four kinds of asymmetries has shown that potential New Physics contributions to these processes must be small. Some reduction of errors in the measured asymmetries is required for identifying a signature for New Physics and for a useful implementation of this method.
We refer the reader to Ref. {{cite:5635572b-fe76-48fc-80f0-fce0d63199d9}} for details of this analysis.

Conclusion
The importance of direct CP violation is demonstrated by using direct asymmetries in
FORMULA  for a determination of the weak phase
FORMULA . Asymmetries in FORMULA  provide unambiguous
signatures for New Physics. In spite of the difficuly of calculating strong phases, measured
asymmetries provide useful information about the dynamics of hadronic decays.
The different asymmetries measured in FORMULA  and FORMULA 
cannot be easily explained within QCD calculations, but should not be considered evidence
for New Physics. An isospin sum rule among the four FORMULA  asymmetries
predicts FORMULA . Small FORMULA  and small FORMULA 
imply an interesting constraint on FORMULA .
The flavor SU(3) prediction FORMULA 
works well. The ratio of the two asymmetries fixes the pattern
of SU(3) breaking, which is useful for a precise determination of FORMULA . Flavor SU(3)
predicts a large positive direct asymmetry in FORMULA , which has an implication on the FORMULA  isospin analysis. Direct CP asymmetries in FORMULA  play a central role in
studying New Physics operators, in particular for learning their isospin structure.
