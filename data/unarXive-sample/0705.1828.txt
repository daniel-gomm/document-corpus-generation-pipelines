Introduction
In this paper, we are concerned with the following semilinear
parabolic problem
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is a bounded,
convex, smooth domain, FORMULA , FORMULA ,
and the potential FORMULA  satisfies FORMULA 
for some positive constant FORMULA  and all FORMULA . It is well-known
that for any FORMULA  problem (REF ) has a unique
local in time solution. Specially, if the FORMULA -norm of the
initial datum is small enough, then (REF ) has global,
classical solution, while the solution to (REF ) ceases to
exist after some time FORMULA  and FORMULA  provided that the initial datum FORMULA  is
large in some suitable sense. In the latter case we call the
solution FORMULA  to (REF ) blows up in finite time and FORMULA  the
blow-up time. As usual, the blow-up set of the solution FORMULA  is
defined by
FORMULA 
Much effort has been devoted to blow-up problems for semilinear
parabolic equations since the pioneering works in 1960s due in
particular to interest in understanding the mechanism of thermal
runaway in combustion theory and as a model for reaction-diffusion.
See for example, {{cite:5d168438-822e-47eb-b1f5-8b85f9aaf770}}, {{cite:41a0ca16-0e8c-47ff-9589-1f53e8ce5f10}}, {{cite:c4a802b3-35ed-48e0-b54a-5f397bfb22dc}}, {{cite:2733ca9e-f3dc-4393-add6-9a4b464ba43b}}, {{cite:731262c9-e0f7-41b4-b06b-bd94cc3aafa0}}, {{cite:e05d2a89-0dad-4dcd-bf78-b858553f5f05}}, {{cite:003d97ad-39e3-4cd1-9a2c-043f302dfd0b}}, {{cite:cc3d197b-7392-44ef-a1c8-6d707d033744}}. The seminal works to
problem (REF ) with FORMULA  were done by Giga-Kohn
{{cite:fdff9bfa-116b-4c58-9701-bbbe387d7d67}}, {{cite:5f979802-356f-4f13-8102-6362e5dbb686}}, {{cite:a8fd8a5a-e2cf-4423-93fa-d4aeb55f9ede}}. In their paper {{cite:5f979802-356f-4f13-8102-6362e5dbb686}}, among other things,
they have obtained a blow-up rate estimate, which is crucial to
obtain the asymptotic behavior of the blow-up solution near the
blow-up time. More precisely, under the assumptions that the domain
FORMULA  is the entire space or convex and the solution is nonnegative
or FORMULA  or FORMULA , they
proved that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is a constant and FORMULA  is the blow-up time. More
recently, the same estimate has been obtained by
Giga-Matsui-Sasayama {{cite:09bdae62-e824-4667-8960-752814b212cf}}, {{cite:66e27e69-3d88-4452-b3ce-74152f417cfa}} for any subcritical FORMULA 
(i.e., FORMULA  when FORMULA , FORMULA  when
FORMULA ).
Whether the similar blow-up rate estimate holds for the problem
(REF ) for general potential FORMULA , to our best knowledge, is not
well-understood up to now. Our first goal in this paper is to give
an affirmative answer to this question. We have the following
Theorem 1.1 
Let FORMULA  be a blow-up solution to (REF ) with a blow-up time
FORMULA . There exists a positive constant FORMULA  depending only on
FORMULA , a bound for FORMULA  and the
positive lower bound FORMULA  for FORMULA  and FORMULA , such
that
FORMULA 

As in {{cite:5f979802-356f-4f13-8102-6362e5dbb686}}, we convert our problem to a uniform bound for a
global in time solution FORMULA  of the rescaled equation
FORMULA 
with
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the center of the rescaling.
The proof of Theorem REF  depends heavily on the methods
developed by Giga-Kohn in {{cite:5f979802-356f-4f13-8102-6362e5dbb686}} and Giga-Matsui-Sasayama in
{{cite:09bdae62-e824-4667-8960-752814b212cf}}, {{cite:66e27e69-3d88-4452-b3ce-74152f417cfa}}. However our result is definitely not a direct
consequence of their works. Due to the appearance of the potential
FORMULA , some extra works should be done. It turns out that the key
point and the main difference is to establish an upper bound for the
global energy of FORMULA  given by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA . A lower bound for the energy
can be obtained without much effort. When FORMULA , these bounds
come easily from the Liapunov structure of the equation, i.e., the
energy FORMULA  is non-increasing in time. In our case this does not
hold anymore. There is a “bad" term
FORMULA 
involved in the derivative of the energy FORMULA . The main idea of
proving Theorem REF  is as follows: First, using the fact that
FORMULA  is uniformly bounded in FORMULA 
for all FORMULA , we get a rough control of the growth of the global
energy FORMULA . Since the term FORMULA 
can be written as FORMULA , we can use the
information of the decay term FORMULA . However, it has
disadvantage that the unbounded thing FORMULA  involves. Therefore we
need some information from higher level energies
FORMULA 
So our second step is to establish the control of the higher level
energies. An upper bound for FORMULA  is obtained by an integral
involving lower level energy. A lower bound for FORMULA  is
obtained by two inequalities involving FORMULA  and FORMULA . Finally we obtain an
upper bound for the energy FORMULA . To this end, the growth of lower
level energies is improved by applying the growth of the higher
level energies. An upper bound of the global energy FORMULA  is
obtained by a similar trick to bootstrap argument. Once these bounds
are in hands, similar arguments to {{cite:09bdae62-e824-4667-8960-752814b212cf}}, {{cite:66e27e69-3d88-4452-b3ce-74152f417cfa}} can be applied
to show the boundedness of the global in time solution FORMULA , which in
turn implies the blow-up rate estimate (REF ).
Another aim of this paper is to establish the asymptotic behavior of
blow-up time and blow-up set of the blow-up solution to the problem
(REF ) with nonnegative initial data FORMULA  as FORMULA .
In this case, the problem we focused on can be rewritten as
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  satisfies FORMULA  and FORMULA  satisfies the same
conditions as before. For these issues of blow-up problems to
(REF ), we improve the results which have been obtained by
Cortazar-Elgueta-Rossi {{cite:61ac0d6a-a26c-4849-9345-31a4c1a65000}} recently.
In {{cite:61ac0d6a-a26c-4849-9345-31a4c1a65000}}, they have made some more technical condition on
FORMULA :
FORMULA 
The assumptions on FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the same as ours (although
their assumption that FORMULA  is Lipschitz is replaced by FORMULA  in our case, our results still hold when FORMULA  is Lipschitz).
Under these assumptions, they proved that there exists FORMULA 
such that if FORMULA , then blow-up occurs and the blow-up time
FORMULA  and the blow-up set FORMULA  of the blow-up solution to
(REF ) satisfy
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are two
positive constants.
For the upper bound estimate on blow-up time, we have the following
Theorem 1.2 
Let FORMULA  be a smooth bounded
domain, FORMULA , FORMULA  be continuous functions on FORMULA  with
FORMULA  for some FORMULA . Then for any FORMULA  there exists a constant
FORMULA  and FORMULA  such that for every FORMULA , the solution
to (REF ) blows up in finite time that verifies
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .

Remark 1.1 Our assumptions are weaker than ones in {{cite:61ac0d6a-a26c-4849-9345-31a4c1a65000}}. In {{cite:61ac0d6a-a26c-4849-9345-31a4c1a65000}},
they required FORMULA  and FORMULA  are Lipschitz continuous. Furthermore,
our result tells that the decay of the upper bound of
FORMULA  can be faster than which has been
obtained in {{cite:61ac0d6a-a26c-4849-9345-31a4c1a65000}}.

Notice that the proof of the upper bound of blow-up time in
{{cite:61ac0d6a-a26c-4849-9345-31a4c1a65000}} depends on an argument of so-called “projection method"
(see e.g. {{cite:003d97ad-39e3-4cd1-9a2c-043f302dfd0b}}) and the essential assumption that FORMULA  are
Lipschitz continuous. Our proof of Theorem REF  requires a
FORMULA -method (see e.g. {{cite:5d168438-822e-47eb-b1f5-8b85f9aaf770}}). The advantage of this method
compared with one in {{cite:61ac0d6a-a26c-4849-9345-31a4c1a65000}} is that we do not need to control
the first eigenvalue of Laplacian with Dirichlet boundary condition.
For the lower bound estimate for the blow-up time and the asymptotic
behavior of blow-up set, we have
Theorem 1.3 
Let FORMULA  be a convex, bounded,
smooth domain, FORMULA , FORMULA  be a continuous function
on FORMULA  with FORMULA , and FORMULA  with FORMULA  for some FORMULA . Then there exist two positive constants FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .

Applying Theorem REF  and the method in {{cite:61ac0d6a-a26c-4849-9345-31a4c1a65000}}, we get
Theorem REF  immediately. The only difference is that the role
of Lemma 2.1 in {{cite:61ac0d6a-a26c-4849-9345-31a4c1a65000}} is replaced by that of our Theorem
REF  now.
Remark 1.2 In our case, we do not need the assumption (REF ) anymore.

Remark 1.3 As described in {{cite:61ac0d6a-a26c-4849-9345-31a4c1a65000}}, the asymptotics depend on a combination
of the shape of both FORMULA  and FORMULA . To see this, if we drop the
Laplacian, we get the ODE FORMULA  with initial condition
FORMULA . This gives FORMULA  with
FORMULA 
It turns out that blow-up occurs at point FORMULA  such that
FORMULA . So
the quantity FORMULA  plays a
crucial role in the problem.

Remark 1.4 Also as in {{cite:61ac0d6a-a26c-4849-9345-31a4c1a65000}}, (REF ) shows that the blow-up set
concentrates when FORMULA  near the set where FORMULA  attains
its maximum. Notice that FORMULA  for any
maximizer FORMULA . If FORMULA  is a non-degenerate maximizer, we
conclude that there exist constants FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
So (REF ) implies
FORMULA 

Throughout the paper we will denote by FORMULA  a constant that does not
depends on the solution itself. And it may change from line to line.
And FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA ,
FORMULA , FORMULA  are positive constants depending
on FORMULA , a lower bound of FORMULA , FORMULA  and
the initial energy
FORMULA . Here and hereafter FORMULA .

Blow-Up Rate Estimates
In this section, we will prove Theorem REF .
We introduce the rescaled function
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  We shall denote FORMULA  by
FORMULA . If FORMULA  solves (REF ), then FORMULA  satisfies
FORMULA 
where  FORMULA
We may assume FORMULA  as in {{cite:09bdae62-e824-4667-8960-752814b212cf}} so that we assume FORMULA 
Here and hereafter we may denote FORMULA  by  FORMULA
By introducing a weight function
FORMULA , we can rewrite
(REF ) as the divergence form:
FORMULA 
As stated in {{cite:09bdae62-e824-4667-8960-752814b212cf}}, we may assume
FORMULA 
Global energy estimates
We introduce the energy of FORMULA  of the form (we call it the “global
energy")
FORMULA 
We shall show that this global energy satisfies the following
estimates.
Proposition 2.1 
Let FORMULA  be a global solution of (REF ), then
FORMULA 

Proposition 2.2 
Let FORMULA  be a global solution of (REF ), then
FORMULA 

We will prove these two properties in the following subsections.
Lower bound for  FORMULA
Lemma 2.3 
 FORMULA

We see from (REF ) that
FORMULA 
Calculating the derivative of FORMULA  and noting that FORMULA  we have
FORMULA 
or
FORMULA 
Notice that FORMULA  is bounded. By (REF ), using Young's
inequality, we have
FORMULA 
Taking FORMULA  small enough we get
FORMULA 
Since FORMULA 
is bounded and FORMULA  is convex, it follows from (REF ) and
(REF ) that
FORMULA 
Take FORMULA  small then we have
FORMULA 
From this inequality, we claim that FORMULA  If not, then there exists FORMULA  such that
FORMULA . By (REF ), we have
FORMULA  This implies that
FORMULA 
Hence by (REF ) and Jensen's inequality, for FORMULA 
we have
FORMULA 
This fact shows that FORMULA  will blow up in
finite time, which is impossible.

Upper bound for  FORMULA
To find an upper bound for FORMULA , we introduce
FORMULA 
For this energy functional, we shall prove the following properties.
Proposition 2.4
FORMULA 

Proposition 2.5
FORMULA 

Proof of Proposition REF . Similar to that of
{{cite:5f979802-356f-4f13-8102-6362e5dbb686}} Proposition 4.1.
Proof of Proposition REF .
FORMULA 
Estimating the first term of the right hand side, we get
FORMULA 
Hence we have
FORMULA 
For FORMULA , similar to Proposition 4.2 of {{cite:5f979802-356f-4f13-8102-6362e5dbb686}} we now state an
parabolic type Pohozaev identity.
Proposition 2.6
FORMULA 

We now define
FORMULA 
Lemma 2.7
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  depends on FORMULA  FORMULA  and FORMULA 
are constants such that FORMULA  and
FORMULA  and FORMULA  is a small constant.

Proof. By (REF ) and (REF ) we obtain that
FORMULA 
Since FORMULA  is convex, the third term on the right is always negative.
We control the second term by applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:
for any FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
Choosing FORMULA  small enough that
FORMULA 
we conclude that
FORMULA 
Now choose FORMULA , and apply (REF ) to get
FORMULA 
Let FORMULA , we derive that
FORMULA 
Note that FORMULA 
From (REF ) we get
FORMULA 
In the following we will denote FORMULA  by FORMULA .
Making use of the inequality
FORMULA 
we obtain that
FORMULA 
Here and hereafter FORMULA  denotes a constant depending on
FORMULA  and may be different at each occurrence. Take FORMULA 
and we hence have
FORMULA 
From (REF ) we obtain that
FORMULA 
Thanks to (REF ), we hence get
FORMULA 
Therefore we have
FORMULA 
Combining (REF ) with (REF ) and (REF ) we obtain that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is a constant such that
FORMULA .
Take FORMULA  small enough such that
FORMULA , then
FORMULA 
Denote
FORMULA , then we get
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  depends on FORMULA .
Lemma 2.8 
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  depends on FORMULA .

Proof.
From (REF ), using Jensen's inequality, we have
FORMULA 
This inequality plus FORMULA  (REF ) leads to
FORMULA 
Denote
FORMULA . Then
FORMULA 
We claim that
FORMULA 
If not, there exists FORMULA  such that FORMULA , then
(REF ) tells us that
FORMULA 
which shows that
FORMULA 
Therefore from (REF ) we get
FORMULA 
From this inequality, we easily conclude that FORMULA  will blow up in
finite time, which is impossible.
Hence our lemma holds.
To obtain rough estimates for the higher level energies, the
following two inequalities, i.e. (REF ) and (REF ), play an
important role. By Proposition REF  and Young's inequality, we
have
FORMULA 
Similar to (REF ), we have
FORMULA 
Taking FORMULA  small enough, we obtain that
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA .
On the other hand, by Proposition REF , Hölder inequality,
Young's inequality and Jensen's inequality we have
FORMULA 
Now we get following rough estimates
Lemma 2.9 
For any FORMULA , there exist positive constants FORMULA  and FORMULA , such that the following estimates hold:
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA  and FORMULA .

Proof.  Let FORMULA  be a strictly increasing sequence. It suffices to show
the following estimates:
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
We prove these estimates by induction.
Step 1. These estimates holds for FORMULA .
Note that (REF ) gives us
FORMULA 
which imply that FORMULA . Therefore we now
have FORMULA  by Lemma
REF .
Using the similar trick of getting (REF ), we can write
(REF ) as a more refinement form:
FORMULA 
then FORMULA  and therefore FORMULA  It follows
that
FORMULA 
From (REF ), we have
FORMULA 
Multiplying FORMULA  on both sides and integrating from 0
to FORMULA , we obtain that
FORMULA 
In particular, (REF ) holds for FORMULA .
Denote FORMULA . Notice that
FORMULA 
If there exists FORMULA  such that FORMULA , then at FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
since FORMULA  can be large enough. It follows that FORMULA  for all FORMULA . So FORMULA 
and then FORMULA  for all FORMULA , which implies that FORMULA  will
blow up in finite time. This contradicts the fact that FORMULA  is
globally defined. So we have
FORMULA 
In other words, (REF ) holds for FORMULA .
By (REF ),
FORMULA 
It follows from (REF ) that
FORMULA 
On the other hand, by (REF ) and the definition of FORMULA , we
have
FORMULA 
where the last inequality follows from (REF ) for FORMULA .
Therefore (REF ) also holds for FORMULA .
Step 2. (REF )-(REF ) holds for all FORMULA .
Suppose (REF )-(REF ) holds for FORMULA . Since
(REF ) holds for FORMULA , by (REF ) and a similar argument to
derive (REF ) we conclude that (REF ) holds for FORMULA . By
(REF ), we have
FORMULA 
Since (REF ) holds for FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
Now we need to obtain the lower bound for FORMULA . Denote
FORMULA 
Then it follows from (REF ) and (REF ) that
FORMULA 
The last inequality implies that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA . By induction
hypothesis, we have
FORMULA 
We claim that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .
Otherwise, there exists FORMULA  such that FORMULA . By (REF ), we have
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA . So FORMULA , i.e., FORMULA  for all FORMULA . Now from (REF )
we conclude that FORMULA  for all
FORMULA , which implies FORMULA  blows up in finite time. This
is a contradiction. Therefore FORMULA 
and then FORMULA . In particular,
(REF ) holds for FORMULA .
Finally, by (REF ), we have
FORMULA 
Combining this with the fact that FORMULA  and (REF ) we have
FORMULA 
By (REF ), we obtain
FORMULA 
Therefore, by FORMULA , we get
FORMULA 
Hence (REF ) holds for FORMULA . The Lemma is proved.
Remark 2.1 
We have seen in the proof of this Lemma that
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 

Next, we need the following
Lemma 2.10 
Suppose FORMULA  and for some FORMULA , there exist positive constants FORMULA  and FORMULA , such that
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
hold for all FORMULA  and FORMULA . Then
there exist positive constants FORMULA  and FORMULA , such that
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
hold for all FORMULA  and FORMULA . Here we
set FORMULA .

Proof.  Let FORMULA  be a strictly decreasing sequence. It suffices to show
the following estimates:
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
We prove these estimates by induction.
Step 1. These estimates hold for FORMULA .
Recalling (REF ) we have
FORMULA 
Also we get
FORMULA 
By (REF ) and the assumptions of this Lemma, then we get
FORMULA 
So
FORMULA 
We claim that
FORMULA 
Indeed, if we denote the left hand side of (REF ) by FORMULA ,
then FORMULA  by
the assumption. It follows that
FORMULA 
by integration by parts. So (REF ) holds and
FORMULA 
Notice that we have proved that FORMULA . Therefore
(REF ) holds for FORMULA .
By (REF ), (REF ) and FORMULA , we deduce that
FORMULA 
As usual, we have
FORMULA 
Then
FORMULA 
Let FORMULA . Then for any FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
due to (REF ). So
FORMULA 
i.e., (REF ) holds for FORMULA .
Step 2. (REF ) and (REF ) hold for all FORMULA .
Suppose (REF ) and (REF ) hold for all FORMULA . Taking FORMULA  in (REF ), we get
FORMULA 
Notice that we have used that FORMULA  and the assumptions of the
Lemma. Hence we get
FORMULA 
Since FORMULA , we get
FORMULA 
as before. Let FORMULA . Then by induction
hypothesis, we have
FORMULA 
So
FORMULA 
i.e., FORMULA .
Therefore
FORMULA 
Now let FORMULA . Then
by (REF ) and (REF ), we have
FORMULA 
Since FORMULA ,
where FORMULA  and FORMULA . It follows from (REF ) and induction hypothesis
that
FORMULA 
A similar argument to obtain (REF ) gives us
FORMULA 
From (REF ) and (REF ), we know that (REF ) holds for
FORMULA .
From the fact that
FORMULA 
and above estimates, we have
FORMULA 
As before, we have
FORMULA 
Multiplying FORMULA  on both sides and integrating
over FORMULA , we obtain
FORMULA 
i.e., (REF ) holds for FORMULA . So the proof of this Lemma is
complete.
To obtain the upper bound of FORMULA , we also need the following
Lemma 2.11 
Suppose that there exist two positive constants FORMULA  and some
FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
Then we have
FORMULA 

Proof.  Recall from (REF ) that
FORMULA 
By the lower bound of FORMULA  and Young's inequality, we get
FORMULA 
Using (REF ), we have
FORMULA 
By Lemma REF , we may assume FORMULA . So
FORMULA 
Noticing that FORMULA , we obtain that FORMULA  from the assumptions.
Proof of Proposition  REF Combining Lemma REF 
with Lemma REF , Lemma REF  and Remark REF , we get
the upper bound of FORMULA  immediately. Notice that the lower bound
of FORMULA  has been obtained in Lemma REF . So the proof is
complete.

Proof of Proposition  REF
Proof of (REF ). From (REF ) we have
FORMULA 
Then (REF ) tells us that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA , which
is an integrable function. Integrating this inequality from FORMULA  to
FORMULA , we get
FORMULA 
It follows that
FORMULA 
Proof of (). Making use of Jensen's inequality,
from (REF ), we get
FORMULA 
We assert that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is
the zero of FORMULA .
If not, there exists FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
Then
FORMULA 
which implies that
FORMULA 
Then there exists some FORMULA  such that for FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
so that FORMULA  blows up in finite time,
which is impossible.
Proof of (). Recall that FORMULA  and
FORMULA . Then from (REF ) we see that
FORMULA 
Therefore by (REF ) and () we have
FORMULA 

Proof of Theorem  REF
Let FORMULA  be a bounded function with
FORMULA  Then FORMULA 
satisfies
FORMULA 
We introduce two types of local energy.
FORMULA 
By the similar trick of {{cite:09bdae62-e824-4667-8960-752814b212cf}}, we could establish a lower and
an upper bound for FORMULA . We just list some
important results and ignore the proof.
Upper bound for  FORMULA
Using (REF ) and () we obtain that
FORMULA 
where  FORMULA
Proposition 2.12 (Quasi-monotonicity of FORMULA )
FORMULA 

for all  FORMULA
Proposition 2.13 There exists a positive constant FORMULA , such that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  depends on FORMULA , upper bound for
FORMULA  and upper bound for FORMULA .

Note that
FORMULA 
Thanks to (REF ), (REF ) and (REF ) we can derive an
upper bound for  FORMULA
Theorem 2.14
FORMULA 


Lower bound for  FORMULA
Notice that
FORMULA 
By estimating FORMULA  and using () we
obtain
Proposition 2.15 There exists a positive constant FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 

By (REF ), (REF ) and (REF ) we obtain that
Theorem 2.16 There exists a positive constant FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 

Once we have these bounds for the local energies, the proof of
Theorem REF  follows from bootstrap arguments, an
interpolation theorem in {{cite:170b7551-368f-4031-9d56-53c7ae7052d9}} and the interior regular theorem
in {{cite:c6e62793-8207-4764-8f1d-e9ce859ad1a5}} as in {{cite:09bdae62-e824-4667-8960-752814b212cf}}, {{cite:66e27e69-3d88-4452-b3ce-74152f417cfa}}. We omit the details since
there is no anything new.
Remark 2.2 If we only treat nonnegative solution to (REF ), then Theorem
REF  can be proved through the bounds we have obtained in
Section 2.1. We can combine the methods in {{cite:5f979802-356f-4f13-8102-6362e5dbb686}} and {{cite:9c58616e-ccc8-4b13-b407-01fbfd3287a2}}
to get the blow-up rate estimate.


Asymptotic behavior of the Blow-Up Time and Blow-Up set
In this section, we are interested in the following problem
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  satisfies FORMULA  and FORMULA  satisfies the conditions
described as in Section 1.
The main goal of this section is to prove Theorem REF  and
REF .
Proof of Theorem REF .  That blow-up occurs for
large FORMULA  is standard fact. Let FORMULA  such that
 FORMULA
Since FORMULA  and FORMULA  are continuous, it follows that FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
Let FORMULA  be the solution of
FORMULA 
and FORMULA  its corresponding blow up time.
A comparison argument shows that FORMULA  in FORMULA  and hence  FORMULA
Our goal is to estimate FORMULA  for large values of FORMULA . Define
FORMULA 
then
FORMULA 
Set FORMULA  then we
obtain that
FORMULA 
where  FORMULA
In particular,  FORMULA
On the other hand,
FORMULA 
which tells us that FORMULA 
Therefore from (REF ) we get
FORMULA 
Set
FORMULA 
and
 FORMULA
Note that
FORMULA 
It follows that FORMULA  Hence
FORMULA 
Then FORMULA  such that  FORMULA
Define FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the blow-up time of FORMULA  Then FORMULA  is closed. On
the other hand, FORMULA  is open. In fact, FORMULA 
since
FORMULA 
it follows that FORMULA  for  FORMULA
Recall that FORMULA  We conclude that
FORMULA 
In particular,  FORMULA
Thus, there exists FORMULA  such that for all FORMULA  or
FORMULA 
which means FORMULA  Therefore FORMULA  In other words,
FORMULA 
Integrating this inequality from 0 to FORMULA , we get
FORMULA 
Since FORMULA  is arbitrarily small, the Theorem follows readily
from the above estimate.
Proof of Theorem REF .  The proof is almost the same
as in {{cite:61ac0d6a-a26c-4849-9345-31a4c1a65000}}. The only different thing is that we improve their
Lemma 2.2. For the reader's convenience, we outline the proof here.
Let FORMULA  be large such that the solution FORMULA  blows up in finite time
FORMULA  and let FORMULA  be a blow-up point. To involve the
information of FORMULA , we modify the definition of FORMULA  to be
FORMULA 
Then FORMULA  satisfies
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .
Consider the frozen energy
FORMULA 
Then
FORMULA 
We have used Theorem REF  and Hölder inequality in the
last inequality. So FORMULA  and then
FORMULA 
Since FORMULA  is bounded, by the argument of {{cite:5f979802-356f-4f13-8102-6362e5dbb686}} and {{cite:a8fd8a5a-e2cf-4423-93fa-d4aeb55f9ede}},
we conclude that
FORMULA 
uniformly in any compact set, and
FORMULA 
So
FORMULA 
By Theorem REF , we estimate FORMULA  to get FORMULA . So
FORMULA 
Observe that FORMULA  for any constant FORMULA , where FORMULA  and
FORMULA . It follows that
FORMULA  attains a unique maximum at FORMULA  and there exist FORMULA  such that if FORMULA  then FORMULA  and if
FORMULA  then FORMULA . From (REF ), we
have FORMULA . By the properties of FORMULA  we have
FORMULA 
By Theorem REF , for any FORMULA  there exists FORMULA  such that
if FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
Therefore, we get
FORMULA 
if we choose FORMULA . Then
FORMULA 
This implies
FORMULA 
We can deduce from this inequality that FORMULA  for
large FORMULA . So
FORMULA 
Therefore
FORMULA 
i.e.,
FORMULA 
The Theorem is proved.
