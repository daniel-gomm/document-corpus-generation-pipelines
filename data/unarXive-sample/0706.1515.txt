The generalized FORMULA -D non-linear Schrödinger (NLS) theory
with particular integrable boundary conditions is considered. More
precisely, two distinct types of boundary conditions, known as
soliton preserving (SP) and soliton non-preserving (SNP), are
implemented into the classical FORMULA  NLS model. Based on this
choice of boundaries the relevant conserved quantities are
computed and the corresponding equations of motion are derived. A
suitable quantum lattice version of the boundary generalized NLS
model is also investigated. The first non-trivial local integral
of motion is explicitly computed, and the spectrum and Bethe
Ansatz equations are derived for the soliton non-preserving
boundary conditions.

Introduction
After various investigations (cf. below for detailed references)
it is now well established that any integrable system (with finite
or infinite degrees of freedom) based on the higher rank algebras
FORMULA  or FORMULA  may be endowed with two distinct
types of integrable They are defined as those boundary
conditions that preserve the integrability of the system.
boundary conditions. These boundary conditions are known as
soliton preserving (SP), traditionally recognized in the framework
of integrable quantum spin chains (finite number of degrees of
freedom) {{cite:bf471455-a5c7-4bac-9226-102f28b01dd2}}–{{cite:5dddd414-8a82-4392-8a15-04f7c01301cd}}, and soliton non-preserving
(SNP) originally introduced in the context of classical integrable
field theories (infinite number of degrees of freedom)
{{cite:34bd4ed2-5ec2-459f-b0d8-a8b85888b4c6}}, and further investigated in {{cite:e142ce8b-d5d8-4e1d-b4dd-5ce0ce79fee0}}, {{cite:36e1bf2c-140e-4f21-8adb-bf68e3d57bda}}, {{cite:80bd3c78-5ad8-4f26-9376-c45fcd0c83fb}}. SNP boundary conditions have been also introduced and
studied for integrable quantum lattice systems {{cite:0be752ce-60be-48ef-9c5a-0e2ccb8a2c7e}},
{{cite:705459e8-ccfd-4513-8900-1037168d0de1}}–{{cite:ec160a97-9d8e-42d1-91fa-0b2f2c042066}}, and their quantum integrability was
first shown in {{cite:705459e8-ccfd-4513-8900-1037168d0de1}}. From the physical point of view
the SP boundary conditions oblige a particle-like excitation to
reflect to itself: no multiplet changing occurs. The SNP boundary
conditions, on the other hand, force an excitation to reflect to
its `conjugate', namely to an excitation carrying the conjugate
representation. From the algebraic perspective the two types of
boundary conditions are associated with two distinct algebras,
i.e. the reflection algebra {{cite:bf471455-a5c7-4bac-9226-102f28b01dd2}}, {{cite:8e215a10-1fb8-4e9a-bc9e-3c7900eabe4b}} and the
twisted Yangian respectively {{cite:4ad22678-6c17-4ea8-9ac0-11beaf01eb50}}, {{cite:5cce6606-5e68-4b83-84be-be06a054ea2b}}.
The study of the underlying algebraic structures defined by the
Yang-Baxter and reflection equations is in general of great
consequence, both at classical and quantum level, not only for
integrable systems per se, but also for other relevant problems in
theoretical physics. For instance, in the context of the AdS/CFT
correspondence {{cite:390174b2-3ad2-463a-9345-7d1e64853c3d}} it is known that from the string
theory side the relevant classical integrable model is a sigma
model (see e.g. {{cite:80c1869f-8f4d-461f-b291-724665d4adbb}}, {{cite:e12b1efd-a1a0-4998-a7c0-19f1f773f10f}}), that is a field theory with
infinite degrees of freedom. From the quantum gauge theory side on
the other hand the loop contributions are apparently given by
integrable quantum 1-D lattice models with a finite number of
degrees of freedom {{cite:2fe84949-373b-4c9c-a146-4f551336cf4c}}, {{cite:58896a5f-2c4f-4105-a779-17a6d2eba49a}}. As a consequence, a crucial
point would be the formulation of a discrete-quantum counterpart
of the aforementioned classical sigma model. In this respect, the
knowledge of the discrete-quantum Lax operator would facilitate
the derivation of the relevant Hamiltonian, and of the other
charges in involution, as well as of the exact nested Bethe Ansatz
equations. In fact, up to date only the asymptotic forms of the
would-be-exact Bethe Ansatz equations are known (see e.g.
{{cite:58896a5f-2c4f-4105-a779-17a6d2eba49a}}). Thus a rigorous derivation of these equations would
undoubtedly be of great physical significance, as proven when
corrections to the asymptotic regime are available {{cite:7ae8dc8b-acac-4183-82da-02a4bf231bac}}, {{cite:9a4f37ef-e135-4ca9-ad69-604480568eff}}.
In the frame of classical continuum theories the SNP boundary
conditions have been primarily investigated up to now
{{cite:34bd4ed2-5ec2-459f-b0d8-a8b85888b4c6}}–{{cite:80bd3c78-5ad8-4f26-9376-c45fcd0c83fb}}. Therefore it is of great importance
to further analyze the other set of boundary conditions, i.e. the
SP ones within this context. In the present study we examine both
SP and SNP boundary conditions for the classical generalized NLS
model, and by using Hamiltonian methods {{cite:b3c2ad7e-12a6-41de-bc04-2963098f1451}} we derive the
relevant integrals of motion, and also specify the corresponding
classical equations of motion. Note that in {{cite:65a6c491-9fc1-4f9a-9b40-07183a835862}} the
quantum FORMULA  NLS model on the half line was studied, based on
the reflection algebra (i.e. SP boundaries), primarily from the
point of view of the underlying symmetry algebras. It should be
stressed that although in most classical continuum theories the
SNP boundary conditions have been analyzed (see e.g. {{cite:34bd4ed2-5ec2-459f-b0d8-a8b85888b4c6}}, {{cite:36e1bf2c-140e-4f21-8adb-bf68e3d57bda}}, {{cite:80bd3c78-5ad8-4f26-9376-c45fcd0c83fb}}) this is the first time that such boundary conditions
are implemented within the generalized NLS model. Here we consider
the classical NLS model as a simple example, however our main
motivation is to search for all possible boundary conditions in
other classical theories such as affine Toda field theories,
principal chiral models and others. From the viewpoint of quantum
lattice models on the other hand the extensively analyzed boundary
conditions are the SP ones, thus we focus here mostly on the SNP
case for a lattice version of NLS. In particular, we consider a
suitable lattice version of the NLS model {{cite:4951eded-5d80-40fd-8ca5-ef4fe6d53387}}, {{cite:b5d1a94d-108f-4689-99ee-92a51cad4a77}}
with SNP boundary conditions, and we derive the exact spectrum and
the corresponding Bethe Ansatz equations.
The outline of this article is as follows: in the next section we
present the generic algebraic setting for classical models on the
full line and on the interval. More precisely we introduce the
classical Yang-Baxter equation and the underlying algebra for the
system on the full line. In the case of a system on the interval
we distinguish two types of boundary conditions based on the
classical versions of reflection algebra (SP) and twisted Yangian
(SNP). Next the NLS model on the full line is reviewed and an
explicit derivation of the local integrals of motion by solving
the auxiliary linear problem {{cite:b3c2ad7e-12a6-41de-bc04-2963098f1451}} is presented. In section 3
being guided by the same logic and adopting Sklyanin's formulation
{{cite:8e215a10-1fb8-4e9a-bc9e-3c7900eabe4b}} we derive the integrals of motion of the FORMULA 
NLS system on the interval with SP and SNP boundary conditions.
Moreover, the corresponding classical equations of motion are
obtained for various boundary conditions. In addition the usual
NLS model with a reflecting impurity is investigated in the same
spirit. In section 4 a suitable lattice version of the NLS model
is investigated. After a brief review on the model with periodic
boundary conditions we deal with the model with open boundaries.
First the spectrum and Bethe Ansatz equations are derived for the
usual lattice NLS. Finally, the SNP boundary conditions are
considered for the generalized NLS system. The first non-trivial
local integral of motion is explicitly specified for particular
choice of boundary conditions, and the spectrum and Bethe Ansatz
equations are deduced for the simplest boundaries.

The general setting
The line of attack which will be adopted for the study of the
FORMULA  NLS model with integrable boundaries is based on the
solution of the so called auxiliary linear problem {{cite:b3c2ad7e-12a6-41de-bc04-2963098f1451}}. It
is therefore necessary to recall at least the basics regarding
this formulation. Let FORMULA  be a solution of the following set of
equations
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  being in general
FORMULA  matrices with entries functions of complex valued
fields, their derivatives, and the spectral parameter FORMULA . The
monodromy matrix from (REF ) may be then written as:
FORMULA 
The fact that FORMULA  is
a solution of equation (REF ) will be extensively used
subsequently for obtaining the relevant integrals of motion.
Compatibility conditions of the two differential equation
(REF ), () lead to the zero curvature condition
FORMULA 
giving rise to the corresponding
classical equations of motion of the system under consideration.
There exists an alternative description, known as the FORMULA  matrix
approach (Hamiltonian formulation). In this picture the underlying
classical algebra is manifest in analogy to the quantum case as
will become quite transparent later. Let us first recall this
method for a general classical integrable system on the full line.
The existence of the classical r-matrix, satisfying the classical
Yang-Baxter equation
FORMULA 
guarantees
the integrability of the classical system. Indeed, consider the
operator FORMULA  satisfying
FORMULA 
Making use of the latter equation one may readily show for a
system in full line:
FORMULA 
i.e. the system is
integrable, and the charges in involution –local integrals of
motion– may be attained by the expansion of the object FORMULA , based essentially on the fact that FORMULA  also
satisfies (REF ).
Our main aim here is to consider the FORMULA  NLS model on the
interval. For this purpose we follow the line of action described
in {{cite:b3c2ad7e-12a6-41de-bc04-2963098f1451}}, but using Sklyanin's formulation for the system on
the interval or on the half line (see also {{cite:76bd1fa1-cc36-490e-b6b5-be0060b2a1b5}} for the sine
Gordon on the half line). We briefly describe this process below
for any classical integrable system on the interval. In this case
one has to derive a modified transition matrix FORMULA , based
on Sklyanin's formulation and satisfying the following Poisson
bracket algebras FORMULA , FORMULA , i.e. classical
versions of the reflection algebra and twisted Yangian
respectively. It will be convenient for our purposes here to
introduce some useful notation. Let
FORMULA 
In general FORMULA  can be any matrix
such that FORMULA , for instance FORMULA  is also
a possible choice (see e.g. {{cite:34bd4ed2-5ec2-459f-b0d8-a8b85888b4c6}}). Then the defining
relations describing the classical reflection algebra and the
twisted Yangian respectively, may be written in the following
compact formNote that the classical versions of the
reflection equation and the twisted Yangian are provided in
general by more involved expressions for generic FORMULA  matrices. In
the present study we focus on FORMULA  matrices satisfying
FORMULA  (FORMULA ), and in this case (REF ), are valid.:
FORMULA 
To construct the generating function of the integrals of
motion one also needs FORMULA -number representations of the algebra
FORMULA  (FORMULA ) satisfying (REF ) for SP and
SNP respectively, and also
FORMULA 
The modified
transition matrices, compatible with the corresponding algebras
FORMULA  are given by the following expressions
{{cite:8e215a10-1fb8-4e9a-bc9e-3c7900eabe4b}}:
FORMULA 
and the generating function of the involutive
quantities is defined as
FORMULA 
Due to (REF )
it can be shown that (REF )
FORMULA 
Technical details on the proof of
classical integrability are provided in Appendix A.
By expanding FORMULA  in powers of FORMULA  one
recovers the local integrals of motion of the considered system,
and this is achieved in the subsequent sections. Among the local
integrals of motion there exist naturally the Hamiltonian, which
also provides information regarding the corresponding equations of
motion. This is in fact the formulation we are going to assume for
the NLS system on the half line, although an alternative strategy
would be to derive the modified Lax pair, compatible with the
boundary conditions chosen, and hence the associated equations of
motion (see e.g. {{cite:34bd4ed2-5ec2-459f-b0d8-a8b85888b4c6}}). Nonetheless, the rigorous
derivation of the modified Lax pair is essentially based on the
existence of local integrals of motion {{cite:b3c2ad7e-12a6-41de-bc04-2963098f1451}}, therefore the
viewpoint adopted here is arguably the most natural.

Classical local integrals of motion
The main objective in this section is to solve the auxiliary
linear problem for the generalized NLS model on the interval.
Before however we proceed to the study of the model on the
interval we shall briefly review the system on the full line. In
any case, these results will be relevant for the boundary case as
well.
The generalized NLS on the full line
We shall hereafter focus on the FORMULA  NLS model. Consider the
classical FORMULA  matrix
FORMULA 
FORMULA  is the permutation operator,
and FORMULA . The Lax pair for
the generalized NLS model is given by the following expressions
{{cite:b3c2ad7e-12a6-41de-bc04-2963098f1451}}:
FORMULA 
where (see also {{cite:1c9a30ab-9c43-400b-b817-edbdb660c30d}})
FORMULA 
and FORMULA  satisfyThe Poisson
structure for the generalized NLS model is defined as:
FORMULA 
:
FORMULA 
From the zero curvature condition (REF ) the classical
equations of motion for the generalized NLS model are entailed
i.e.
FORMULA 
It is clear
that for FORMULA  the equations of motion of the usual NLS model are
recovered.
As already mentioned to obtain the local integrals of motion of
NLS one has to expand FORMULA  (REF ) in powers of
FORMULA  {{cite:b3c2ad7e-12a6-41de-bc04-2963098f1451}}. Let us consider the following ansatz for
FORMULA  as  FORMULA
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is off diagonal
matrix i.e. FORMULA , and FORMULA  is purely
diagonal FORMULA . Also
FORMULA 
Inserting the latter expressions
(REF ) in (REF ) one may identify the coefficients
FORMULA  and FORMULA  (see Appendix B for a detailed
analysis). Notice that as FORMULA  the only non
negligible contribution from FORMULA  comes from the
FORMULA  term, and is given by:
FORMULA 
It is thus sufficient
to determine the coefficients FORMULA  in order to extract
the relevant local integrals of motion (see also {{cite:1c9a30ab-9c43-400b-b817-edbdb660c30d}}).
Indeed solving (REF ) one may easily obtain:
FORMULA 
From the latter formulae (REF )
and taking into account (REF ), (REF ) the local
integrals of motion of NLS may be readily extracted from FORMULA , i.e.
FORMULA 
The corresponding familiar
quantities for the generalized NLS are given by:
FORMULA 
and apparently
FORMULA 
Again in the special case where FORMULA  the well
known local integrals of motion for the usual NLS model on the
full line are recovered.

The generalized NLS on the interval
After the review on the NLS on the full line we can come to our
main concern, which is the evaluation of the integrals of motion
after implementing integrable boundary conditions. We shall
investigate subsequently both SP and SNP boundary conditions.
SP boundary conditions
Let us first consider the NLS model with SP boundary conditions.
For this purpose FORMULA -number solutions of the classical reflection
equation are needed. A general non-diagonal FORMULA  matrix satisfying
the classical reflection equation is given by (see also
{{cite:0be752ce-60be-48ef-9c5a-0e2ccb8a2c7e}})
FORMULA 
Apparently in the case where FORMULA  a diagonal solution is
recovered
FORMULA 
The more general diagonal FORMULA 
matrix is given by (see also e.g. {{cite:5ba85f99-cf9c-4b33-8f45-3c306967ab91}}, {{cite:7775ec26-1955-4493-b1af-656cb6490f18}})
FORMULA 
The solution (REF ) may be
seen as a special case of (REF ) for FORMULA .
Henceforth we set FORMULA , and we focus on the case with
diagonal boundaries provided by (REF ), (REF ), and
FORMULA . Also FORMULA . The quantity under expansion
is
FORMULA 
where the objects with `hat' are simply
the same as before but now FORMULA . The technical
details of the relevant computations are presented in Appendix C.
(I) Let us first consider the simple boundary conditions
described by (REF ). Gathering all the information provided
by equations (REF ), and by explicit computations concerning
the FORMULA  expansion (see Appendix C, case (b) for
fore details) we conclude that the integrals of motion for the NLS
on the interval are given by:
FORMULA 
the quantity
FORMULA  as expected is trivial, as in the case of sine-Gordon model
on the half line. Recall that in the whole line the quantity FORMULA 
corresponds essentially to the momentum, which is not a conserved
quantity any more. To obtain the number of particles and the
Hamiltonian we simply have to divide by  FORMULA
FORMULA 
It
is clear that different choices of boundary conditions lead to
distinct boundary contributions to the integrals of motion. A more
detailed description of complicated diagonal and non diagonal
boundaries is presented in Appendix C. Notice also that for FORMULA 
the boundary Hamiltonian presented in {{cite:8e215a10-1fb8-4e9a-bc9e-3c7900eabe4b}} is
recovered. Of course we could have considered Shcwartz boundary
conditions at FORMULA  i.e. FORMULA  and
trivial right boundary FORMULA  (that is the system is
considered on the half line), then the boundary terms appearing at
FORMULA  in the expressions of the integrals of motion would
disappear.
As already mentioned the equations of motion will be derived based
on the existence of a boundary Hamiltonian rather than on the
existence of a modified Lax pair. In general, among the integrals
of motion there exists a Hamiltonian (REF ) such that the
relations below
FORMULA 
give rise to the classical equations of motion. Indeed considering
the Hamiltonian FORMULA  (REF ), (REF ), we end up
with the following set of equations
FORMULA 
In general the boundary
Hamiltonian for the generalized NLS model may be expressed as
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the boundary
potential. One may write the equations of motion for a generic
boundary potential FORMULA . It is clear that the bulk part
remains intact as in (REF ), and what is only modified is
the boundary conditions at FORMULA  depending naturally on
FORMULA , i.e.
FORMULA 
Two more examples of diagonal
boundaries are presented below:
(II) Consider the boundary conditions described by
(REF ). The corresponding contributions to the integrals of
motion due to the presence of non trivial boundaries are computed
in Appendix C, case (b). In this case the boundary potential (see
(REF )) is given by
FORMULA 
and
consequently the boundary conditions for the equations of motion
at FORMULA  now read as:
FORMULA 
The previous case (I) may be seen as a special
case of the more general diagonal boundary conditions by setting
FORMULA . Ultimately, one would like to investigate the SP
boundary conditions in the context of affine Toda field theories,
something that has not been achieved up to date. In this case, it
is naturally anticipated that the corresponding equations of
motion should explicitly depend on the parameters FORMULA , contrary to the case analyzed in {{cite:34bd4ed2-5ec2-459f-b0d8-a8b85888b4c6}}, where no
extra free parameters associated to the boundaries occur. It
is also worth stressing that in the context of integrable spin
chains the integers FORMULA  appear explicitly in the
corresponding Hamiltonian as well as in the associated symmetry of
the model. More precisely, it was shown in {{cite:7775ec26-1955-4493-b1af-656cb6490f18}} that the
open spin chain with diagonal boundary conditions associated to
integers FORMULA  is FORMULA  invariant (or
FORMULA  invariant in the
trigonometric case). The symmetry breaking for the quantum FORMULA 
NLS model due to presence of non trivial integrable boundaries is
also discussed in {{cite:65a6c491-9fc1-4f9a-9b40-07183a835862}}.
(III) Finally we consider the case where FORMULA  (Appendix C, case (c)). The boundary potential in this case is
FORMULA 
and apparently we end up with simple Dirichlet boundary
conditions
FORMULA 
Note that the FORMULA  case in particular was investigated
classically on the half line in {{cite:babb0074-f359-4c24-8e87-0d138989d75f}}, whereas the NLS
equation on the interval was studied in {{cite:b930e89f-bfc7-4d75-b7d6-d82c42e9539e}}.

SNP boundary conditions
Recall that in this case the object under consideration,
compatible with the underlying algebra, that is the classical
version of the twisted Yangian, is
FORMULA 
and we choose here for simplicity FORMULA . Note
however that a generic solution of the classical twisted Yangian
is given by any matrix FORMULA  (see {{cite:71d5f2fc-f72d-42c5-9f5c-dd876eddf95d}}). We shall
choose in what follows FORMULA . By
expanding (REF ) in powers of FORMULA , along the
lines described in Appendix C, explicit expressions for the
integrals of motion are entailed (see (REF ), (REF )).
It is worth pointing out, bearing in mind expressions
(REF ), that non-local contributions to the integrals of
motion arise. This is quite an intriguing fact and it definitely
merits further investigation, which however will be undertaken in
a forthcoming work. Nevertheless, based on the formulas
(REF ), (REF ) we may explicitly express the first
non-trivial conserved quantity, which is somehow a `modified'
number of particles, i.e.
FORMULA 
Notice that the
SNP boundary modify dramatically the number of particles (see
(REF ), (REF )). Indeed, the variation due to the
integrable boundary conditions is not limited to the addition of
certain boundary terms to the bulk quantity, as is customary, but
it gives rise to an alteration of the bulk expression itself. This
is a very interesting and definitely non-conventional aspect that
has not been encountered before, especially in the context of
continuum integrable theories. Note finally that in the special
case FORMULA  the `modified' number of particles reduces to the usual
number of particles, which is a conserved quantity for the FORMULA 
NLS model with diagonal boundary conditions (see (REF )).

The NLS model with reflecting impurity
A physically relevant example will be discussed in what follows.
More precisely we shall restrict our attention to the usual NLS
model, and within the framework described in the previous section
we shall examine the problem of reflecting impurities attached to
the ends of the system. According to {{cite:8e215a10-1fb8-4e9a-bc9e-3c7900eabe4b}} one may
consider a more general solution of the reflection equation.
Consider the classical Lax operator satisfying
FORMULA 
recall
FORMULA  is given in (REF ). For example consider the
FORMULA  operator associated to the classical Lie algebra
FORMULA :
FORMULA 
where apparently FORMULA  obey
FORMULA 
FORMULA  being the usual
antisymmetric tensor. One may easily express the later matrix in
terms of canonical variables FORMULA , i.e.
FORMULA 
Degenerate cases of the matrix above are for
instance the Toda chain and the DST model (see e.g.
{{cite:22fd50e4-6589-4f35-85ae-169e3d1cefc3}} and references therein) with Lax operators
given by
FORMULA 
Consider the following generating function of the integrals of motion
FORMULA 
FORMULA  is a generic `dynamical' type solution of the classical
reflection equation {{cite:8e215a10-1fb8-4e9a-bc9e-3c7900eabe4b}}, i.e.
FORMULA 
FORMULA  can be any solution of (REF ), FORMULA  are any
FORMULA -number solutions of classical reflection equation. Note that
the Poisson brackets for FORMULA  in the classical reflection
equation are considered with respect to the canonical variables
FORMULA . Here we shall deal with a simple
example, that is FORMULA  and FORMULA  and
FORMULA  given by (REF ) (for simplicity set FORMULA )
then it is clear that
FORMULA 
Finally the boundary contribution to the Hamiltonian
is given by (see also Appendix B)
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
where FORMULA . Analogous expressions to
(REF ) are given for FORMULA , in particular FORMULA : FORMULA . Based on the latter expressions
the boundary part of the Hamiltonian may be deduced. Indeed,
bearing in mind that the boundary potential is given by FORMULA  and taking into account
(REF ), (REF ) we conclude
FORMULA 
where we define
FORMULA 
and as
expected the boundary contribution of the Hamiltonian is solely
expressed in terms of the canonical variables FORMULA  as well as the boundary values of the fields
and their derivatives (see also {{cite:8eda5727-5c03-4e98-bbbc-c570844f6798}} for a similar
treatment of the classical sine–Gordon model).

A quantum lattice version of NLS
Review on periodic lattice NLS
Let us first present the general algebraic framework associated to
the discrete quantum version of the NLS model, introduced and
studied for the periodic case in {{cite:4951eded-5d80-40fd-8ca5-ef4fe6d53387}}, {{cite:b5d1a94d-108f-4689-99ee-92a51cad4a77}}. In the
quantum level the key object as is well known is the FORMULA 
operator satisfying:
FORMULA 
where the FORMULA -matrix associated to the
FORMULA  Yangian is
FORMULA 
and obeys of course the Yang–Baxter equation
{{cite:b10d1ffe-823b-40c1-bc53-5ba39c0ba7a7}}, {{cite:29e40458-dc3c-49d3-8ef0-eca556ec2622}}, i.e.
FORMULA 
We
shall focus in this and the subsequent section in the simplest
FORMULA  Yangian. In this case a simple solution of equation
(REF ) is given by (on a detailed description of the
underlying algebra see e.g. {{cite:4951eded-5d80-40fd-8ca5-ef4fe6d53387}}, {{cite:b5d1a94d-108f-4689-99ee-92a51cad4a77}})
FORMULA 
where the FORMULA 
satisfy canonical commutation relations
FORMULA 
In fact this solution may
be thought of as the quantum version of the NLS. Indeed the
classical limit of the FORMULA  operator (REF ) gives FORMULA 
(REF ) (for further details see {{cite:4951eded-5d80-40fd-8ca5-ef4fe6d53387}}). Set FORMULA  then as  FORMULA
FORMULA 
note that FORMULA , and FORMULA  is
equivalent to FORMULA  (REF ) of NLS up to a gauge
transformation i.e.
FORMULA 
It is more
convenient for our purposes here to use FORMULA  with a
rescaled spectral parameter matrix. Let us multiply (REF ) by
FORMULA  and also set FORMULA 
then the rescaled FORMULA  matrix may be written as:
FORMULA 
FORMULA .
For the special value FORMULA  the FORMULA  operator
reduces to a projector
FORMULA 
Due to the fact that the algebra
(REF ) is equipped with a coproduct one may build tensorial
representations and construct a spin chain like system with
periodic boundary conditions, by introducing the quantities
FORMULA 
with
FORMULA  being essentially the quantum analogous of
(REF ) and apparently by virtue of (REF )
FORMULA 
By expanding FORMULA  around FORMULA  we find the corresponding involutive
quantities exactly as in the classical case {{cite:4951eded-5d80-40fd-8ca5-ef4fe6d53387}}. It is
easy to see that due to (REF ) FORMULA , then one finds
(for more details we refer the reader to {{cite:4951eded-5d80-40fd-8ca5-ef4fe6d53387}})
FORMULA 
with
FORMULA 
From the latter objects one may derive lattice
versions of the classical quantities (REF ),
FORMULA 
Notice that the expressions above are symmetric to FORMULA 
so one can set FORMULA  and obtain the familiar
expressions for the NLS system (REF ). Note also that the
existence of an obvious pseudo-vacuum allows the implementation of
Bethe ansatz techniques {{cite:7b7bcaeb-0515-45c1-a337-9b03d16607ee}}, {{cite:4951eded-5d80-40fd-8ca5-ef4fe6d53387}}, however our aim here is
to extend such computations in the case of the integrable open
spin chain, which is discussed in the subsequent sections.

Open lattice NLS
We come now to the case with open boundary conditions, which is
our main concern. The underlying algebra in this case is defined
by the reflection equation {{cite:bf471455-a5c7-4bac-9226-102f28b01dd2}}
FORMULA 
The tensorial type solutions of the reflection
equation as well known is given by {{cite:8e215a10-1fb8-4e9a-bc9e-3c7900eabe4b}}
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
is FORMULA -number solution of the reflection equation with the most
general form given by {{cite:4bede07c-c400-4793-981c-3533387dfa8b}}
FORMULA 
Note that the explicit expression of FORMULA  is given by:
FORMULA 
The corresponding generating function of the
conserved quantities of the open system is
FORMULA 
FORMULA , FORMULA  is
again a FORMULA  number solution of the reflection equation. And due to
(REF ) it is clear that integrability of the quantum system is
ensured i.e.
FORMULA 
In the remaining of this section we specify the spectrum of the
lattice NLS model with diagonal boundary conditions by means of
the Bethe ansatz technique {{cite:7b7bcaeb-0515-45c1-a337-9b03d16607ee}}. Focusing on diagonal
boundaries should be sufficient given that in {{cite:0be752ce-60be-48ef-9c5a-0e2ccb8a2c7e}} the
spectral equivalence between systems with diagonal and non
diagonal boundaries was shown by means of appropriate gauge
transformations, but only for spin chains associated to the
fundamental representation of FORMULA . Presumably there exist
suitable gauge transformations for the system under consideration,
such that the spectral equivalence is guaranteed. We shall further
comment on this point on a separate publication. When both
boundaries are diagonal there exists an obvious reference state
for the transfer state
FORMULA 
Based on this
observation one may in a straightforward manner derive the
spectrum and the corresponding Bethe ansatz equations. We provide
directly the results avoiding the technical details (for a
detailed description we refer the reader to {{cite:8e215a10-1fb8-4e9a-bc9e-3c7900eabe4b}}). The
spectrum of the transfer matrix is given by
FORMULA 
where we define
FORMULA 
The corresponding Bethe ansatz equations arising as analyticity
conditions on the spectrum are:
FORMULA 
Notice that although we deal with an
open spin chain and one would expect a leading order of FORMULA , we
see a leading order of FORMULA  exactly as in the periodic case. The
same phenomenon occurs in the boundary lattice Liouville model
{{cite:c2450023-dc02-4528-ba08-281019be8bf0}}, and is presumably associated to the degenerate
nature of the FORMULA  matrix (see also similar comments in
{{cite:22fd50e4-6589-4f35-85ae-169e3d1cefc3}}). It should be emphasized that the Bethe
ansatz equations (REF ) are of particular significance given
that their thermodynamic analysis yields for instance
consequential information regarding the corresponding bulk as well
as boundary exact FORMULA  matrices of the model.

The generalized lattice NLS
We shall deal in what follows with the lattice quantum version of
the FORMULA  NLS model. Recall that the FORMULA  Yangian FORMULA  matrix,
solution of the Yang–Baxter equation (REF ), is given in
(REF ). The relevant FORMULA  operator in this case is
given by (see also {{cite:4951eded-5d80-40fd-8ca5-ef4fe6d53387}})
FORMULA 
Notice
that here we set implicitly FORMULA . It will
be also useful for the following to define
FORMULA 
we choose here FORMULA , which gives rise to the following explicit form:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA . Recall that in general we
could have chosen any FORMULA  such that FORMULA . We shall
focus hereafter in the case of SNP boundary conditions, given that
they are not so widely known compared to the SP ones, especially
in the context of integrable lattice models. The main objective in
this section is to derive the exact spectrum and the corresponding
Bethe ansatz equations. Note that in the SNP case the underlying
algebra is defined by the following relation, (twisted Yangian,
see e.g. {{cite:4ad22678-6c17-4ea8-9ac0-11beaf01eb50}})
FORMULA 
and
in analogy to the classical case we define
FORMULA 
The generating
function of the quantum integrals of motion in this case is
defined as:
FORMULA 
FORMULA  are FORMULA -number solutions of the twisted Yangian
(REF ). In fact, it was shown in {{cite:71d5f2fc-f72d-42c5-9f5c-dd876eddf95d}} that any matrix
FORMULA  is a solution of the twisted Yangian. In Appendix D
an explicit computation of local integrals of motion for
particular boundary conditions is presented. Based on these
findings we present the explicit form of the boundary momentum in
the case where FORMULA , i.e.
FORMULA 
We could have of course considered FORMULA , which is the case will be examined
subsequently, but for the sake of simplicity we considered the
aforementioned boundary conditions, which from a technical point
of view are much easier to deal with. By comparing the bulk
momentum given in Appendix D (REF ) with (REF ) we
conclude that the periodic terms in (REF ) are replaced
essentially by the last two boundary terms in (REF ), whereas
the bulk part remains intact. Following the logic of (REF ),
it is expected that the expression (REF ) should be a
regularization of the continuum generalized NLS model momentum
with particular SNP boundary conditions, exactly as it happens for
the periodic NLS model (indeed compare the bulk continuum
expression (REF ) with the discrete periodic analogous
(REF )). Comments on higher conserved charges may be also
found in Appendix D.
To deduce the spectrum and Bethe ansatz equations of the
generalized NLS model with SNP boundary conditions we shall
restrict our attention to another simple case i.e.
FORMULA . Again the spectral equivalence between
systems with diagonal and non-diagonal boundaries is discussed in
{{cite:71d5f2fc-f72d-42c5-9f5c-dd876eddf95d}}, {{cite:ec160a97-9d8e-42d1-91fa-0b2f2c042066}}, for spin chains associated to the fundamental
representation of FORMULA . The first step toward the
diagonalization of the transfer matrix (REF ) is the
derivation of a reference state. Indeed, in this case there exists
an obvious reference state, that is
FORMULA 
The corresponding eigenvalue may be easily derived using the fact
that FORMULA  and consequently FORMULA  satisfy
FORMULA 
Taking into account the latter relation we
conclude that the actions of the transfer matrix on the pseudo
vacuum provides the following eigenvalue:
FORMULA 
where we define
FORMULA 
The
functions FORMULA  are essentially `boundary' contributions to the
spectrum.
To determine the general eigenvalue form we shall adopt the
analytical Bethe ansatz formulation {{cite:ca7856ed-dd33-4c0c-906f-91b97fd60b74}}. The basic
assumption within this framework is that the structure of any
eigenvalue is similar to the pseudo-vacuum eigenvalue i.e.
FORMULA 
The so called
dressing functions FORMULA  may be explicitly determined by imposing
certain physical and algebraic requirements, such as analyticity,
crossing, etc. We do not give all the details of the formulation,
(for a more detailed description of the process we refer the
reader to {{cite:f5fba11e-47f8-42ac-8ec4-952e7d9dabbd}}, {{cite:0be752ce-60be-48ef-9c5a-0e2ccb8a2c7e}}, {{cite:71d5f2fc-f72d-42c5-9f5c-dd876eddf95d}}), but the explicit expressions
for the dressing functions are given by:
FORMULA 
and in particular for  FORMULA
FORMULA 
Finally Bethe ansatz equations follow as
analyticity requirements upon the spectrum, and they are written
explicitly as:
(i) N=2n+1:
FORMULA 
with FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and define FORMULA .
(ii) N=2n: In this case the Bethe ansatz equations for FORMULA  are the same as in the previous case. What is only
modified is the last set of equations, which takes the form:
FORMULA 
Such type of boundary conditions
were first introduced in {{cite:705459e8-ccfd-4513-8900-1037168d0de1}} for the FORMULA  spin
chain, whereas generalizations investigated in {{cite:0be752ce-60be-48ef-9c5a-0e2ccb8a2c7e}}, {{cite:71d5f2fc-f72d-42c5-9f5c-dd876eddf95d}}
from the physical (Bethe ansatz) as well as the algebraic point of
view. The associated symmetries were studied in detail in
{{cite:71d5f2fc-f72d-42c5-9f5c-dd876eddf95d}}, {{cite:9019ed57-5889-4499-a2d6-2a0db710ef14}}, {{cite:ec160a97-9d8e-42d1-91fa-0b2f2c042066}}, while in {{cite:9019ed57-5889-4499-a2d6-2a0db710ef14}} both SP and
SNP boundary conditions were examined in parallel. The interesting
observation is that the RHS of the equations above in the case
where FORMULA  coincide with the ones associated to the
FORMULA  algebra. In any case the Bethe ansatz equations
(REF ) are somehow `folded' compared to the usual FORMULA 
ones. This is expected given that folding occurs at the algebraic
level as well (Dynkin diagrams), and only the subalgebra invariant
under charge conjugation survives after the implementation of
these rather unconventional boundary conditions (see also relevant
comments in {{cite:71d5f2fc-f72d-42c5-9f5c-dd876eddf95d}}). The case of SP boundaries can be also
treated along the same lines, and the entailed spectrum and Bethe
ansatz equations will have the usual FORMULA  structure (the
expressions are omitted here for brevity). More precisely the LHS
of the Bethe ansatz equations will have exactly the same form as
the usual FORMULA  BAE for an open chain (see e.g. {{cite:5ba85f99-cf9c-4b33-8f45-3c306967ab91}}, {{cite:7775ec26-1955-4493-b1af-656cb6490f18}}, {{cite:0be752ce-60be-48ef-9c5a-0e2ccb8a2c7e}}), while the RHS will depend explicitly on the actions of the
diagonal entries of the FORMULA  on the
pseudo-vacuum.

Discussion
To summarize, SP and SNP boundary conditions were studied for the
classical generalized NLS model, and the boundary integrals of
motion as well as the relevant classical equations of motion were
explicitly derived. This was the first time, to our knowledge,
that SNP boundaries were implemented in the context of the
generalized NLS model. Nevertheless, there are still several open
questions especially regarding the locality of some of the
integrals of motion for particular choices of left/right
boundaries, which however will be left for future investigations.
In the same spirit the usual (FORMULA ) NLS model with reflecting
impurities was also analyzed. Moreover, a suitable lattice version
of the generalized NLS model was considered and the SNP boundary
conditions were implemented, given that in general they are much
less studied in this context. For this choice of boundary
conditions we were able to specify the first non-trivial local
integral of motion i.e. the `boundary momentum'. We also derived
the spectrum and Bethe Ansatz equations for the simplest
left/right boundaries.
Although SP boundary conditions are somehow the obvious ones in
the framework of lattice integrable models, they have not been
really considered up to now in classical continuum integrable
theories. Therefore, it will be our next goal to impose the SP
boundary conditions to other well known classical systems such as
(massless) affine Toda field theories, principal chiral models,
etc. In addition, the investigation of the generalized (m)KdV
hierarchies {{cite:ed74e043-d555-406a-9d35-ce1c16cf6208}} with integrable boundaries is another very
interesting direction to pursue together with their quantization
into an appropriate lattice version (see e.g. {{cite:81724f5b-3c67-442f-aa43-5d654739e6f8}} and
references therein). Once this point is clarified, the study of
the underlying dynamical symmetries constrained by integrable
boundary conditions could be discussed in full generality along
the lines described in {{cite:a812d7b7-5fce-43d8-83f6-f9667d06bf3f}}, and this would definitively
shed new light on the character of the different integrable
boundary conditions. More precisely, it would be of great
consequence to examine how the so called hidden symmetries
constructed in {{cite:a812d7b7-5fce-43d8-83f6-f9667d06bf3f}} are modified in the presence of
non-trivial integrable boundaries, and in particular in the case
of (quantum) twisted Yangians. Finally, an interesting direction
to pursue is the explicit derivation of the modified Lax pairs by
means of the `boundary' integrals of motion. We hope to report on
all these issues in forthcoming publications.

Appendix
In this appendix the classical integrability for models with both
types of boundary conditions, SP and SNP, is reviewed. The first
step in order to prove the classical integrability is to show that
the quantities introduced in (REF ) are indeed
representations of the algebras defined by (REF ). To
achieve this we shall need in addition to (REF ) the
following set of algebraic relations emerging essentially from
(REF ), i.e.
FORMULA 
Our aim now is to show
that (REF ) are satisfied by (REF ):
FORMULA 
and making use of (REF ), (REF ) and
(REF ) we end up to (REF ). Recall also that
FORMULA -number solutions of the above equations satisfy the following
FORMULA 
which is equivalent to (REF ).
We may now show exploiting (REF ) and (REF ) the
classical integrability (REF ). Indeed consider the
following object
FORMULA 
then taking the trace in both spaces 1 and 2, and considering
the defining relations (REF ), (REF ) we end up with
FORMULA 
Finally moving appropriately the factors of the products within
the trace and using (REF ) it is straightforward to show
FORMULA 
and this concludes our proof.
Similar arguments hold also in the case of dynamical boundaries
discussed in section 3.3.

Appendix
We present here some technical details on the derivation of the
conserved quantities for the generalized NLS model on the full
line. The first step is to insert the ansatz (REF ) in
equation (REF ). Then we separate the diagonal and off
diagonal part and obtain the following expressions:
FORMULA 
where the superscripts FORMULA  denote the
diagonal and off diagonal part of the product FORMULA .
Recall that FORMULA  then it is straightforward to obtain:
FORMULA 
Substituting the latter expressions
(REF ) in (REF ), we obtain
FORMULA 
And recalling that
the leading contribution in the expansion of (FORMULA ), –FORMULA 
is given in (REF )– as FORMULA  is coming
from the FORMULA  term we conclude:
FORMULA 
Due to (REF ) it is obvious
that in this case it is sufficient to derive the coefficients
FORMULA  only. In any case one can show that the coefficients
FORMULA  satisfy the following equations:
FORMULA 
Finally setting FORMULA  and using (REF ) we find
expressions for FORMULA  reported in (REF ). In the
case with integrable boundary conditions, we shall need in
addition to (REF ) the following objects:
FORMULA 

Appendix
In what follows we evaluate the boundary terms contributing to the
Hamiltonian for right and left boundary described by the more
general, diagonal and non-diagonal, solutions of the reflection
equation (SP boundary conditions). Moreover, for the SNP boundary
conditions we identify the corresponding integrals of motions, and
we explicitly evaluate the first non-trivial charge.
SP boundary conditions
We shall expand the generic object (REF ) keeping of course
only diagonal contributions. More precisely, as in the bulk case
due to the fact that the leading order is FORMULA  as
FORMULA  the only non negligible part is coming from
the FORMULA  terms, hence we shall only consider such
contributions:
FORMULA 
Again considering only the
contribution of the term FORMULA  as FORMULA 
we end up with the following expression
FORMULA 
Recall from (REF ) that the boundary
contribution lies basically in the logarithmic function, hence one
has to expand the log i.e.
FORMULA 
where FORMULA , provide essentially the boundary
contribution to the integrals of motion (plus possible total
derivatives from the bulk part) for the left right boundary
respectively. The interesting observation is that the boundary
contribution decouples nicely to terms associated to left and
right boundary separately, i.e. no mixing occurs
FORMULA 
(a) We first consider generic non diagonal boundary
conditions described by (REF ). One can explicitly evaluate
FORMULA  for the generic case:
FORMULA 
In fact it is
clear from the expansion of the left and right boundary
contribution that FORMULA .
Given that there is an overall derivative from the bulk part of
FORMULA , giving rise to a boundary term (FORMULA ), we conclude that the boundary contribution to the
conserved quantity FORMULA  (i.e. the Hamiltonian) is given by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the boundary
potential, and recall that FORMULA  is given by (REF ). For
diagonal boundary, terms proportional to FORMULA  apparently
disappear, and the Hamiltonian reduces to (REF ). For a
purely antidiagonal boundary only terms proportional to FORMULA 
survive, all the other terms disappear.
(b) The more general diagonal boundary conditions are
described by (REF ). We associate the integers FORMULA 
and the free parameters FORMULA  to the right/left boundaries.
In this case from the expansions (REF ) and taking into
account (REF ), (REF ) we find:
FORMULA 
similar expressions of
course hold for FORMULA , i.e. FORMULA : FORMULA . Taking into account
(REF ), (REF ) and derivative contribution from the
bulk (FORMULA ) we conclude
that the boundary contribution to the Hamiltonian is given by:
FORMULA 
Note that
when FORMULA  one recovers the diagonal limit of the more
general case (a).
(c) Finally the case where FORMULA  may be
treated in the same spirit. In this case we find that
FORMULA 
and the corresponding boundary
contribution to the Hamiltonian is given by
FORMULA 

SNP boundary conditions
Recall that in this case the object under consideration is given
in (REF ), also we consider for simplicity FORMULA  and we choose FORMULA . Before
we proceed with the evaluation of the integrals of motion let us
first introduce some useful notation
FORMULA 
recall FORMULA , and also one may easily compute that
FORMULA 
We shall need the following
contributions in order to evaluate the corresponding integrals of
motion:
FORMULA 
Also
bearing in mind that the leading contributions in the considered
expansion, as FORMULA , are coming from FORMULA  and
FORMULA  for FORMULA  we may write:
FORMULA 
Gathering all the information
given above we end up with the following expression
FORMULA 
Finally taking into
account the information provided above
(REF )–(REF ) we may express the first non-trivial
integrals of motion as:
FORMULA 
Notice that in general due to the presence of FORMULA  in
(REF ) non-local terms seem to arise in the higher
integrals of motion, which is quite an unusual issue and shall be
addressed elsewhere. Nevertheless, a straightforward computation
of the higher charges, based on the explicit expression
(REF ), may prove the locality or not of the higher
integrals of motions. Moreover, the presence of FORMULA 
alters the structure of the bulk part of the integrals as well.
The latter integral of motion (REF ) gives rise to a
`modified' number of particles, FORMULA .

Appendix
In this appendix we shall evaluate the first integrals of motion
of the quantum discrete FORMULA  NLS model with SNP boundary
conditions. This model may be also regarded as a higher rank
algebraic extension of the FORMULA  DST model (see e.g.
{{cite:22fd50e4-6589-4f35-85ae-169e3d1cefc3}}), holding a special place between the FORMULA 
quantum spin chains –extensions of the Heisenberg model– and the
FORMULA  generalization of the Toda chain. To explicitly specify the
local integrals of motions of the model with open boundary
conditions we shall, as usual, consider the asymptotic expansion
of the generating function FORMULA . We shall focus
here on the simple case where both left and right boundaries are
given by FORMULA , and
effectively we shall expand
FORMULA 
and recall FORMULA  is given by (REF ).
Indeed after expanding in powers of FORMULA  we obtain
FORMULA 
where
the quantities FORMULA  are defined below
FORMULA 
In the expressions above all the lower indices denote the site of
the spin chain, while the upper indices denote the component of
the FORMULA  dimensional vector fields.
We may easily obtain first the bulk integrals of motion by
considering the expansion FORMULA . Indeed for the bulk case after simply taking the
trace of FORMULA  we obtain
FORMULA 
The quantities identified as the number of
particles and the momentum in the NLS model are given by the
following expressions
FORMULA 
and more precisely
FORMULA 
We come now to the open NLS model, and we
consider the expansion of (REF ). The first charge of the
open model is zero, that is the number of particles is not a
conserved quantity anymore. The second charge is given by
FORMULA 
and corresponds to the momentum FORMULA , which is obviously modified due to the presence
of the open boundaries. The third charge again is trivial,
involving only boundary terms. We do not compute any higher
conserved charges, but we may rather safely conjecture that the
only non-trivial conserved charges are the even ones.
