Starting with an adjoint pair of operators, under suitable abstract versions of standard PDE hypotheses, we consider the Weyl FORMULA -function of extensions of the operators. The extensions are determined by abstract boundary conditions and we establish results on the relationship between the FORMULA -function as an analytic function of a spectral parameter and the spectrum of the extension. We also give an example where the FORMULA -function does not contain the whole spectral information of the resolvent, and show that the results can be applied to elliptic PDEs where the FORMULA -function corresponds to the Dirichlet to Neumann map.

Introduction
The theory of boundary value spaces associated with symmetric operators
has its origins in the work of Kočubeĭ {{cite:2c2192ff-18ae-4e74-b6f5-a044f42f40fc}} and Gorbachuk and Gorbachuk
{{cite:e32ba93d-32e7-4944-a730-940cb35444b1}} and has been the subject of intense activity in the former
Soviet Union, with major contributions from many authors. While we cannot
undertake a comprehensive survey of the literature here, we recommend that the
reader consult the works of Derkach and Malamud who developed the theory of the Weyl-FORMULA -function in the context of boundary value spaces (e.g. {{cite:76066574-4a1d-4bc4-8136-e5d13b2ddf41}}, {{cite:e9415f3c-08de-4c90-be1c-32335e6c9e9a}}); the work of V.A. Mikhailets (e.g. the very elegant application of the theory of boundary value
spaces by Mikhailets and Sobolev {{cite:d820edd8-9305-4c94-9a63-423273ef1242}} to the common eigenvalue
problem for periodic Schrödinger operators); the work of Kuzhel and Kuzhel
(e.g. {{cite:0c7bcd58-431a-4727-8776-15baacec9d3d}}, {{cite:a8641504-be29-43b4-8272-8653c1267e60}}); the work of Brasche, Malamud and Neidhardt
(e.g. {{cite:a24e131e-03ee-46ad-9f91-e70071a449ec}}); the work of Storozh (in particular, {{cite:7d56a2db-cf1f-432d-8074-8a90f8596eb5}}) and the recent work of Kopachevskiĭ and Kreĭn {{cite:fc243f00-bfb0-4748-b12f-833b47208642}} and Ryzhov {{cite:a1431c88-bba2-4057-82e6-e99f6d20fc17}} on abstract Green's formulae, again Ryzhov {{cite:b920068d-483c-4e3d-9623-053d632565aa}} on functional models and Posilicano {{cite:f62bb376-3a81-4a20-a83b-a16dba58d0bf}} characterising extensions and giving some applications to PDEs.
Adjoint pairs of second order elliptic operators, their extensions and boundary value problems were studied in the paper of Vishik {{cite:65a97c1d-4cf4-485f-9dd9-9c6c3b766459}}. For adjoint pairs of abstract operators, boundary triplets were introduced by Vainerman {{cite:fe6c1eb1-31be-4857-b930-ff97cdbfd787}}
and Lyantze and Storozh {{cite:69a85033-7d57-4580-8907-48bb8624d422}}. Many of the results proved for the symmetric case, such
as characterising extensions of the operators and investigating spectral properties via the
Weyl-FORMULA -function, have subsequently been extended for this situation: see, for instance,
Malamud and Mogilevski {{cite:07bb1826-feee-421e-94bf-2a67f16f993f}} for adjoint pairs of operators, Langer and Textorius
{{cite:f9626f38-935a-468b-8a36-c0f79dae4036}} and Malamud {{cite:53af094d-6708-4da7-988b-28cfbd1a32b1}} for adjoint pairs of contractions, and Malamud and Mogilevski
{{cite:8c6a1330-9ec1-4718-b0e0-f1d6e19f56e8}}, {{cite:6271b5d5-733b-4ec1-9997-6128e4860a07}} for adjoint pairs of linear relations.
For the case of sectorial operators and their FORMULA -functions we should mention
especially the work of Arlinskii {{cite:6bc99233-561a-4c67-8f54-081afdd1797c}}, {{cite:a0d24f13-fbf9-4459-b423-ab3f71bbf941}}, {{cite:32112cfa-6364-4ee5-a9fe-b99010d8c410}}
who uses sesquilinear form methods.
The approach using adjoint pairs of operators does not
require any assumption that the operators be sectorial. The price which must be paid
for this is that there are other hypotheses (e.g. non-emptiness of the resolvent set of
certain operators or, in our approach, an abstract unique continuation assumption)
which must be verified before this approach can be applied.
In the context of PDEs there has also been extensive work on Dirichlet to Neumann maps, also
sometimes known as Poincaré-Steklov operators, especially in the inverse problems
literature. These operators have physical meaning, associating, for instance, a surface
current to an applied voltage. For some applications of them to quantum networks we refer
to recent papers by Pavlov et al. {{cite:7af80e0d-e134-440a-a015-04a084dca82c}} and {{cite:38214c96-3d08-4ab4-8615-fae627f877c0}}. These maps
are, in some sense, the natural PDE realization of the abstract FORMULA -function
which appears in the theory of boundary value spaces. Amrein and Pearson {{cite:8c216df8-f327-45e4-8d3e-1db10f294137}} generalised several results from the classical Weyl-FORMULA -function for the one-dimensional Sturm-Liouville problem to the case of Schrödinger operators, calling them FORMULA -functions, in particular they were able to show nesting results for families of FORMULA -functions on exterior domains.
However there have been relatively few applications of the theory of boundary value spaces to PDEs. A chapter in Gorbachuck and Gorbachuk {{cite:e32ba93d-32e7-4944-a730-940cb35444b1}} deals with
a PDE on a tubular domain by reduction to a system of ODEs with operator
coefficients, and there are some papers which deal with special perturbations of
PDE problems which result in symmetric operators with (crucially) finite
deficiency indices, e.g. the very recent paper of Brüning,
Geyler and Pankrashkin {{cite:88c7bbbb-4108-4ec9-b84e-10dac400d6bf}}. The case of symmetric operators with infinite deficiency indices is studied by Behrndt and Langer in {{cite:b1457fe5-882a-4c25-aa6a-1debcedc4572}}. However for symmetric elliptic PDEs a
concrete realization of the boundary value operators whose existence is
guaranteed by the abstract theory, and a precise description of the relationship
between the abstract FORMULA -function and the classical Dirichlet to Neumann map,
requires a technique due to Vishik {{cite:65a97c1d-4cf4-485f-9dd9-9c6c3b766459}} and Grubb {{cite:d3c18027-e0a7-488b-8b21-306fbbee6d57}} in the choice of the
boundary value operators which we describe in this paper.
In this paper we consider the non-symmetric case. Using the setting of boundary triplets from Lyantze and Storozh
{{cite:69a85033-7d57-4580-8907-48bb8624d422}}, we introduce an FORMULA -function and prove
the following results:
i.
the relationship between poles of the FORMULA -function as an analytic
function of a spectral parameter and eigenvalues of a corresponding operator
determined by abstract boundary conditions, under a new abstract unique
continuation hypothesis which is natural in the context of PDEs;
ii.
results concerning behaviour of the FORMULA -function near the
essential spectrum;
iii.
a proof that the FORMULA -function does not contain the whole spectral information of the resolvent, by consideration of a
Hain-Lüst problem;
iv.
results concerning the analytic behaviour of Dirichlet to Neumann
maps for elliptic PDEs, though these have also been obtained recently in a
concrete way by F. Gesztesy et al. {{cite:62189b7b-dd02-4f04-a1be-dcb797882f07}}.


Basic concepts and notation
Throughout, we will make the following assumptions:

FORMULA  and FORMULA  are closed densely defined operators on a Hilbert space FORMULA .

FORMULA  and FORMULA  are an adjoint pair, i.e. FORMULA  and FORMULA .

Whenever considering FORMULA  as a linear space it will be equipped with the graph norm. Since FORMULA  is closed, this
makes FORMULA  a Hilbert space.

Proposition 2.1 (Lyantze, Storozh '83). For each adjoint pair of closed densely defined operators on FORMULA ,
there exist “boundary spaces” FORMULA , FORMULA  and “boundary operators”
FORMULA 
such that for FORMULA  and FORMULA  we have an abstract Green formula
FORMULA 
The boundary operators FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  are bounded with respect to the graph norm and surjective. Moreover, we have
FORMULA 
The collection FORMULA  is called a boundary triplet for the adjoint pair FORMULA .

The proof in Russian is in {{cite:69a85033-7d57-4580-8907-48bb8624d422}}. For the more general situation of linear relations a proof in English can be found in {{cite:6271b5d5-733b-4ec1-9997-6128e4860a07}}.
Remark 2.2 Using this setting, in {{cite:6271b5d5-733b-4ec1-9997-6128e4860a07}} Malamud and Mogilevskii go on to define Weyl FORMULA -functions and FORMULA -fields associated with boundary triplets and to obtain Kreĭn formulae for the resolvents. In the same spirit we introduce FORMULA -functions and what we call the solution operator. In our setting, these will depend on a parameter given by an operator FORMULA . To take account of this technical difference and to keep this paper as self-contained as possible we will develop the full theory in Sections 2 and 3 here, noting that similar definitions and results can be found in {{cite:6271b5d5-733b-4ec1-9997-6128e4860a07}}.

Definition 2.3 
We consider the following extensions of FORMULA  and FORMULA : Let FORMULA  and FORMULA  and define
FORMULA 
In the following, we will always assume FORMULA , in particular FORMULA  will be a closed operator.
For FORMULA , we define the FORMULA -function via
FORMULA 
and for FORMULA , we define
FORMULA 

Lemma 2.4 FORMULA  and FORMULA  are well-defined.

We prove the statement for FORMULA . Suppose FORMULA , then there exists FORMULA  such that FORMULA . To see this, choose any FORMULA  such that FORMULA . Let FORMULA . Then FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Now assume FORMULA  for some FORMULA .
Then FORMULA . As FORMULA , there exists FORMULA  such that FORMULA .
Then FORMULA , so FORMULA , in particular, FORMULA .

 The solution operator  FORMULA
Definition 3.1 For FORMULA , we define the operator FORMULA  by
FORMULA 
i.e. FORMULA .

Lemma 3.2 
FORMULA  is well-defined for FORMULA .

For FORMULA , choose any FORMULA  such that FORMULA . Let
FORMULA . Then FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
so a solution to (REF ) exists and is given by
FORMULA 
for any FORMULA  such that FORMULA .
Moreover, the solution to (REF ) is unique: Suppose FORMULA  and FORMULA  are two solutions. Then
FORMULA , so FORMULA  and FORMULA .
As FORMULA , FORMULA .
Proposition 3.3 
Let FORMULA . The map from FORMULA  given by FORMULA  is analytic.

Fix FORMULA . Now choose FORMULA  in the proof of Lemma REF . Then
FORMULA 
which is analytic in FORMULA .
Lemma 3.4 
Let FORMULA , FORMULA  and
FORMULA 
Then FORMULA  and FORMULA  are Hilbert spaces and the operator FORMULA  with FORMULA  is closed as an operator from
FORMULA  to FORMULA .

Obviously, FORMULA  and FORMULA  are norms induced by scalar products. It remains to prove completeness.
Since FORMULA  is continuous, FORMULA  is a closed subspace of FORMULA , hence complete.
Assume FORMULA  is a Cauchy sequence in FORMULA . Then FORMULA  is Cauchy in FORMULA  and converges to FORMULA  and
FORMULA  is Cauchy in FORMULA  and converges to FORMULA . As FORMULA  is continuous in the graph norm and
FORMULA  is given by FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
so FORMULA , i.e. FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Therefore, FORMULA  is complete and the calculation also proves closedness of FORMULA .
Remark 3.5 As FORMULA , we have FORMULA , so
FORMULA 
gives an equivalent norm on FORMULA .

Corollary 3.6 If FORMULA , then FORMULA  is continuous. In particular, FORMULA  is continuous.

This follows from the Closed Graph Theorem. See for example {{cite:da96a103-bf1e-4201-a9bc-fa0019426ac5}}.
For the case FORMULA , we now want to give a representation of the adjoint of FORMULA .
We start with an abstract result:
Lemma 3.7 
Let FORMULA  be a closed subspace of the Hilbert space FORMULA  and let FORMULA  be another Hilbert space.
Suppose FORMULA  is invertible and FORMULA  is such that
FORMULA 
Then FORMULA .

Let FORMULA  and FORMULA  the orthogonal projection. Then we have FORMULA  or FORMULA  on FORMULA .
Therefore, FORMULA  on FORMULA .
Theorem 3.8 Assume FORMULA .
Then FORMULA .

Let FORMULA , FORMULA . Then (REF ) implies
FORMULA 
so FORMULA . On the other hand, let FORMULA .
We need to show FORMULA . Let FORMULA  and FORMULA 
for FORMULA . Then
FORMULA 
so FORMULA . Since the adjoint of the
resolvent is the resolvent of the adjoint,
FORMULA .
Surjectivity of FORMULA  then gives the result.
Proposition 3.9 Assume FORMULA  and let FORMULA . Then the adjoint of
FORMULA  is given by FORMULA ,
FORMULA 

Choose FORMULA , FORMULA . Then by (REF ),
FORMULA 
As FORMULA  is continuous and continuously invertible, both FORMULA  and FORMULA 
exist and FORMULA .
Let FORMULA . Since FORMULA , FORMULA  is arbitrary.
Now, by the above calculation,
FORMULA 
Therefore, by Lemma REF , we have
FORMULA .
Remark 3.10

The factor FORMULA  is somewhat artificial and comes from the choice of the norm in FORMULA .

Note that since (REF ) only holds for FORMULA , FORMULA  is not defined on the whole of
FORMULA . Obviously the operator
FORMULA 
is a continuous extension of FORMULA  to FORMULA  and FORMULA . Here, FORMULA  denotes the orthogonal projection from FORMULA  onto FORMULA .



Isolated eigenvalues and poles of the FORMULA -function
For a number of results in what follows we will require an abstract unique continuation hypothesis. We say that the operator FORMULA  satisfies the unique continuation hypothesis if
FORMULA 
Similarly, FORMULA  satisfies the unique continuation hypothesis if
FORMULA 
Whenever either of these conditions is required, it will be stated explicitly.
Remark 4.1 Note that these assumptions are satisfied in the PDE case under fairly general conditions on the operator and the domain (c.f. for example {{cite:2e5657bf-d5fc-434f-90e6-fa84e2b357b9}}).

Lemma 4.2 
Assume the unique continuation hypothesis holds for FORMULA . Then the range of FORMULA  is dense in FORMULA .

Suppose there exists FORMULA  such that FORMULA 
for all FORMULA . This implies FORMULA  and
FORMULA . The unique continuation hypothesis together with (REF ) implies FORMULA .
The following definition and Laurent series expansion of the resolvent are standard and can be found in {{cite:feb544cc-d882-4f04-a80f-a1422323ae79}}. They will be required in a later proof.
Proposition 4.3 
Let FORMULA  be a closed operator on a Banach space FORMULA , FORMULA  an isolated point in the spectrum of FORMULA  and FORMULA  be a closed path in the resolvent set of FORMULA  separating FORMULA  from the rest of the spectrum.
The spectral projection associated with FORMULA  is defined by
FORMULA 
We also define the eigennilpotent associated with  FORMULA
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
For FORMULA  in a neighbourhood of FORMULA  the Laurent series expansion of the resolvent is given by
FORMULA 

Our aim is now to determine the relationship between the behaviour of the FORMULA -function FORMULA  as an analytic function and isolated eigenvalues of the operator FORMULA .
Theorem 4.4 
Let FORMULA  be an isolated eigenvalue of finite algebraic multiplicity of the operator FORMULA . Assume the unique continuation hypothesis holds for FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Then FORMULA  is a pole of finite multiplicity of FORMULA 
and the order of the pole of FORMULA  at FORMULA  is the same as the order of the pole of FORMULA  at FORMULA .

We use the following representation of the FORMULA -function using the resolvent:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is any element in FORMULA  such that FORMULA . Obviously,
any pole of the FORMULA -function has to be a pole of at least the same order of the resolvent.
It remains to show that the order of the singularity of the pole of the resolvent is preserved despite the presence of the other operators on the right hand side. To do this, we look at the Laurent series expansion.
Let FORMULA  be an isolated eigenvalue of finite algebraic multiplicity of the operator FORMULA . In this case, there exists FORMULA  such that the resolvent has a pole of order FORMULA  at FORMULA  and, using the notation from Proposition REF , for FORMULA  in a neighbourhood of FORMULA  the singular part in the representation of the resolvent (REF ) is given by
FORMULA 
In particular, FORMULA  and FORMULA . Therefore, there exists FORMULA  such that FORMULA  and FORMULA  solves
FORMULA 
i.e. FORMULA  is an eigenfunction of FORMULA  with eigenvalue FORMULA .
We want to show that after substituting the expansion of the resolvent (REF ) into FORMULA , the most singular term is non-trivial, i.e. FORMULA  for some FORMULA .
First, we show that there exists FORMULA  satisfying FORMULA  such that the problem FORMULA  is solvable and FORMULA .
To see this, choose FORMULA  such that FORMULA  and approximate it by FORMULA  which is possible by Lemma REF . Since FORMULA  is continuous, FORMULA  and for FORMULA  sufficiently large, FORMULA . Simply choose FORMULA .
Now assume FORMULA  solves FORMULA  and FORMULA . Then FORMULA  and
FORMULA 
giving a contradiction.
Now we can choose FORMULA  in (REF ) as the solution FORMULA  we have just found. Then FORMULA  contains the term
FORMULA 
so the most singular term in is of order FORMULA  and given by
FORMULA 
Now FORMULA  is a (non-trivial) eigenfunction of FORMULA  so by the unique continuation hypothesis, FORMULA .
Under slightly stronger hypotheses, we will show next that
isolated eigenvalues of FORMULA  correspond precisely to isolated poles of the FORMULA -function.
We start by proving some identities involving the FORMULA -function.
For the FORMULA -functions associated with two different boundary conditions we have the following identity:
Proposition 4.5 For FORMULA , we have on  FORMULA
FORMULA 
Correspondingly, we have
FORMULA 

We prove (REF ). Then (REF ) follows by applying FORMULA  to both sides. Let FORMULA , then
FORMULA , so
FORMULA 
since FORMULA .
The next proposition gives a representation of the FORMULA -function in terms of the resolvent.
Proposition 4.6 Let FORMULA . Then on  FORMULA
FORMULA 

Given FORMULA , choose FORMULA  such that FORMULA .
Set
FORMULA 
Then FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA 
is the unique function with these properties, as FORMULA . Moreover, FORMULA . Choose FORMULA .
Then
FORMULA 
We now give a representation of the resolvent in terms of the FORMULA -function. This type of formulae are usually called Kreĭn's formulae.
Theorem 4.7 Let FORMULA , FORMULA . Then
FORMULA 

Let FORMULA . Set FORMULA . Since FORMULA , we have
FORMULA . Then
FORMULA 
Set FORMULA . Then, by (REF ), FORMULA 
and FORMULA . Therefore,
FORMULA 
Remark 4.8 If FORMULA , then we have
FORMULA 

The case FORMULA  is particularly simple:
Corollary 4.9 Let FORMULA , FORMULA . Then
FORMULA 

We our now ready to prove our main result.
Theorem 4.10 Let FORMULA . We assume that FORMULA  and that
there exist operators FORMULA  such that FORMULA  or FORMULA .
Then FORMULA  is an isolated eigenvalue of finite algebraic multiplicity of the operator FORMULA  if and only if
FORMULA  is a pole of finite multiplicity of FORMULA .
In this case, the order of the pole of FORMULA  at FORMULA  is the same as the order of the pole of FORMULA  at FORMULA .

Let FORMULA  be an isolated eigenvalue of finite algebraic multiplicity FORMULA  of the operator FORMULA .
Then, since FORMULA , and FORMULA  is analytic in FORMULA  by Proposition REF ,
(REF ) implies that FORMULA  must
have a pole of at least order FORMULA  at FORMULA , while (REF ) implies that the pole is at most of order FORMULA .
Similarly, if FORMULA  has a pole of order FORMULA  at FORMULA , (REF ) implies that the resolvent of FORMULA  must have a pole of order
at least FORMULA  at FORMULA , while (REF ) implies that the pole is at most of order FORMULA . Therefore, FORMULA  is an eigenvalue of FORMULA 
(c.f. for example {{cite:feb544cc-d882-4f04-a80f-a1422323ae79}}).
Remark 4.11 Note that the assumption that FORMULA  can be chosen such that FORMULA  implies the unique continuation property for FORMULA .
To see this, let FORMULA .
Then FORMULA , so FORMULA  and FORMULA , so FORMULA .


Behaviour of the FORMULA -function near the essential spectrum
By the essential spectrum of an operator FORMULA , we denote all points in the spectrum that are not isolated eigenvalues of finite multiplicity. In this section we will investigate what can be said about the essential spectrum from the behaviour of the FORMULA -function. In the case of symmetric operators, these questions have been addressed by Brasche, Malamud and Neidhardt in {{cite:a24e131e-03ee-46ad-9f91-e70071a449ec}}.
Theorem 5.1 
Let FORMULA  such that there exists FORMULA , with FORMULA  for all FORMULA .
Suppose there is a linear subspace FORMULA  such that FORMULA  is dense
in FORMULA  and

for every FORMULA  we can find FORMULA  satisfying

FORMULA ,

FORMULA ;


FORMULA  is surjective;

for all FORMULA , FORMULA ;

 FORMULA

Then for all FORMULA  the weak limits FORMULA  exist.
Moreover,
FORMULA 
Here, the left hand equality is to be interpreted as
FORMULA 

Remark 5.2 In the case of an elliptic PDE in an unbounded domain with finite boundary, the subspace FORMULA  could consist of all finitely
supported functions.
Condition (4) is our main assumption, while (1) is a kind of inverse trace theorem and (2) and (3) are technical assumptions.

Given FORMULA , choose FORMULA  such that FORMULA . Set
FORMULA 
Then FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Green's identity (REF ) for any FORMULA  gives
FORMULA 
Setting FORMULA  and inserting our expression for FORMULA  on the left hand side, the equation becomes
FORMULA 
Now assume FORMULA . Since FORMULA , we can take limits on the left hand side. The assumption that
FORMULA  is surjective then gives weak convergence
of FORMULA  in FORMULA  and we get
FORMULA 
Furthermore,
FORMULA 
Since
FORMULA  is surjective, equality of the weak limits of the resolvent implies equality of the weak limits of the FORMULA -function.
We would like to prove a converse of Theorem REF , i.e. determine the behaviour of the resolvent from that of the FORMULA -function. However, we only get the following partial results:
Proposition 5.3 Assume the unique continuation hypothesis holds for FORMULA  and FORMULA  and that the weak limits
FORMULA 
exist for every FORMULA  and that there exists some FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
Then FORMULA .

Remark 5.4 Note that in {{cite:a24e131e-03ee-46ad-9f91-e70071a449ec}} it is shown that for symmetric operators FORMULA  implies FORMULA .

As in the proof of Theorem REF , we arrive at equation (REF ). By assumption, the limit on the right hand side exists.
Assume that FORMULA . Then we can take limits on the left hand side and get equation (REF ) with the l.h.s. equal to 0
contradicting FORMULA . Thus FORMULA  and FORMULA  is not in the isolated point spectrum, as the weak limits of the FORMULA -function exist which would contradict Theorem REF .
Remark 5.5 The problem in getting a stronger statement lies in the fact that the
FORMULA -function does not contain all the singularities of the resolvent, but
only those that are contained on a certain subspace. We plan to
discuss this
topic and other properties related to the continuous spectrum and
behaviour of the FORMULA -function in a forthcoming paper.

In what follows, we will show that for a block operator matrix it is possible
to have a dense proper subspace FORMULA  for which the weak limit of the FORMULA -functions exists,
but the weak limit for the resolvents does not exist. We also hope that this example,
demonstrating the calculation of the FORMULA -function in a non-trivial block
operators matrix setting, is of independent interest.
A block matrix-differential operator related to the Hain-Lüst operator
Let
FORMULA 
where FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  are FORMULA -functions, and the domain of
the operator is given by
FORMULA 
Also let
FORMULA 
It is then easy to see that
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
Consider the operator
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .
It is known (see, e.g., {{cite:d74419cd-f4b0-4014-83e9-e6c1c2c889c0}}) that
FORMULA . This result is independent
of the choice of boundary conditions.
We now calculate the function FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
for FORMULA . In our calculation we assume
that FORMULA . The condition
FORMULA  yields the equations
FORMULA 
which, in particular, give
FORMULA 
The linear space FORMULA  is therefore
spanned by the functions
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are solutions of the initial value problems
consisting of the differential equation (REF ) equipped
with initial conditions
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
A straightforward calculation shows that
FORMULA 
Note that the FORMULA  depend on FORMULA  and FORMULA  but that the
FORMULA -dependence is suppressed in the notation, except when necessary.
Another elementary calculation now shows that
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
As an aside, notice that all these expressions contain a denominator
FORMULA  and that
FORMULA  is an eigenvalue precisely when
this denominator is zero.
We now fix FORMULA , let FORMULA ,
and consider the limits FORMULA .
For simplicity we consider the case in which FORMULA  is injective and
FORMULA  for some FORMULA  and we suppose that FORMULA  for
FORMULA  for some small FORMULA . In
this case the coefficient
FORMULA 
is well defined as a function of FORMULA  for all FORMULA  in a
punctured neighbourhood in FORMULA  of the point FORMULA : in particular,
FORMULA  is identically zero for all FORMULA ,
for all FORMULA . Consequently the solutions
FORMULA  and FORMULA  are well defined for all
FORMULA , for all FORMULA  in a neighbourhood of FORMULA .
The FORMULA -function may have an isolated pole at some point
FORMULA  near FORMULA  if FORMULA 
happens to be zero; such a pole will be an eigenvalue of the operator
FORMULA  embedded in the essential spectrum and therefore
a more complicated singularity of FORMULA .
Embedded eigenvalues may occur even without the hypothesis that FORMULA 
vanishes on some subinterval FORMULA : see {{cite:8ce2b5a3-94ba-43a4-a22a-7182a43b6181}}.
However embedded eigenvalues are atypical and are generally destroyed by
an arbitrarily small perturbation to the problem. In the absence of any
embedded eigenvalues, FORMULA  will be analytic in the neighbourhood
FORMULA  of the point FORMULA  and we shall have,
in the sense of norm limits,
FORMULA 
For the resolvent, suppose that
FORMULA 
Then FORMULA  must satisfy
FORMULA 
together with the boundary conditions, which is a uniquely solvable problem
in the absence of embedded eigenvalues (recall that FORMULA  is
well defined as a function of FORMULA  for all FORMULA  in a neighbourhood of
FORMULA ). In particular, FORMULA  does not have a singularity of
any type at FORMULA .
Now FORMULA  is given by
FORMULA 
We examine the question of existence of weak limits of the type described
in Theorem REF :
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  lie in some space FORMULA 
and FORMULA . Evidently the first component FORMULA 
of the vector FORMULA  will cause
no problems whatever FORMULA  we choose:
FORMULA 
will be analytic in a neighbourhood of FORMULA . Thus we turn to
the second component FORMULA . Take FORMULA  to be the space of
two-component smooth functions. Suppose that FORMULA  is differentiable at
FORMULA  with FORMULA . If FORMULA  is given by (REF )
then the inner product
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  has a limit as FORMULA  tends to
zero from above; similarly as it has a (generally different) limit as
FORMULA  tends to zero from below. The difference of the limits is
FORMULA 
However the FORMULA -function has no singularity at all. We have therefore
constructed an example in which the resolvent has non-equal weak limits
but the FORMULA -function has equal norm limits.
It is worth emphasizing that for this example,
FORMULA 
This is not enough to avoid the phenomenon that some singularities of the
resolvent are `canceled' in the FORMULA -function.

Relatively bounded perturbations
Let FORMULA  be a symmetric operator in FORMULA  and FORMULA  be a boundary value space for FORMULA  (c.f. {{cite:e32ba93d-32e7-4944-a730-940cb35444b1}}).
Assume that FORMULA  is symmetric with the following properties:

FORMULA  is relatively FORMULA -bounded with relative bound less than 1

FORMULA  is relatively FORMULA -bounded with relative bound less than 1

We will show that in this case it is sufficient to consider boundary operators only associated with the symmetric part FORMULA  of the operator FORMULA .
Example 6.1 Let FORMULA  be a symmetric second order elliptic differential operator on a smooth domain FORMULA  with FORMULA .
If FORMULA , only operators of the form FORMULA , FORMULA  satisfy these conditions. If FORMULA , FORMULA  can also involve
first order terms.

Let FORMULA  and FORMULA . By the assumptions on FORMULA , FORMULA 
and FORMULA , FORMULA . with FORMULA .
Moreover, FORMULA  and FORMULA . For FORMULA , let FORMULA  and define
FORMULA  and FORMULA  as before with the boundary operators FORMULA  now only associated with the symmetric part of FORMULA .
Then all the results of Section  hold in this situation as well and the
proofs are identical as the specific form of the Green formula plays no role in their derivation. Therefore, we have
Theorem 6.2 Let FORMULA  be an isolated eigenvalue of finite algebraic multiplicity of the operator FORMULA . Assume the unique continuation hypothesis holds for FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Then FORMULA  is a pole of finite multiplicity of FORMULA 
and the order of the pole of FORMULA  at FORMULA  is the same as the order of the pole of FORMULA  at FORMULA .

Proposition 6.3 For FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
Correspondingly, we have
FORMULA 

Proposition 6.4 Let FORMULA . Then
FORMULA 

Proposition 6.5 Let FORMULA , FORMULA . Then
FORMULA 

Theorem 6.6 Let FORMULA  and assume there exist operators FORMULA  such that FORMULA  or
FORMULA .
Then FORMULA  is an isolated eigenvalue of finite algebraic multiplicity of the operator FORMULA  if and only if
FORMULA  is a pole of finite multiplicity of FORMULA .
In this case, the order of the pole of FORMULA  at FORMULA  is the same as the order of the pole of FORMULA  at FORMULA .


Application to PDEs
The theory previously developed is not immediately applicable to the usual boundary value problems arising in PDEs. The reason is the following:
Consider the case of the Laplacian FORMULA  with FORMULA  where FORMULA  is a smooth bounded domain. The usual Green's identity is given by
FORMULA 
However, we want identity (REF ) to hold for all FORMULA  which in general is not even a subset of FORMULA . Therefore, the integral FORMULA  is not well-defined for all these functions.
The aim of this section is to show that by suitably modifying the boundary operators, our previous results hold for elliptic differential operators of order FORMULA . This idea was first used by Vishik {{cite:65a97c1d-4cf4-485f-9dd9-9c6c3b766459}}. So as not to obscure the ideas with technicalities and notation we will only consider a first order perturbation of the Laplacian. The same method is applicable to any elliptic operator satisfying the conditions given in {{cite:d3c18027-e0a7-488b-8b21-306fbbee6d57}} by Grubb. In fact, all the results required in the following are taken from that paper.
Let
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is a smooth bounded domain.
Let
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
Then for FORMULA  we have
FORMULA 
It is easy to check that
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
Let FORMULA  be the restriction of FORMULA  satisfying Dirichlet boundary conditions.
Similarly, let FORMULA . Then by elliptic regularity, FORMULA .
Without loss of generality, assume that FORMULA  (if not, this can be achieved by a translation). By {{cite:d3c18027-e0a7-488b-8b21-306fbbee6d57}},
FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Definition 7.1 For FORMULA  define FORMULA  by
FORMULA 
and let FORMULA  satisfy
FORMULA 

Definition 7.2 For FORMULA , let
FORMULA 
and for FORMULA , let
FORMULA 

Remark 7.3

The operators FORMULA  and FORMULA  are well-defined (c.f. {{cite:d3c18027-e0a7-488b-8b21-306fbbee6d57}}).

FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the Dirichlet to Neumann maps associated with FORMULA  and FORMULA  (with FORMULA ).

The operator FORMULA  regularizes FORMULA  in the following sense: FORMULA  for FORMULA , therefore
FORMULA  is determined only by the regular part of FORMULA  lying in FORMULA . In fact we have:


Theorem 7.4 (Grubb 1968) 
Equip FORMULA  and FORMULA  with the graph norm. Then FORMULA  is continuous and surjective. The same is true for
FORMULA . Moreover, for all FORMULA , FORMULA  we have
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  denotes the duality pairing between FORMULA  and FORMULA .

See {{cite:d3c18027-e0a7-488b-8b21-306fbbee6d57}}.
To obtain an abstract Green formula of the form (REF ), we now need to rewrite the duality pairings as scalar products in FORMULA . Since FORMULA  and FORMULA  are both infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, there exists a unitary isomorphism FORMULA . Then FORMULA  is also a unitary isomorphism and
FORMULA 
Theorem 7.5 For FORMULA  let
FORMULA 
and for FORMULA  let
FORMULA 
Then
FORMULA 
Moreover,

FORMULA  and FORMULA  are surjective for  FORMULA

FORMULA  and FORMULA  are continuous with respect to the graph norm for  FORMULA

given FORMULA , there exist FORMULA  such that FORMULA  and FORMULA  and FORMULA  such that FORMULA  and FORMULA  (inverse trace theorem).


The Green identity follows from the previous theorem and the definition of FORMULA .
Properties FORMULA  and FORMULA  are consequences of FORMULA  and FORMULA  being continuous and surjective onto FORMULA  and FORMULA  and FORMULA  being continuous and surjective onto FORMULA  (c.f. {{cite:d3c18027-e0a7-488b-8b21-306fbbee6d57}}).
The inverse trace property FORMULA  follows from the corresponding property for FORMULA  and FORMULA  and FORMULA  and FORMULA , respectively (c.f. {{cite:d3c18027-e0a7-488b-8b21-306fbbee6d57}}).
Remark 7.6

All conditions we required in the previous sections on the boundary operators are satisfied by FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA . So all the results on the corresponding FORMULA -functions hold.

Note that FORMULA  is the operator with Dirichlet boundary conditions - the Friedrichs extension of FORMULA , while FORMULA  is the Kreĭn extension of FORMULA .

By exchanging the roles of FORMULA  and FORMULA  it is possible to express the Neumann boundary condition in the form FORMULA  for bounded FORMULA .

An abstract form of this procedure for regularizing the boundary operators has been introduced by Ryzhov {{cite:a1431c88-bba2-4057-82e6-e99f6d20fc17}}.
