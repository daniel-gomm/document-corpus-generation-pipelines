Zassenhaus conjecture, Kimmerle conjecture,
torsion unit, partial augmentation, integral group ring

We investigate the possible character values of
torsion units of the normalized unit group of the
integral group ring of Mathieu sporadic group
FORMULA . We confirm the Kimmerle conjecture on prime graphs for this
group and specify the partial augmentations for possible
counterexamples to the stronger Zassenhaus conjecture.

Introduction, conjectures and main results
Let FORMULA  be the normalized unit group of the
integral group ring FORMULA  of a finite group FORMULA .   A long-standing
conjecture of H. Zassenhaus   (ZC)   says that every torsion unit
FORMULA  is conjugate within the rational group algebra
FORMULA  to an element in FORMULA  (see {{cite:6c21c651-d95e-4d08-9932-4ac11b21367e}}).
For finite simple groups the main tool for the investigation of the
Zassenhaus conjecture is the Luthar–Passi method, introduced in
{{cite:6cb1edc7-0c68-4c4d-8207-c9b923860893}} for the case of FORMULA  and then applied in
{{cite:3acbf338-e793-47c1-887b-dbf3a329253d}} for the case of FORMULA .
Later M. Hertweck in {{cite:24aae0c8-355e-4324-b5d7-0a404f649117}} extended
the method and applied it to FORMULA .
The same method has also proved to be useful for some groups containing
non-trivial normal subgroups. For some recent results we refer to
{{cite:cba77769-4831-4570-8903-d803f6679bc7}}, {{cite:ff40e2ea-a4d0-480b-b0bb-8098b823677a}}, {{cite:8f21ec9c-925b-42cb-8403-0dc20f2b3cd7}}, {{cite:a0a7fb55-3857-413a-8ad2-d9afd864cb26}}, {{cite:24aae0c8-355e-4324-b5d7-0a404f649117}}, {{cite:8a70861f-eabc-40d3-9cd0-a2d120e367c1}}.
Some related properties and weakened variations of the
Zassenhaus conjecture can be found in
{{cite:a5a45545-458f-457e-bbac-7a511e47e46d}}, {{cite:d25f28cb-7daa-4802-b91a-2d0b6de17a2a}}, {{cite:58e99250-4292-4338-b2e1-f3ef4a93852b}}.
To define the conjectures we will investigate, and describe the
methods we will use, we introduce some notation. By FORMULA  we
denote the set of all primes dividing the order of FORMULA . The
Gruenberg–Kegel graph (or the prime graph) of FORMULA  is the graph
FORMULA  with vertices labeled by FORMULA  and
an edge from FORMULA  to FORMULA  if there is an element of order FORMULA  in
FORMULA . In {{cite:58e99250-4292-4338-b2e1-f3ef4a93852b}} W. Kimmerle proposed the
following weakened variation of the Zassenhaus conjecture:

(KC)       If FORMULA  is a finite group then FORMULA .

It is easy to see that (ZC) implies KC since it implies
that the set of orders of torsion units of FORMULA  is the
same the set of orders of elements of FORMULA .
In the same paper W. Kimmerle verified that (KC) holds for
finite Frobenius and solvable groups.
We remark that with respect to the
so-called FORMULA -version of the Zassenhaus conjecture the investigation
of Frobenius groups was completed by M. Hertweck and the first author
in {{cite:bd69df9a-244e-496f-b2b4-3c33ca7d2399}}.
In {{cite:d46d7a28-5973-4d85-a3c7-1d8b84a6b809}}, {{cite:ff40e2ea-a4d0-480b-b0bb-8098b823677a}}, {{cite:51e7a09a-0bad-4c63-8829-599e2e21acfa}}, {{cite:fbe7d68c-059d-44c4-9874-3eb9d5ee994e}}
(KC) was confirmed for the sporadic simple groups FORMULA ,
FORMULA , FORMULA  and some Janko simple groups.
Here we continue these investigations for the Mathieu simple group
FORMULA . Although we cannot prove the rational conjugacy of torsion
units of FORMULA  with elements of FORMULA , our main
result gives a lot of information on the orders and partial
augmentations of these units. In particular, we confirm Kimmerle's
conjecture for this group.
Let FORMULA . It is well known
(see {{cite:654c978b-446f-407b-b5ad-877e83064881}}, {{cite:656ddc63-4731-4ee0-8cb2-8aa1be25cb37}}) that
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA .
The group FORMULA  has 12 irreducible characters of the
following degrees:
1, 21, 45, 45, 55, 99, 154, 210,
231, 280, 280 and 385.
Let
FORMULA 
be the collection of all conjugacy classes of FORMULA , where the first
index denotes the order of the elements of this conjugacy class
and FORMULA . Suppose FORMULA 
has finite order FORMULA . Denote by
FORMULA  the partial augmentation of FORMULA  with respect to
FORMULA . From the Berman–Higman Theorem (see {{cite:e0feab63-68e7-420a-9bc0-3456914c9b97}} and {{cite:162ded68-e07b-4a2c-90a7-08346604ce8f}}, Ch.5, p.102) one knows that
FORMULA  and
FORMULA 
Hence, for any character FORMULA  of FORMULA , we get that FORMULA , where FORMULA  is a representative of the
conjugacy class FORMULA .
Our main result is the following
Theorem 1 
Let FORMULA  denote the Mathieu simple group FORMULA . Let FORMULA  be
a torsion unit of FORMULA  of order FORMULA . Denote by
FORMULA  the tuple
FORMULA 
of partial augmentations of FORMULA  in FORMULA .
The following properties hold.
(i)
There are no elements of order
10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 33, 35,
55 or 77 in FORMULA . Equivalently,
if FORMULA , then FORMULA  is the
order of some element FORMULA .
(ii)
If FORMULA , then FORMULA  is rationally conjugate to
some FORMULA .
(iii)
If FORMULA , then all components of FORMULA  are zero
except possibly FORMULA ,FORMULA  and FORMULA , and the triple
FORMULA  is one of
FORMULA 
(iv)
If FORMULA , then all components of FORMULA  are zero
except possibly FORMULA ,FORMULA  and FORMULA , and the triple
FORMULA  is one of
FORMULA 
(v)
If FORMULA , then all components of FORMULA  are zero
except possibly FORMULA  and FORMULA  and the pair FORMULA 
is one of
FORMULA 
(vi)
If FORMULA , then all components of FORMULA  are zero
except possibly FORMULA  and FORMULA  and the pair FORMULA 
is one of
FORMULA 


Note that using our implementation of the Luthar–Passi method,
which we intend to make available in the GAP package LAGUNA {{cite:433b0aa7-6d00-4283-b7dc-2eb4868b6351}},
we are able to compute the set of 76 tuples containing (likely as a proper
subset) possible tuples of partial augmentations for units of order 8,
listed in the Appendix 1. For the case of order 12 in the Appendix 2 we
listed 1166 tuples which can not be eliminated using the Luthar–Passi method.
As an immediate consequence of part (i) of the Theorem we obtain
Corollary 1 If FORMULA  then FORMULA .


Preliminaries
The following result allows a reformulation of
the Zassenhaus conjecture in terms of vanishing of
partial augmentations of torsion units.
Proposition 1 
(see {{cite:6cb1edc7-0c68-4c4d-8207-c9b923860893}} and
Theorem 2.5 in {{cite:057e8651-b81d-4237-9ccc-d76b4eeabc64}})
Let FORMULA 
be of order FORMULA . Then FORMULA  is conjugate in FORMULA  to an element FORMULA  if and only if for
each FORMULA  dividing FORMULA  there is precisely one
conjugacy class FORMULA  with partial augmentation
FORMULA .

The next results now serve to restrict the possible values of the partial augmentations
of torsion units.
Proposition 2 
(see {{cite:8f21ec9c-925b-42cb-8403-0dc20f2b3cd7}}, Proposition 3.1;
{{cite:24aae0c8-355e-4324-b5d7-0a404f649117}}, Proposition 2.2)
Let FORMULA  be a finite
group and let FORMULA  be a torsion unit in FORMULA . If FORMULA  is an element of FORMULA  whose FORMULA -part,
for some prime FORMULA , has order strictly greater
than the order of the FORMULA -part of FORMULA , then
FORMULA .

The next result is explained in detail in {{cite:6cb1edc7-0c68-4c4d-8207-c9b923860893}} and
{{cite:bd69df9a-244e-496f-b2b4-3c33ca7d2399}}, {{cite:24aae0c8-355e-4324-b5d7-0a404f649117}}.
Proposition 3 
(see {{cite:24aae0c8-355e-4324-b5d7-0a404f649117}}, {{cite:6cb1edc7-0c68-4c4d-8207-c9b923860893}}) Let either FORMULA  or FORMULA  a prime
divisor of FORMULA . Suppose
that FORMULA  has finite order FORMULA  and assume FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are coprime in case FORMULA . If FORMULA  is a complex primitive FORMULA -th root
of unity and FORMULA  is either a classical character or a FORMULA -Brauer
character of FORMULA , then for every integer FORMULA  the number
FORMULA 
is a non-negative integer.

Note that if FORMULA , we will use the notation FORMULA 
for FORMULA .
Finally, we shall use the well-known bound for
orders of torsion units.
Proposition 4  (see {{cite:b69c31ce-7541-4dd5-893e-d0c81f26ca46}})
The order of a torsion element FORMULA 
is a divisor of the exponent of FORMULA .

In case of units of prime power order, the following Proposition
may also be useful to eliminate some tuples of partial augmentations.
Proposition 5  (see {{cite:b69c31ce-7541-4dd5-893e-d0c81f26ca46}})
Let FORMULA  be a prime, and let FORMULA  be a torsion unit of FORMULA  of order FORMULA .
Then for FORMULA  the sum of all partial augmentations of FORMULA  with respect to
conjugacy classes of elements of order FORMULA  is divisible by FORMULA .


Proof of the Theorem
Throughout this section we denote FORMULA  by FORMULA .
The ordinary and FORMULA -Brauer character tables of FORMULA , which will be denoted by
FORMULA  where FORMULA , can be found using
the computational algebra system GAP {{cite:654c978b-446f-407b-b5ad-877e83064881}}, which derives its
data from {{cite:f2957dd9-0c82-458d-92ee-32b404875311}}, {{cite:a2225d9d-b6ae-414b-9465-c3b99fcad2be}}. For the characters
and conjugacy classes we will use throughout the paper the same
notation, including indexation, as used in the GAP Character
Table Library.
Since the group FORMULA  possesses elements of
orders 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 11, we first
investigate units of all of these orders except 8.
After this, since by Proposition REF , the
order of each torsion unit divides the exponent of FORMULA , it
remains to consider units of orders 10, 12, 14, 15, 21,
22, 33, 35, 55 and 77. We prove that FORMULA 
contains no units of any of these
orders, except possibly for orders 12 and 24.
Now we consider each case separately.
FORMULA  Let FORMULA  be a unit of order 2, 3 or 5. Using
Proposition REF  we immediately obtain that all partial
augmentations except one are zero. Thus by Proposition REF  part
(ii) of Theorem REF  is proved.
FORMULA  Let FORMULA  be a unit of order 4.
By (REF ) and Proposition REF  we get
FORMULA . Now using Proposition REF 
we obtain the following system of inequalities:
FORMULA 
Put FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
then FORMULA  and
FORMULA . Thus, we obtain the system of linear equations
FORMULA 
Solving such systems for all possible combinations of values of FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
and considering additional inequalities
FORMULA 
and also restrictions given by Proposition REF , we get only
the 34 integer solutions FORMULA  listed in part (iii) of the Theorem REF .
FORMULA  Let FORMULA  be a unit of order 6.
By (REF ) and Proposition REF  we get
FORMULA . By Proposition REF 
we obtain the following system of inequalities:
FORMULA 
Using calculations similar to the previous case,
we get only the 15 integer solutions FORMULA  listed in part (iv)
of the Theorem REF .
FORMULA  Let FORMULA  be a unit of order 7.
By (REF ) and Proposition REF  we get
FORMULA . Using Proposition REF 
we obtain the following system of inequalities:
FORMULA 
Using that FORMULA , we get that FORMULA , and after this it is
easy to check that we have only the four integer solutions FORMULA  listed in part (v)
of the Theorem REF .
FORMULA  Let FORMULA  be a unit of order 11.
By (REF ) and Proposition REF  we get
FORMULA . Using Proposition REF 
we obtain the following system of inequalities:
FORMULA 
Using calculations similar to the previous case, we get
only the ten integer solutions for FORMULA  listed in part (vi)
of the Theorem REF .
It remains to prove part (i) of the Theorem REF ,
considering units of FORMULA  of orders
10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 33, 35, 55 and 77.
FORMULA  Let FORMULA  be a unit of order 10.
By (REF ) and Proposition REF  we get
FORMULA . Using Proposition REF 
we obtain the following system of inequalities:
FORMULA 
that has no solutions such that all FORMULA  are non-negative integers.
FORMULA  Let FORMULA  be a unit of order 14.
Then by (REF ) and Proposition REF  we get
FORMULA .
We need to consider four cases
defined by part (v) of Theorem REF , but in all of them
using Proposition REF  we obtain the same system of inequalities:
FORMULA 
which has no solutions such that all FORMULA  are non-negative integers.
FORMULA  Let FORMULA  be a unit of order 15.
By (REF ) and Proposition REF  we get
FORMULA . Using Proposition REF 
we obtain the following system of inequalities:
FORMULA 
From this follows that FORMULA ,
and all conditions together leave us no integer solutions.
FORMULA  Let FORMULA  be a unit of order 21. Then
by (REF ) and Proposition REF  we have
FORMULA 
We need to consider four cases determined by part (v) of Theorem REF .
Using Proposition REF  we obtain the following systems of inequalities:
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
which have no solutions such that all FORMULA  are non-negative integers.
FORMULA  Let FORMULA  be a unit of order 22.
Then by (REF ) and Proposition REF  we get
FORMULA 
We need to consider ten cases determined by part (vi) of the Theorem REF .
In each case using Proposition REF  we obtain the following system of inequalities:
FORMULA 
that has no solutions such that all FORMULA  are non-negative integers.
FORMULA  Let FORMULA  be a unit of order 33.
Then by (REF ) and Proposition REF  we get
FORMULA 
As in the previous case, we need to consider ten cases determined by part (vi) of the Theorem REF .
In each case using Proposition REF  we obtain the same system:
FORMULA 
that has no solutions such that all FORMULA  are non-negative integers.
FORMULA  Let FORMULA  be a unit of order 35.
Then by (REF ) and Proposition REF  we get
FORMULA .
We need to consider four cases
defined by part (v) of the Theorem REF , but in all of them
using Proposition REF  we obtain the same system of inequalities:
FORMULA 
which has no solutions such that all FORMULA  are non-negative integers.
FORMULA  Let FORMULA  be a unit of order 55.
Then by (REF ) and Proposition REF  we get
FORMULA 
We need to consider ten cases determined by part (vi) of the Theorem REF .
In each case using Proposition REF  we obtain the following system of inequalities:
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
that has no solutions such that all FORMULA  are non-negative integers.
FORMULA  Let FORMULA  be a unit of order 77.
Then by (REF ) and Proposition REF  we have
FORMULA 
We must consider 40 cases determined by parts (v) and (vi) of the Theorem REF ,
but luckily in all of them using Proposition REF  we obtain the same system of inequalities:
FORMULA 
which has no solutions such that all FORMULA  are non-negative integers.
This finishes the proof of Theorem REF .
