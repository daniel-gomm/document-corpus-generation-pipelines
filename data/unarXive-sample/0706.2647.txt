The box distance function
Definition 1.1 Let FORMULA  and FORMULA  be a measure
space with FORMULA . For two maps FORMULA , we define a number FORMULA 
as the infimum of FORMULA  such that there exists a
measurable subset FORMULA  of measure
at least FORMULA  satisfying
FORMULA  for any FORMULA .

It is easy to see that this is a distance function on the set of all
functions on FORMULA , and the two distance functions FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are equivalent to each other for any
FORMULA .
An mm-space is a triple FORMULA , where FORMULA  is a complete separable
metric on a set FORMULA  and FORMULA  a finite Borel measure on FORMULA . Two mm-spaces are isomorphic to each other if
there is a measure preserving isometry between the supports of their
measures. We denote by FORMULA  the Lebesgue measure on FORMULA .
Definition 1.2 (parameter) Let FORMULA  be an mm-space and
FORMULA . Then, there exists a Borel measurable map
FORMULA  with FORMULA , where
FORMULA  stands for the push-forward
measure of FORMULA  by FORMULA . We call FORMULA  a
parameter of FORMULA .

Note that if the support of FORMULA  is not a one-point, then its
parameter is not unique.
Definition 1.3 (Gromov's box distance function) If two mm-spaces FORMULA  satisfy FORMULA , we define
FORMULA 
where the infimum is taken over all parameters
FORMULA , and
FORMULA  is defined by FORMULA  for FORMULA .
If FORMULA , putting FORMULA 
, we define
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .

We denote by FORMULA  the space of all isomorphic class
of mm-spaces. FORMULA  is a distance function on FORMULA  for any FORMULA  (See Theorem REF ). Note that the distances FORMULA  and FORMULA  are
equivalent to each other for distinct FORMULA .
The following two lemmas are easy to prove, so we omit the proof.
Lemma 1.4 Assume that two mm-spaces FORMULA  satisfy FORMULA  and a Borel measurable map FORMULA  satisfies
FORMULA . Then, both FORMULA 
and FORMULA  are parameters, and the inequality
FORMULA 
holds.

Lemma 1.5 Assume that two mm-spaces FORMULA  satisfy FORMULA  and let FORMULA . Then, we have
FORMULA 

The following lemma is the key to prove the triangle inequality for FORMULA .
Lemma 1.6 Let FORMULA  be a mm-space and FORMULA  be two parameters. Then, for any FORMULA ,
there exist two Borel measurable maps FORMULA  such that FORMULA , and
FORMULA 
To prove the lemma, we shall approximate FORMULA  by a
countable space. For any FORMULA , there exists a sequence FORMULA  of pairwise disjoint Borel subsets of FORMULA  such that
FORMULA  and FORMULA  for each FORMULA . Fix a point FORMULA 
for each
FORMULA . We define
a distance between FORMULA  and FORMULA  by FORMULA , and a Borel measure FORMULA  on FORMULA  by FORMULA .
Define two maps FORMULA  and FORMULA  by FORMULA  for FORMULA  and FORMULA  for FORMULA . It is easy to see that FORMULA  and
FORMULA . Put FORMULA  for FORMULA , and FORMULA  for FORMULA , FORMULA .
We construct a Borel measurable map FORMULA  as follows: There is a sequence FORMULA  of compact subsets of FORMULA  such that
FORMULA  and FORMULA . Take a Borel measurable map FORMULA  such that
FORMULA . For each
FORMULA , we find a sequence FORMULA  of pairwise disjoint open intervals such that
FORMULA . Take Borel measurable
maps FORMULA  and FORMULA , FORMULA , such that FORMULA 
for FORMULA . By modifying each FORMULA , we may assume
that FORMULA .
Then we define a Borel measurable map FORMULA  by FORMULA  if FORMULA . Put FORMULA  for FORMULA  and FORMULA  for FORMULA . It is obvious that this map FORMULA  satisfies
FORMULA . In this way,
we find a sequence of Borel measurable maps FORMULA  such that FORMULA  for each FORMULA .
Define a Borel measurable map FORMULA  by FORMULA  for FORMULA  and FORMULA  for FORMULA . From the above construction, it follows that FORMULA  and FORMULA . In the same way, we find a Borel
measurable map FORMULA  such that FORMULA  and FORMULA . Therefore, by using Lemma REF , we have
FORMULA 
This completes the proof.

Lemma 1.7 For any FORMULA , FORMULA  satisfies the triangle inequality.
Let FORMULA  be mm-spaces and
put FORMULA .
Case 1 FORMULA .

Let FORMULA  be any parameters. By virtue of Lemma REF , for any FORMULA , there exists two Borel measurable maps FORMULA 
such that FORMULA , and
FORMULA 
Applying Lemma REF , we get
FORMULA 
which shows FORMULA .
Case 2 FORMULA .

If FORMULA , by Lemma
REF , we have
FORMULA 
If FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
Case 3 FORMULA .

If FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
If FORMULA , applying Lemma REF , we get
FORMULA 

FORMULA  directly implies that
FORMULA 
Thus, we obtain FORMULA .
Case 4 FORMULA .

If FORMULA , by using Lemma REF , we have
FORMULA 
If FORMULA , by Lemma REF , we get
FORMULA 
We prove the same way for the case of FORMULA . This completes the proof of Lemma REF .

Let FORMULA  be a mm-space and FORMULA  be the set of all real FORMULA  matrices. Then we define a Borel measurable map
FORMULA  by FORMULA , and a Borel measure on FORMULA  by
FORMULA .
Theorem 1.8 (mm-Reconstruction theorem, {{cite:d788b5a0-db63-4a06-8558-c12183c02f66}}) If two
mm-spaces FORMULA  have FORMULA  for all FORMULA ,
then FORMULA  and FORMULA  are isomorphic to each other.

A. M. Vershik gave the another proof of the reconstruction thereom in
{{cite:45e2f4b5-559d-47f1-8d01-308d97a4ee17}}. We also refer to {{cite:bc1d4b34-6379-4800-8841-3c3131a1cd53}} for his proof. In {{cite:bc1d4b34-6379-4800-8841-3c3131a1cd53}}, T. Kondo generalized
the reconstruction theorem to the space of Borel probability measures
on FORMULA .
Lemma 1.9 Let FORMULA  be a mm-space, and FORMULA  be a parameter of FORMULA . We set FORMULA . Then, we have FORMULA  for all FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be a Borel measurable map defined by FORMULA . Obviously, FORMULA . Therefore, for
any Borel subset FORMULA , we obtain
FORMULA 
This completes the proof.

Theorem 1.10 (Gromov, cf. {{cite:d788b5a0-db63-4a06-8558-c12183c02f66}}) For any FORMULA , FORMULA  is a distance
fuction on FORMULA .
Since FORMULA  satisfies the triangle
inequality, we only prove that FORMULA 
implies FORMULA . Supposing that FORMULA ,
we shall show FORMULA  for any FORMULA . Then, by Theorem REF , we get FORMULA .
Since FORMULA , there exist a sequence FORMULA  of parameters of FORMULA 
and a sequence FORMULA 
of parameters of FORMULA  such that FORMULA  as FORMULA . Hence, there exist
a sequence FORMULA  of
positive numbers and a sequence FORMULA  of Borel subsets of FORMULA  such
that FORMULA  as FORMULA ,
FORMULA , and
FORMULA  for any FORMULA . Let FORMULA  be an
arbitrary open set and denote by FORMULA  the
usual Euclidean distance on FORMULA , that is,
FORMULA 

Put
FORMULA 

We take FORMULA  such that
FORMULA  for any FORMULA .
Claim 1.11 For any FORMULA , we
have FORMULA .
Take any FORMULA . If FORMULA , then for any FORMULA  we have
FORMULA 
which implies that
FORMULA . Hence, we obtain
FORMULA . This completes the proof of the claim.

Put
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
and let FORMULA .
Combining Lemma REF  and Claim REF , for any FORMULA  we have
FORMULA 

In the above inequality, let first FORMULA  and next FORMULA . Then we get FORMULA . The same argument shows that
FORMULA , which yields FORMULA . This completes the proof of Theorem REF .


The observable distance function
For a measure space FORMULA  with FORMULA , we denote by
FORMULA  the space of all functions on FORMULA . Given
FORMULA  and FORMULA , we put
FORMULA 
Note that this FORMULA  is a distance function on FORMULA  for any FORMULA  and its topology on
FORMULA  coincides with the topology of the
convergence in measure for any FORMULA . Also, the distance functions
FORMULA  for all FORMULA  are mutually equivalent.
We recall that the Hausdorff distance between two closed
subsets FORMULA  and FORMULA  in a metric space FORMULA  is defined by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is a closed FORMULA -neighborhood of FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be a measure space with FORMULA . For a
semi-distance function FORMULA  on FORMULA , we indicate by FORMULA  the space of
all 1-Lipschitz functions on FORMULA  with respect to FORMULA . Note that
FORMULA  is a closed subset in
FORMULA  for any FORMULA .
Definition 2.1 For FORMULA  and two semi-distance functions FORMULA  on FORMULA , we define
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  stands for the Hausdorff distance
function in  FORMULA

This FORMULA  is actually a distance function on the space of all
semi-distance functions on
FORMULA  for all FORMULA , and the two distance functions FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are equivalent to each other for any
FORMULA .
Lemma 2.2 For any two semi-distance functions FORMULA  on FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
For any FORMULA  with FORMULA , there exists a measurable subset FORMULA  such that FORMULA  and FORMULA  for any
FORMULA . Given arbitrary FORMULA , we
define FORMULA  by FORMULA . We see
easily that FORMULA  and FORMULA  for any FORMULA . Taking any FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
Therefore, we get FORMULA , which implies FORMULA . Similary, we also have
FORMULA , which yields FORMULA . This completes the proof.

Definition 2.3 (Observable distance function) If two mm-spaces FORMULA  satisfy FORMULA , we define
FORMULA 
where the infimum is taken over all parameters
FORMULA . If FORMULA , putting FORMULA , we define
FORMULA 

FORMULA  is a distance function on FORMULA  for any FORMULA 
(See Theorem REF ).
Note that the distance functions FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are equivalent to each
other for any FORMULA .
The proofs of following four lemmas are easy.
Lemma 2.4 For any parameter FORMULA  of FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 

Lemma 2.5 Assume that two mm-spaces FORMULA  satisfy FORMULA  and a Borel measurable map
FORMULA  satisfies FORMULA . Then, we have
FORMULA 

Lemma 2.6 Assume that two mm-spaces FORMULA  satisfy FORMULA  and let FORMULA . Then, we have
FORMULA 

Lemma 2.7 Let X be a mm-space and FORMULA  be two parameters. Then, for any FORMULA , there
exist two Borel measurable maps FORMULA  such that FORMULA , FORMULA , and
FORMULA 

Theorem 2.8 (Gromov, cf. {{cite:d788b5a0-db63-4a06-8558-c12183c02f66}}) For any FORMULA , FORMULA  is a distance function on
FORMULA .
Combining Lemma REF , REF , and
REF , we see that FORMULA  satisfies the triangle inequality
in the same way of the proof of Lemma REF .
To prove “FORMULA ”, we shall approximate
each FORMULA  and FORMULA  by finite spaces. Take an arbitrary FORMULA . Then, there exists sequences FORMULA , FORMULA  of pairwise disjoint Borel subsets of FORMULA , FORMULA  such that
 FORMULA
FORMULA  and FORMULA  for any FORMULA ,
 FORMULA
FORMULA  and FORMULA  for any FORMULA .

Put FORMULA . Then, there exists FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
Since FORMULA , there exist a sequence FORMULA  of positive numbers and sequences FORMULA , FORMULA  of parameters of FORMULA , FORMULA  such that
FORMULA  and FORMULA  as FORMULA . For each FORMULA , we fix
points FORMULA  and FORMULA . Define a function
FORMULA  by
FORMULA  for each FORMULA . From Lemma REF , we have
FORMULA . Hence, there
exists FORMULA  such that FORMULA . Putting
FORMULA 
we get FORMULA . For
each FORMULA , we define a function
FORMULA  by
FORMULA . By the same
argument as above, there exists FORMULA  such that FORMULA , where
FORMULA 

So, putting
FORMULA 
we obtain FORMULA .
For any FORMULA , there exist FORMULA  such
that
FORMULA 
Since FORMULA  and FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
We also get FORMULA  by FORMULA . Therefore,
we obtain
FORMULA 
Since FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
we have FORMULA  and FORMULA , and thus FORMULA . Therefore, we obtain
FORMULA 
A similar argument shows that
FORMULA 
Hence, we get
FORMULA 
Therefore, we obtain
FORMULA 
So, we get FORMULA  and FORMULA . This
completes the proof.

Modifying the proof of Theorem REF , we get the following
corollary:
Corollary 2.9 For any two mm-spaces FORMULA  and FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 

We also refer to {{cite:af94f150-ac1b-4f79-8e39-4fa52f03ed66}}.

Another natural method
Let FORMULA  and FORMULA . A map from an mm-space to a metric space, say
FORMULA  is called FORMULA -Lipschitz up to  FORMULA if
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA  in a Borel subset FORMULA  with
FORMULA .
Proposition 3.1 (cf. {{cite:d788b5a0-db63-4a06-8558-c12183c02f66}}) Let FORMULA , FORMULA  be mm-spaces
and FORMULA . Let FORMULA  and FORMULA 
a FORMULA -Lipschitz up to FORMULA  Borel merasurable map and
assume that FORMULA  as FORMULA  and the sequence FORMULA  converges weakly to
FORMULA . Then, the sequence FORMULA  has a
FORMULA -convergent subsequence.
Without loss of generality, we may assume that FORMULA  and FORMULA .
By choosing a subsequence, we have
FORMULA . From the
assumption, there exists a Borel subset FORMULA  such that
FORMULA  and FORMULA  for any
FORMULA . Put FORMULA . Since
FORMULA 
we have FORMULA . Take a countable dense subset FORMULA .
Claim 3.2 The sequence FORMULA  has a
convergent subsequence.
The proof is by contradiction. If the sequence FORMULA  has no convergent subsequence, then the
subset FORMULA  is a closed subset in
FORMULA , especially, FORMULA  is
complete. From the assumption, this set FORMULA  is not
compact. Hence, FORMULA  is not totally bounded, that is, there exists
FORMULA  such that FORMULA  has no finite 2FORMULA -net. Therefore, by
choosing a subsequence, we get FORMULA  for any FORMULA  with FORMULA . Take
FORMULA  such that FORMULA  and FORMULA  for any FORMULA . Since
FORMULA 
and FORMULA 
converges weakly to FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
for any FORMULA . For any FORMULA , there exists
FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
Take FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
for any FORMULA . Hence, for any FORMULA  we
have
FORMULA 
which implies that
FORMULA 
 Fix
FORMULA  with FORMULA . Since FORMULA , we get FORMULA  for any FORMULA  and for any suffieciently large FORMULA . Therefore, we
get
FORMULA 
for any suffieciently large FORMULA . Hence, we
obtain
FORMULA 
which yields FORMULA . This is a contradition, since FORMULA . This completes the proof of the claim.

By virtue of Claim REF  and the diagonal argument, we have
that FORMULA  is convergent sequence in FORMULA 
for each FORMULA . We put FORMULA  for any FORMULA . Extend the map FORMULA  to FORMULA , by using FORMULA  is a
FORMULA -Lipschitz map.
Claim 3.3 
For any FORMULA , we have FORMULA  as FORMULA .
Since FORMULA , for any
FORMULA  there exists FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
From the definition, there exists FORMULA 
such that FORMULA  for any FORMULA  and FORMULA . Take any FORMULA . There exists FORMULA  such that FORMULA . Hence, for any FORMULA  we have
FORMULA 
Therefore, for any suffieciently large FORMULA , we obtain
FORMULA 
This completes the proof of the claim.

According to Claim REF , we have
FORMULA  as FORMULA . This completes the
proof of the proposition.

Gromov proved in {{cite:d788b5a0-db63-4a06-8558-c12183c02f66}} the following
proposition by using the distance function FORMULA  on the space
of finite Borel measures. Although the distance function
FORMULA  does not appare in the proof of the following
proposition, the proof is essentially the same spirit of his proof.
Proposition 3.4 (cf. {{cite:d788b5a0-db63-4a06-8558-c12183c02f66}}) Let FORMULA  be a sequence of Borel
measures on a metric space FORMULA  and assume that FORMULA  converges weakly to a Borel measure FORMULA . Then, we
have
FORMULA 
Without loss of generality, we may assume that FORMULA 
and FORMULA  for any FORMULA . For any FORMULA ,
there exists a sequence FORMULA  of pairwise
disjoint Borel
subsets of FORMULA  satisfying the following properties FORMULA .
 FORMULA
FORMULA .
 FORMULA
For any FORMULA , FORMULA .
 FORMULA
For any FORMULA , FORMULA .

From FORMULA  and FORMULA , there exists FORMULA  such that
FORMULA . From the
assumption, FORMULA  as FORMULA  for any FORMULA . Hence, putting
FORMULA 

there exists FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
for any FORMULA  and FORMULA . Fix a parameter FORMULA  of the mm-space FORMULA  for each FORMULA .
For any FORMULA , we indicate by FORMULA  its interior. Since
FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
Take a paramter FORMULA  of the
mm-space FORMULA . Defining a Borel measurable map FORMULA  by
FORMULA 
we see that the map FORMULA  is a parameter of
FORMULA . We take any FORMULA . Take parameters FORMULA  of FORMULA , of the mm-spaces
FORMULA , and a parameter FORMULA  of the mm-space FORMULA . We define a Borel measurable map FORMULA  by
FORMULA 

The map FORMULA  is a parameter of the mm-space FORMULA 
for each FORMULA . Putting FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
For any FORMULA , there exist FORMULA  such
that FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA . Since FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
Therefore, we obtain
FORMULA . This completes the proof.

Theorem 3.5 (Gromov, cf. {{cite:d788b5a0-db63-4a06-8558-c12183c02f66}}) FORMULA  as FORMULA  if and only if
for any FORMULA  there exist a Borel measurable map FORMULA , a Borel subset FORMULA , and a
positive number FORMULA  satisfying the
following conditions FORMULA .
 FORMULA
FORMULA  as FORMULA .
 FORMULA
FORMULA  for
FORMULA .
 FORMULA
FORMULA  for any FORMULA .
 FORMULA
The sequence FORMULA  converges weakly to
FORMULA .

Assume that FORMULA  holds. By virtue of Proposition
REF , we have FORMULA  as FORMULA .
Assume that FORMULA  as FORMULA . Without loss of
generality, we may assume that FORMULA  for any
FORMULA . From the assumption, there exist parameters
FORMULA  of FORMULA  and FORMULA  of FORMULA ,
FORMULA , such that FORMULA  as FORMULA . Hence, for each
FORMULA , there exist FORMULA  and compact subset FORMULA  satisfying the following conditions FORMULA :
 FORMULA
FORMULA  as FORMULA .
 FORMULA
FORMULA .
 FORMULA
For any FORMULA ,
FORMULA .
 FORMULA
The maps FORMULA  and FORMULA  are continuous.

By FORMULA , each set FORMULA  is compact. For each
FORMULA , there exist FORMULA  and a sequence FORMULA  of pairwise disijoint Borel subsets of FORMULA  such that
FORMULA  for any FORMULA  and
FORMULA . For each
FORMULA , we fix a point FORMULA . Then there exist a point
FORMULA  with FORMULA . Put
FORMULA .
Claim 3.6 FORMULA .
Take any FORMULA  with FORMULA . Since FORMULA , there exists FORMULA  such that
FORMULA . Hence, by FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
This completes the proof of the claim.

We denote by
FORMULA 
the mutually different elements of FORMULA . Put
FORMULA 

It is easy to see that FORMULA , FORMULA  for FORMULA , and FORMULA . Take points FORMULA  for any FORMULA  and FORMULA . We define a Borel measurable map
FORMULA  by FORMULA  if FORMULA  and
FORMULA  if FORMULA . For each
FORMULA , we fix FORMULA  with FORMULA  and
put FORMULA .
Claim 3.7 The sequence FORMULA 
converges weaky to the measure FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be any bounded
uniformly continuous function and put FORMULA . We shall prove
FORMULA 
Since
FORMULA 
we get
FORMULA 
Similary, we have
FORMULA 
Since for any  FORMULA
FORMULA 
we obtain
FORMULA 
Since FORMULA  is uniformly continuous function on FORMULA , for any
FORMULA  there exists FORMULA  such that
FORMULA  for any
FORMULA  with FORMULA . Hence for any FORMULA  with FORMULA , we have
FORMULA , which implies that
FORMULA 

Therefore, we obtain
FORMULA 
This completes the proof of the claim.

For any FORMULA , we obtain
FORMULA 
Therefore, we have complete the proof of Theorem REF .

Modifying the proof of Theorem REF , we get the following
corollary:
Corollary 3.8 Let FORMULA  and FORMULA , FORMULA , be compact mm-spaces. Assume that
FORMULA , FORMULA , and
FORMULA  for any FORMULA .
Then, the sequence FORMULA  converges to FORMULA  with
respect to FORMULA  if and only if FORMULA  converges to FORMULA  in the sense of the measured
Gromov-Hausdorff convergence.

Combining Proposition REF  and Theorem REF , we get
the following corollary:
Corollary 3.9 Assume that FORMULA . Then, two mm-spaces FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are isomorphic to each other.


Stability of homogenuity
We say that an mm-space FORMULA  Lipschitz dominates an mm-space FORMULA 
and write FORMULA  if
there exist 1-Lipschitz map FORMULA  and FORMULA  such that FORMULA .
Theorem 4.1 (Gromov, cf. {{cite:d788b5a0-db63-4a06-8558-c12183c02f66}}) Assume that FORMULA , FORMULA  as
FORMULA  and FORMULA  for any FORMULA . Then we
have FORMULA .
Without loss of generality, we may assume that
FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA  for any FORMULA . From the assumption, for any FORMULA  there exists
a 1-Lipschitz map FORMULA  such that
FORMULA . By using Theorem REF , for
any FORMULA 
there exists a Borel measurable map FORMULA , a compact subset
FORMULA , and FORMULA  such that
 FORMULA
FORMULA  as FORMULA ,
 FORMULA
FORMULA  for
FORMULA ,
 FORMULA
FORMULA  for any FORMULA ,
 FORMULA
The sequence FORMULA  converges weakly to
FORMULA .

From now on, we define a Borel measurable map FORMULA  as follows: Since FORMULA  as FORMULA , there
exists a parameter FORMULA  and FORMULA  such that FORMULA  as FORMULA . Hence, there exists a
compact subset FORMULA  and FORMULA  satisfying
the following properties FORMULA :
 FORMULA
FORMULA  as FORMULA .
 FORMULA
FORMULA .
 FORMULA
For any FORMULA ,
FORMULA .
 FORMULA
The maps FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are continuous.

By FORMULA , the sets FORMULA  and FORMULA  are compact. For each
FORMULA , there exist FORMULA  and a sequence FORMULA  of pairwise disijoint Borel subsets of FORMULA  such that
FORMULA  for any FORMULA  and
FORMULA . For each
FORMULA , we fix a point FORMULA . Then there exist a point
FORMULA  with FORMULA . Put FORMULA . Then, we get FORMULA . We denote by
FORMULA 
the mutually different elements of FORMULA . Put
FORMULA 

It is easy to see that FORMULA , FORMULA  for FORMULA , and FORMULA . Take points FORMULA  for any FORMULA  and FORMULA . We put FORMULA  if FORMULA  and
FORMULA  if FORMULA . The same proof in Theorem REF  implies the following: There
exists a positive number FORMULA  such that FORMULA  as
FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA  for any FORMULA .
Put FORMULA . For any FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
Hence, FORMULA  is a 1-Lipschitz up to FORMULA  Borel measurable map.
Claim 4.2 The sequence FORMULA  converges weakly to the measure FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be any bounded uniformly continuous function on
FORMULA . We will prove that
FORMULA 
Since
FORMULA 
it suffices to prove that
FORMULA 
Put FORMULA . Take any
FORMULA . We have
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
for any suffieciently large FORMULA . For any FORMULA , we put
FORMULA 
Let FORMULA  with FORMULA . For any FORMULA , we get
FORMULA  for suffieciently large
FORMULA  by the same method of the proof in Theorem
REF . Assume that FORMULA  and
FORMULA . Then, for any suffieciently large
FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
Hence, we get
FORMULA 

This completes the proof of the claim.

Combining Proposition REF  and Claim REF , we may
assume that the sequence FORMULA  converges with
respect to the distance function FORMULA . Let FORMULA  be its
limit. Then this FORMULA  is obviously a 1-Lipschitz map.
Claim 4.3 The sequence FORMULA  converges weakly to the measure FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be any open subset. Put FORMULA  for any
FORMULA . For any FORMULA , there exists FORMULA  such
that FORMULA . Therefore, we obtain
FORMULA 
This completes the proof of the claim.

Combining Claim REF  and Claim REF ,
we get FORMULA . This completes the proof of the theorem.

Modifying the proof of Theorem REF , we get the following corollary:
Corollary 4.4 Assume that a sequence FORMULA  of
compact homogeneous Riemannian manifolds convergence to an mm-space FORMULA 
with respect to the distance function FORMULA  and FORMULA . Then, the limit space FORMULA  is also homogeneous and every
isometry FORMULA  satisfy FORMULA .
