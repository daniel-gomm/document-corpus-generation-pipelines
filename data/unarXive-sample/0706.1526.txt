Introduction
The square of a graph FORMULA  is the graph FORMULA  on the same vertex set
with edges between pair of vertices of distance one or two in FORMULA .
Coloring squares of graphs has been studied, e.g., in relation to frequency
allocation. This models the case when nodes represent both senders and
receivers, and two senders with a common neighbor will interfere if
using the same frequency.
The problem of coloring squares of graphs has particularly seen much
attention on planar graphs.
A conjecture of Wegner {{cite:c48051af-5fb2-474a-bc8d-40d97505e714}} dating from 1977 (see
{{cite:c9c75145-ce00-496f-980d-db1fc3e00a10}}), states that the square of every planar graph FORMULA  of
maximum degree FORMULA  has a chromatic number which does not
exceed FORMULA . The conjecture matches the maximum clique
number of these graphs. Currently the best upper bound known is
FORMULA  by Molloy and Salavatipour {{cite:82a5c3e9-66b1-4e3c-9f6f-3c45e6cca194}}.
An earlier paper of the current authors {{cite:f6757b89-e12c-47ea-be8f-2ff189df960f}} gave a bound
of FORMULA  for the chromatic number of squares of
planar graph with large maximum degree FORMULA . This is based
on bounding the inductiveness of the graph, which is the maximum
over all subgraphs FORMULA  of the minimum degree of FORMULA . It was also shown
there that this was the best possible bound on the inductiveness. Borodin et
al {{cite:1882f809-04d1-4b87-8c8f-fd37677e2919}} showed that this bound holds for all FORMULA .
Inductiveness has the additional advantage of also bounding the
list-chromatic number.
Inductiveness leads to a natural greedy algorithm (henceforth called Greedy):
Select vertex FORMULA  of minimum degree, sometimes called
a simplicial vertex of FORMULA , recursively color FORMULA ,
and finally color FORMULA  with the smallest available color.
Alternatively, FORMULA -inductiveness leads to an inductive ordering
FORMULA  of the vertices such that any vertex FORMULA  has at most FORMULA 
neighbors among FORMULA . Then, if we color the
vertices first-fit in the
reverse order FORMULA  (i.e. assigning each vertex
the smallest color not used among its previously colored neighbors),
the number of colors used is at most FORMULA . Implemented efficiently,
the algorithm runs in time linear in the size of the graph {{cite:d3d4b534-b031-4dae-909e-25bbdf60f2d8}}.
The algorithm has also the special advantage
that it requires only the square graph
FORMULA  and does not require information about the underlying graph FORMULA .
The purpose of this article is to further contribute to the study of
various vertex colorings of squares of planar graphs, by examining an
important subclass of them, the class of outerplanar graphs.
Observe that the neighborhood of a vertex with FORMULA  neighbors induces
a clique in the square graph. Thus, the chromatic number, and in fact
the clique number, of any graph of maximum degree FORMULA  is
necessarily a function of FORMULA  and always at least FORMULA .
Our results.
We derive tight bounds on chromatic number, as well as the
inductiveness and the clique number of the square of an outerplanar graph
FORMULA  as a function of the maximum degree FORMULA  of FORMULA .
One of the main results, given in Section , is that when FORMULA , the
inductiveness of FORMULA  is exactly FORMULA . It follows that the clique
and chromatic numbers are exactly FORMULA  and that Greedy yields
an optimal coloring. As a bonus we obtain in this case that the
choosability (see Definition REF ) is
the optimal FORMULA . We can then treat the low-degree cases
separately to derive a linear-time algorithm independent of FORMULA .
We examine in detail the low-degree cases, FORMULA , and
derive best possible upper bounds on the maximum clique and chromatic numbers,
as well as inductiveness of squares of outerplanar graphs.
These bounds are illustrated in Table REF .
We treat the special case of chordal outerplanar graphs separately,
and further classify all chordal outerplanar graphs FORMULA  for
which the inductiveness of FORMULA  exceeds FORMULA  or the clique or
chromatic number of FORMULA  exceed FORMULA .

Related results.
It is straightforward to show that the inductiveness of a square graph
of an outerplanar graph of degree FORMULA  is at most FORMULA  (see
{{cite:f6757b89-e12c-47ea-be8f-2ff189df960f}}), and this is attained by an inductive ordering of FORMULA .
Calamoneri and Petreschi {{cite:c037dda9-45ed-44a0-8963-9c9d7051facc}} gave a linear time
algorithm to distance-2 color outerplanar graphs, as well as for
related problems.
They showed that it uses an optimal FORMULA  colors whenever FORMULA , and at most FORMULA  colors for FORMULA .
In comparison, we give tight upper and lower bounds for all values of
FORMULA , give a thorough treatment of the subclass of chordal graphs,
and analyze a generic parameter, inductiveness, that gives as a bonus similar bounds
for the list chromatic number.
Zhou, Kanari and Nishizeki {{cite:51f96823-7e7b-4e14-aa9a-f0d85a271f31}} gave a polynomial time
algorithm to find an optimal coloring of any power of a partial
FORMULA -tree FORMULA , given FORMULA . Since outerplanar graphs are partial 2-trees,
this solves the coloring problem we consider. For squares of
outerplanar graphs, their algorithm has complexity
FORMULA ,
which is impractical for any values of FORMULA  and FORMULA .
When FORMULA  is constant, one can use the observation of
Krumke, Marathe and Ravi {{cite:6b80829b-c33c-4ec3-babe-dbbaf2701f70}} that squares of outerplanar
graphs have treewidth at most FORMULA .
Thus, one can use efficient (FORMULA  time) algorithms for coloring
partial FORMULA -trees, obtaining a linear-time algorithm when FORMULA  is constant.

Organization.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows:
In Section  we introduce our notation and definitions, and
show how the problems regarding the clique number and chromatic number
reduce to the case of biconnected outerplanar graphs.
Inductiveness is treated in Section . We then
treat the chordal case in Section . Many examples
here show that the lower bounds derived in other sections
(i.e. Sections  and ) are
optimal. The clique number is derived in Section .
The last Section  derives optimal bounds on chromatic number
in each of the smaller cases of FORMULA . The main
result there is the optimal bound for the
chromatic number of FORMULA  in the hardest case when FORMULA .

Definitions
In this section we give some basic definitions and prove results that will
be used later for our results in the following sections.
Graph notation.
The set FORMULA  of natural numbers will be denoted
by FORMULA . Unless otherwise stated, a graph FORMULA  will always be
a simple graph FORMULA  where FORMULA  is the set of vertices
or nodes, and FORMULA  the set of edges of FORMULA . The edge between the vertices
FORMULA  and FORMULA  will be denoted by FORMULA  (here FORMULA  and FORMULA  will mean the
same undirected edge).
By coloring we will always mean vertex coloring.
We denote by FORMULA  the chromatic number of FORMULA  and
by FORMULA  the clique number of FORMULA .
The degree of a vertex FORMULA  in graph FORMULA  is denoted by FORMULA .
We let FORMULA  and FORMULA  denote
the minimum and maximum
degree of a vertex in FORMULA  respectively.
When there is no danger of ambiguity, we simply write FORMULA  instead of FORMULA .
We denote by FORMULA  the open neighborhood of FORMULA  in FORMULA , that is the set
of all neighbors of FORMULA  in FORMULA , and by FORMULA  the closed neighborhood
of FORMULA  in FORMULA , that additionally includes FORMULA .
The square graph FORMULA  of a graph FORMULA  is a graph on the same vertex set
as FORMULA  in which additionally to the edges of FORMULA ,
every two vertices with a common neighbor in FORMULA  are
also connected with an edge. Clearly this is the same as the graph
on FORMULA  in which each pair of vertices of distance 2 or less in FORMULA 
are connected by an edge in FORMULA .
By a FORMULA -vertex we will mean a vertex of degree at most 2 in FORMULA 
and distance-2 degree at most FORMULA .
`

Tree terminology.
The diameter of FORMULA  is the number of edges in the longest simple path in
FORMULA  and will be denoted by FORMULA .
For a tree FORMULA  with FORMULA  we can form the pruned tree
FORMULA  by removing all the leaves of FORMULA .
A center of FORMULA  is a vertex of distance
at most FORMULA  from all other vertices of FORMULA .
A center of FORMULA  is either unique or one of two unique adjacent vertices.
When FORMULA  is rooted at FORMULA , the FORMULA -th ancestor, if it exists,
of a vertex FORMULA  is the vertex on the unique path
from FORMULA  to FORMULA  of distance FORMULA  from FORMULA .
An ancestor of FORMULA  is a FORMULA -th ancestor of FORMULA  for some FORMULA .
Note that FORMULA  is viewed as an ancestor of itself.
The parent (grandparent) of a vertex is then the
1-st (2-nd) ancestor of the vertex. The sibling of a vertex is
another child of its parent, and a cousin is child of a sibling
of its parent.
The height of a rooted tree is
the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf.
The height of a vertex FORMULA  in a rooted tree FORMULA  is the height of the
rooted subtree of FORMULA  induced by all vertices with FORMULA  as an ancestor.
A tree is said to be full if it contains no degree-two vertices.
Note that in a rooted tree FORMULA , vertices of height zero are the leaves
(provided that the root is not a leaf). Vertices of height one are
the parents of leaves, that is, the leaves of the pruned
tree FORMULA  and so on. In general, for FORMULA  let FORMULA  be
given recursively by FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Clearly FORMULA 
is a strict inclusion. With this in mind we have an alternative
“root-free” description of the height of vertices in a tree.
Observation 2.1 
Let FORMULA  be a tree and FORMULA .
The vertices of height FORMULA  in FORMULA  are precisely the leaves
of FORMULA .


Inductiveness.
The inductiveness or the degeneracy of a graph FORMULA , denoted
by FORMULA , is the natural number defined by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  runs through all the induced subgraphs of FORMULA .
If FORMULA  then we say that FORMULA  is FORMULA -inductive.
In a graph FORMULA  of maximum degree at most FORMULA , note that for any FORMULA ,
the vertex set FORMULA  will induce a
clique in FORMULA , and hence FORMULA .
Since FORMULA , the upper bound of FORMULA  is
necessarily an increasing function FORMULA  of FORMULA .
In general, the inductiveness of a graph FORMULA  yields an ordering FORMULA  of the vertex set FORMULA  of FORMULA , such that each vertex FORMULA 
has at most FORMULA  neighbors among the previous vertices
FORMULA  that is to say FORMULA . This gives us an efficient way to color
every graph FORMULA  by at most FORMULA  colors in a greedy fashion.

Biconnectivity.
The blocks of a graph FORMULA  are the maximal biconnected subgraphs of FORMULA .
A cutvertex is a vertex shared by two or more blocks.
A leaf block is a block with only one cutvertex (or none, if the
graph is already biconnected).
We show here that we can assume, without loss of generality, that FORMULA 
is biconnected when considering the chromatic number or the clique number
of FORMULA : Let FORMULA  be a graph and FORMULA  the set of its biconnected blocks.
In the same way that FORMULA  and
FORMULA ,
we have the following.
Lemma 2.2 
For a graph FORMULA  with a maximum degree FORMULA  and
set FORMULA  of biconnected blocks we have
FORMULA 
Further, optimal FORMULA -colorings of the squares of all the blocks
FORMULA  can be modified to a FORMULA -coloring of FORMULA 
in a greedy fashion.

Proof. 
First note that a clique of FORMULA  with vertices contained in more
than one block of FORMULA  must contain the cutvertex of two blocks. Therefore
the clique must be induced by the closed neighborhood of this cutvertex,
and hence of size at most FORMULA . This proves the first
formula for FORMULA .
For the chromatic number of FORMULA , we proceed by induction on FORMULA .
The case FORMULA  is a tautology, so assume FORMULA  has FORMULA 
blocks and that the lemma is true for
FORMULA . Let FORMULA  be a leaf block and let
FORMULA ,
with FORMULA  as a cutvertex.
If FORMULA  is the maximum degree of FORMULA , then by induction hypothesis
FORMULA .
Assume we have a FORMULA -coloring of FORMULA  and a FORMULA -coloring of
FORMULA , the latter given by a map FORMULA .
Since FORMULA  is a cutvertex we have a partition FORMULA ,
where FORMULA  and FORMULA . In the given
coloring FORMULA  all the vertices in FORMULA  have received distinct colors,
since they all have FORMULA  as a common neighbor in FORMULA . Since
FORMULA  there is a permutation
FORMULA  of FORMULA  such that
FORMULA  yields a new FORMULA -coloring of FORMULA 
such that all vertices in
FORMULA  receive distinct colors (here FORMULA  is the inclusion map
of FORMULA  in
FORMULA .)
This together with the given
FORMULA -coloring of FORMULA  provides a vertex coloring of FORMULA 
using at most
FORMULA ,
which completes our proof.    FORMULA FORMULA
Note that Lemma REF  provides a way to extend
distance-2 colorings of the blocks of FORMULA  to a distance-2 coloring of
the whole of FORMULA . Thus,
by Lemma REF  we can assume our graphs are biconnected,
both when considering clique and chromatic numbers of FORMULA .
For the inductiveness of FORMULA , such an extension property
as Lemma REF , to express FORMULA  directly
in terms of FORMULA  and the inductiveness of the blocks of FORMULA ,
is not as straightforward although it can be done.
This is mainly because the simplicial vertex of a biconnected block
could be a cut-vertex of the graph.
We will consider this better in Section .
Duals of outerplanar graphs.
For our arguments to come we need a few properties about outerplanar
graphs, the first of which is an easy exercise (See {{cite:d33152d2-0d7e-4adb-997f-0d1e410cd72a}}).
Claim 2.3 
Every biconnected outerplanar graph has at least two vertices of degree 2.

To analyze the inductiveness of an outerplanar graph FORMULA ,
it is useful to consider the weak dual of FORMULA , denoted
by FORMULA  and defined in the following:
Lemma 2.4 
Let FORMULA  be an outerplanar graph with an embedding in the plane.
Let FORMULA  be its geometrical dual, and let
FORMULA  be the vertex corresponding
to the infinite face of FORMULA . Then the weak dual graph
FORMULA  is a forest
which satisfies the following:

FORMULA  is tree iff FORMULA  is biconnected.

FORMULA  has maximum degree at most three, if FORMULA  is chordal.


Note that for a biconnected chordal graph FORMULA ,
there is a one-to-one correspondence FORMULA 
between the degree-2 vertices FORMULA  of FORMULA , and the leaves FORMULA 
of FORMULA .
Proof. 
(Lemma REF )
This follows easily by Claim REF  and induction on FORMULA .    FORMULA FORMULA
Note that any biconnected chordal outerplanar graph on FORMULA  vertices can be
constructed in the following way: Start with two
vertices FORMULA  and FORMULA  and connect them with an
edge. For FORMULA  to FORMULA , inductively connect
a vertex FORMULA  to two endvertices of an
edge which bounds the infinite face. Hence,
after the FORMULA -th step, the vertex FORMULA  is of degree 2.
Simultaneously we construct the weak dual
tree FORMULA  on the vertices FORMULA ,
by adding FORMULA  as a leaf to the vertex in FORMULA 
corresponding to the face containing the two neighbors of FORMULA  after
the FORMULA -th step. Hence, we have the following.
Observation 2.5 
For a biconnected chordal outerplanar graph FORMULA , there
are two vertices FORMULA  such that
there is a bijection
FORMULA , given
by FORMULA , such that degree-2 vertices of FORMULA 
correspond to leaves of FORMULA . Further, successfully
removing degree-2 vertices from FORMULA  will result in removing
leaves from FORMULA  in such a way that the mentioned
correspondence will still hold between degree-2 vertices of
the altered graph FORMULA  and the leaves of the altered tree.

By Lemma REF , FORMULA  for a chordal graph FORMULA 
is a tree of maximum degree 3, and hence each of its leaves has
at most one sibling.
Note, however, that if FORMULA  is not chordal then the assignment
FORMULA  is only surjective and not bijective.
Both in the chordal and non-chordal case we will call the vertex
FORMULA  the dual vertex of FORMULA . For the non-chordal case,
such a construction can be done in a similar fashion,
except that we inductively add a path of length
FORMULA  instead of length exactly 2
Faces and dual leafs.
For an outerplanar plane graph FORMULA  two faces of FORMULA  are said to
be adjoint (shortened as adj.) if they share a common vertex.
A FORMULA -face is a face FORMULA  with FORMULA  vertices and FORMULA  edges. This
will be denoted by FORMULA .
For a bounded face FORMULA  of FORMULA  the corresponding dual vertex of FORMULA 
will be denoted by FORMULA . Note for a chordal FORMULA  and if FORMULA  has two
bounding edges bounding the infinite face then FORMULA ,
the dual vertex of FORMULA  from above. We will, however,
speak interchangeably of a face FORMULA  and its corresponding
dual vertex FORMULA  (or FORMULA  from above in the chordal case) from FORMULA ,
when there is no danger of ambiguity, and we will apply standard
forest/tree vocabulary to faces from
the tree terminology given previously when each component
from FORMULA  is rooted at a center.
A sib of a face FORMULA  is a sibling in FORMULA  that
is adjoint to FORMULA .
A face FORMULA  is FORMULA -strongly simplicial, or FORMULA -ss for short, if
either FORMULA  is isolated (that is FORMULA  consists of FORMULA  alone),
or FORMULA  is a leaf in FORMULA  satisfying one of the
following: (i) FORMULA , or (ii) the parent face of FORMULA  in FORMULA  is
FORMULA -ss in FORMULA . Thus, e.g. all leafs are 0-ss, while
those leafs whose siblings have no children are also 1-ss.

Inductiveness
In this section we will derive optimal bounds on inductiveness.
The following is the main result of this section.
Theorem 3.1 
For an outerplanar graph FORMULA  of maximum degree FORMULA ,
we have FORMULA .
If further, FORMULA , then FORMULA .

To bound the inductiveness, it is sufficient to show that there always
exists a vertex that has both small degree and small distance-2 degree.
Recall that a FORMULA -vertex is a vertex of degree at most 2 in FORMULA 
and distance-2 degree at most FORMULA .
Lemma 3.2 
Suppose any outerplanar graph of maximum degree FORMULA  contains a
FORMULA -vertex. Then, any outerplanar graph FORMULA  of maximum degree FORMULA  satisfies
FORMULA .

Proof. 
We show this by induction on FORMULA . Let FORMULA  be an outerplanar graph
with a FORMULA -vertex FORMULA .
We choose one incident edge FORMULA  and
form the contraction FORMULA ; this
is the simple graph obtained from FORMULA  by contracting the edge FORMULA  into a single
vertex FORMULA  and keeping all edges that were incident on either
FORMULA  or FORMULA  (deleting multiple copies). Formally, FORMULA  has the vertex set
FORMULA  and edge set
FORMULA .
The set of distance-2 neighbors
of FORMULA  in FORMULA  properly contains the
set of distance-2 neighbors of FORMULA  in FORMULA . Hence, a
FORMULA -inductive ordering of FORMULA  also gives a FORMULA -inductive ordering of
FORMULA  excluding FORMULA  and where FORMULA  is replaced with FORMULA .
Further, since FORMULA  was of degree at most 2,
the degree of FORMULA  is at most that of FORMULA , and hence the
maximum degree of FORMULA  is at most that of FORMULA .
By induction, there is such a FORMULA -inductive ordering of FORMULA .
By prepending FORMULA  to that ordering, replacing FORMULA  by FORMULA , we
obtain a FORMULA -inductive ordering of FORMULA .    FORMULA FORMULA
Recall that a leaf block FORMULA  of FORMULA  contains just one cutvertex.
Call a block FORMULA  simple if FORMULA ,
that is, FORMULA  is empty, a single vertex, a single edge,
or a star on three or more vertices.
Lemma 3.3 
Any simple leaf block contains a FORMULA -vertex of FORMULA 
if FORMULA  and a FORMULA -vertex if FORMULA .

Proof. 
If FORMULA  is a single edge, then the leaf node is a FORMULA -vertex.
If FORMULA  is a 3-cycle, then either of the non-cut-vertices are FORMULA -vertices.
When FORMULA  is a FORMULA -cycle, for FORMULA , then any node on the
cycle that is not adjacent to the cut vertex is a 4-vertex.
Assume now that FORMULA  is a single edge or a star on FORMULA  vertices.
Clearly we have FORMULA . If FORMULA  contains a degree-2 vertex FORMULA 
of distance 2 or more from the cutvertex, then FORMULA  is a 6-vertex.
So FORMULA  is a FORMULA -vertex if FORMULA  and FORMULA -vertex
if FORMULA . If all the degree-2 vertices of FORMULA  are adjacent
to the cutvertex of FORMULA , then FORMULA  is a diagonalized FORMULA  where FORMULA .
In this case both the degree-2 vertices of FORMULA  are FORMULA -vertices of
FORMULA . Hence we have the lemma.    FORMULA FORMULA
By Lemma REF  we will focus on non-simple
leaf blocks for the rest of this section.
We start our search for a FORMULA -vertex at a face that has some nice properties.
Recall the definition of a FORMULA -ss face. Notice that a face is 1-ss
iff its parent in FORMULA  has no grandchildren, while it is 2-ss if
it either has no grandparent in FORMULA , or if its grandparent is not the 3-rd
ancestor of another face. Note that if FORMULA  is not simple, then for any rooting
of FORMULA  there are always faces with parents and grandparents.
Lemma 3.4 
Let FORMULA  be a non-simple leaf block of FORMULA  and let FORMULA  be a
non-negative integer.
Then, FORMULA  contains an FORMULA -ss face FORMULA , its parent FORMULA , its
grandparent FORMULA  and an edge FORMULA  on the boundary of FORMULA , such that
FORMULA  separates FORMULA  and all its descendants (its children and
grandchildren) from the rest of FORMULA .

Proof. 
If FORMULA  is biconnected let FORMULA  be any face. Otherwise, if FORMULA ,
let FORMULA  be any face that contains the cutvertex on its boundary and an
edge bounding the infinite face.
Let FORMULA  be rooted at FORMULA  and let FORMULA  be a face of maximum
distance from FORMULA  in FORMULA . It is not hard to see that
the center(s) of FORMULA  is(are) on the path from FORMULA  to FORMULA ,
and hence FORMULA  is an endvertex of a maximum length path of FORMULA .
By definition of FORMULA -ss, FORMULA  is therefore FORMULA -ss for any FORMULA .
Also, FORMULA  has a parent FORMULA  and a grandparent FORMULA .
If FORMULA  has a great-grandparent FORMULA , then we let FORMULA  be the edge
that separates FORMULA  from FORMULA  in FORMULA . This edge separates
FORMULA  and all its descendants from the rest of FORMULA , including FORMULA 
and thus necessarily also from the rest of FORMULA .
If FORMULA  has no great-grandparent, then FORMULA  and we let FORMULA  be
an edge incident on the cutvertex and the infinite face.    FORMULA FORMULA
Claim 3.5 
Assume that we have faces FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  in a block FORMULA  of FORMULA 
as promised by Lemma REF .

If FORMULA  is the edge separating FORMULA  from FORMULA , then either
FORMULA  or FORMULA  has degree at most 6 in FORMULA .

If FORMULA  is the edge separating FORMULA  from FORMULA , then either
FORMULA  or FORMULA  has degree at most 4 in FORMULA .


Proof. 
Note that the cutvertex is either neither of the endvertices
of the edge FORMULA  that separates FORMULA  and all its descendants
from the rest of FORMULA , or one of them.
The first statement is true since FORMULA  is 2-ss in the block FORMULA ,
and the second statement is true since FORMULA  is 1-ss in FORMULA .    FORMULA FORMULA
Reducible configurations.
A configuration is an induced plane subgraph with certain
vertices specially marked as having no neighbors outside the subgraph.
A configuration is FORMULA -reducible for an
integer FORMULA , if there exists a FORMULA -vertex for it. When FORMULA  is
understood, we shall simply speak of a reducible configuration.
We will give an exhaustive decision
tree, or a flowchart, that leads to a reducible configuration:
A FORMULA -reducible one when FORMULA  in
Figure REF ,
and FORMULA -reducible when FORMULA  in
Figure REF .
Each of the boxes of the branches
corresponds to one of the reducible configurations
of Figures REF -REF , to be described shortly.
We shall assume that we are given FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA  as promised by
Lemma REF . In the flowchart we use the following
notation: Recall that the cardinality of a face FORMULA , denoted FORMULA , is its number
of vertices. FORMULA  is incident on FORMULA  if it contains one of its
vertices. We shall assume that if FORMULA  is incident on one of the
vertices of FORMULA , then that vertex will be named FORMULA .
When traversing the flowchart (either one in Figure REF ), we
shall assume that all sibs of a face
are tested for a Y branch before proceeding to the corresponding N branch.
FIGURE 
Each of the subfigures (A)-(J) in Figures REF -REF 
gives a configuration with a FORMULA -vertex marked as FORMULA .
Each of them expresses more generally a collection of configurations,
allowing for optional vertices as well as symmetric translations.
Edges that lie on the infinite face are shown in bold, while internal
edges are thin. Optional vertices and edges are shown with dotted edges.
Vertices shown in white have possible additional edges, while
all neighbors of dark vertices (in blue) are shown in the figure.
We mark an FORMULA -ss face FORMULA  in the figure, along with its
parent FORMULA .

A set of configurations is unavoidable for a class of graphs if
every graph in the class contains at least one configuration from the set.
Our main technique, that bears a slight resemblance to the four color
theorem {{cite:f8881c3a-ef7f-475a-94f5-415166eeefeb}}, is to give an unavoidable set of reducible configurations.
For reductions (B), (C), (D), (G), (H), and (I) to apply, FORMULA  must be 1-ss,
while for (E), (F), or (J) to apply, FORMULA  must be 2-ss.
Lemma 3.6 
FORMULA  from Figures REF -REF 
is an unavoidable set of FORMULA -configurations,
for the class of outerplanar graphs of maximum degree FORMULA 
with no simple leaf blocks.

Proof. 
We basically go through the flowchart in Figure REF .
Assume FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA  as promised by Lemma REF .
If FORMULA , then we have either case (REF ) or (REF ).
Assume then that FORMULA  and consider its parent face FORMULA .
If FORMULA , then we have case (REF ); otherwise, assume FORMULA .
If FORMULA  (or one of its sibs) is not incident on FORMULA ,
then case (REF ) holds. Otherwise, FORMULA  is missing a sib on at
least one side, so some edge of FORMULA  borders the infinite face, in which case
(REF ) holds. In each case we obtain a FORMULA -vertex
and hence we have the lemma.    FORMULA FORMULA
From the above proof and Figure REF  we obtain
the following.
Corollary 3.7 
In each of the configurations from the unavoidable set FORMULA 
in Lemma REF , our FORMULA -vertex
is on the boundary of the 1-ss face FORMULA .

We have similarly the following for FORMULA .
Lemma 3.8 
FORMULA  from Figures REF -REF 
is an unavoidable set of FORMULA -configurations,
for the class of outerplanar graphs of maximum degree FORMULA 
with no simple leaf blocks.

Proof. 
We traverse the flowchart in Figure REF .
Assume FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA  as promised by Lemma REF .
If FORMULA , then we have either of cases (REF )
and (REF ). Hence, we assume from now that FORMULA .
Consider the case FORMULA . If FORMULA  has no sibling,
then the case (REF ) applies and we have a FORMULA -vertex.
Otherwise, FORMULA  has a sibling, which we can (by the above) assume
is also a 3-face. Since both FORMULA  and its sibling are 2-ss, then
one of them is bounded by three vertices of degree 2, 4 and at most 6 in FORMULA .
W.l.o.g. we may assume FORMULA  to be this very face, in which case
(REF ) applies and we have a 7-vertex.
Consider now the case FORMULA . If FORMULA  is not incident on FORMULA ,
then the case (REF ) applies and we have a 6-vertex.
Otherwise, assume FORMULA  (and all of its possible sibs) is incident on FORMULA ,
in particular on FORMULA .
If FORMULA , then FORMULA  has a 6-vertex
as indicated in case (REF ); otherwise, assume FORMULA .
Note that we are under the assumption that FORMULA  has no adjoint sibling
(since in that case we would have (REF )).
By Claim REF  we have that since FORMULA  is a 2-ss face, then
FORMULA  and FORMULA  cannot both be of degree FORMULA .
Namely, only one of them can be incident on faces that descend from
FORMULA  or its parent FORMULA  (if it exists).
The other has 3 edges incident on FORMULA  and FORMULA  together, and at
most 3 edges incident on a sib of FORMULA  and its possible child.
If FORMULA  (which is incident on FORMULA ) has degree 6 or less, then
we have case (REF ), so FORMULA  contains a 7-vertex. Otherwise,
FORMULA  has degree 6 or less.
We may for symmetric reasons assume that FORMULA  is the only child of FORMULA 
(as otherwise, the other child would work in the
case (REF ) instead of FORMULA ).
Then, in fact, FORMULA  must have degree 5 or less, because it has only 2
edges incident on FORMULA  and its children.
Then, the parent FORMULA  contains a 7-vertex as indicated
in case (REF ), since the neighbors of the
unique degree-2 vertex on FORMULA  have degree 3 and 5.
This shows that in each case there is a
FORMULA -vertex in FORMULA  and we have the lemma.    FORMULA FORMULA
Unlike the previous case of FORMULA , it is not always the case
that the face FORMULA  contains
a FORMULA -vertex when FORMULA . By
Lemmas REF  and REF  we have
proved Theorem REF  in the cases when
FORMULA .
We complete the proof by finishing the low-degree cases.
Cases with FORMULA .
For FORMULA  we have FORMULA .
In fact we have
FORMULA 
For FORMULA  we have the following.
Lemma 3.9 
For a outerplanar graph FORMULA  with FORMULA ,
we have FORMULA .

Proof. 
By Lemma REF , it suffices to show
that FORMULA  contains a FORMULA -vertex.
If FORMULA  contains a degree-1 vertex, then it is a FORMULA -vertex.
Otherwise, let FORMULA  be a leaf face in the dual tree FORMULA .
If FORMULA , then FORMULA  has a 4-vertex,
while if FORMULA  then either of the degree-2 vertices of FORMULA  are FORMULA -vertices.
Finally, if FORMULA , then the two neighbors of the degree-2 vertex
FORMULA  have at most FORMULA  additional neighbors each.
Hence, FORMULA  is a FORMULA  vertex.    FORMULA FORMULA
Choosability and algorithmic concerns.
As mentioned in Section , the bound on the inductiveness
of Theorem REF  implies that Greedy finds
an optimal coloring of squares of outerplanar graphs of degree FORMULA .
When FORMULA , we can also obtain an efficient time
algorithm from the observation of Krumke, Marathe and Ravi {{cite:6b80829b-c33c-4ec3-babe-dbbaf2701f70}}
that squares of outerplanar graphs have treewidth at most FORMULA .
This allows for the use of FORMULA -time algorithm for coloring
graphs of treewidth FORMULA .
Theorem 3.10 
There is a linear time algorithm to color squares of outerplanar graphs.

List coloring.
Our approach for coloring FORMULA  for an outerplanar graph FORMULA  also
yields results regarding
the list coloring, a. k. a. choosability, of FORMULA  as well.
Definition 3.11 
A graph FORMULA  is FORMULA -choosable
if for every collection of lists
FORMULA  of colors where FORMULA  for
each FORMULA , there is a coloring
FORMULA ,
such that FORMULA  for each FORMULA .
The minimum such FORMULA  is called the choosability or
the list-chromatic number of FORMULA ,
and is denoted by FORMULA .

Note that if a graph is FORMULA -choosable, then it is FORMULA -colorable.
Also, by an easy induction,
we see that if a graph is FORMULA -inductive then it is FORMULA -choosable.
For any graph FORMULA  we therefore have FORMULA .
We thus obtain the following bound on choosability.
Corollary 3.12 
For any outerplanar graph FORMULA  with maximum degree FORMULA ,
we have FORMULA  and this is optimal.


Chordal outerplanar graphs
Before we consider in detail the clique number and the chromatic
number for FORMULA  for an outerplanar graph in general, we will deal
with the chordal case first. This is because many chordal examples will
provide the matching lower bounds for the inductiveness, clique number
and the chromatic number as well. Here in the chordal case
we are able to present some structural results of FORMULA  in addition
to tight bounds of the three coloring parameters.
Conventions: (i) Let FORMULA  be a given biconnected outerplanar
on FORMULA  vertices of maximum degree FORMULA ,
with a fixed planar embedding. The graph obtain from FORMULA  by
connecting an additional vertex to each pair of endvertices
of an edge bounding the infinite face, will be denoted
by FORMULA . Clearly FORMULA  will be an outerplanar graph on
FORMULA  vertices of maximum degree FORMULA .
(ii) By the rigid FORMULA -ladder or just the rigid ladder
FORMULA  on FORMULA  vertices we will mean the graph given by
FORMULA 
For odd FORMULA , the graph FORMULA  will mean FORMULA .
(iii) Let FORMULA , FORMULA ,
and FORMULA , see Figure REF .
FIGURE 
Recall that when discussing the clique number or the chromatic number,
we can by Lemma REF  assume FORMULA  to be biconnected.
One of the main results of this section is the following theorem.
Theorem 4.1 
For a chordal outerplanar graph FORMULA ,
FORMULA 

We also derive a similar characterization of their inductiveness.
First note that the case FORMULA  is trivial, since there is only
one biconnected chordal outerplanar graph, namely FORMULA .
The case FORMULA  is easy, since there are only
three biconnected chordal outerplanar graphs
with FORMULA : FORMULA  the 2-path,
FORMULA  the 3-cycle, and FORMULA  is the 4-cycle with one diagonal.
From this we deduce the following tree-like structure of FORMULA  in this case.
Lemma 4.2 
Let FORMULA  be a chordal outerplanar graph of maximum degree
FORMULA . Then the blocks of FORMULA  are among
FORMULA , where any two blocks from
FORMULA  are separated by at least one FORMULA  block.

Considering the leaf blocks of FORMULA , we obtain from the structure
given in Lemma REF  the following.
Theorem 4.3 
For a chordal outerplanar graph FORMULA  with FORMULA ,
we have
FORMULA 

The case FORMULA  is more interesting, since it is the first
case involving a “forbidden subgraph” condition for both
the clique and the chromatic number of FORMULA .
By considering the removal of a degree-2 vertex from FORMULA , we obtain
the following by induction on FORMULA .
Lemma 4.4 
A graph FORMULA  is a biconnected chordal outerplanar graph with FORMULA  if,
and only if, FORMULA .

Proof. 
Clearly each graph in FORMULA  is biconnected
and outerplanar. Conversely, let FORMULA  be a biconnected outerplanar graph
on FORMULA  vertices with maximum degree four.
By removing a vertex FORMULA  of degree 2 from FORMULA , we obtain
a biconnected outerplanar graph FORMULA  with FORMULA ,
and hence equal to FORMULA  or, by induction, from
the set FORMULA .
Since FORMULA  is of maximum degree FORMULA  it is impossible that
FORMULA . For the same reason if FORMULA , then FORMULA .
Also, FORMULA  only when FORMULA , and lastly if FORMULA 
for some FORMULA , then FORMULA  must hold,
thereby proving the lemma.    FORMULA FORMULA
Note that for FORMULA  we have FORMULA . Hence, in this case
FORMULA , while FORMULA .
Observe that FORMULA , for any FORMULA , since removing the
last vertex in the square graph leaves the graph FORMULA .
Thus, FORMULA .
By Lemmas REF  and REF  we have the following.
Theorem 4.5 
For a chordal outerplanar graph FORMULA  with FORMULA , we
have
FORMULA 

So far we have characterized chordal outerplanar graphs in terms
of the clique number, chromatic number and inductiveness of their squares
when FORMULA .
Before we continue with the analysis of the chordal cases
of FORMULA , we need the following definition and a lemma.
Definition 4.6 
Let FORMULA  be a graph.
Call a subgraph FORMULA  on FORMULA  vertices
an FORMULA -separator, or just a separator if
it induces a clique in FORMULA  whose removal breaks FORMULA  into
disconnected components.

The following lemma shows that it suffices to bound the clique number and
chromatic number for graphs without separators.
Lemma 4.7 
Let FORMULA  be a graph and FORMULA  a separator of FORMULA 
with FORMULA  and FORMULA . Then we have
FORMULA 

Proof. 
Since FORMULA  and FORMULA , which
is a clique, we have the stated clique number for FORMULA .
Further, any optimal coloring of either FORMULA  or FORMULA 
can be extended to an optimal coloring of FORMULA  by a suitable permutation
of the colors. Hence we have the lemma.    FORMULA FORMULA
Recall that a tree is full if there are no vertices of
degree 2.
Lemma 4.8 
Let FORMULA  be a biconnected chordal outerplanar graph with a
full weak dual FORMULA .

If FORMULA , then FORMULA .

If FORMULA , then FORMULA .


Proof. 
Since FORMULA  is chordal it is uniquely determined by a plane
embedding of its full weak dual FORMULA .
If FORMULA , then FORMULA  contains
a path of length FORMULA  and since FORMULA  is full
each internal vertex of this path must have degree of three.
Therefore FORMULA  has at least FORMULA  vertices
and so FORMULA  has FORMULA  vertices.
The unique full tree on FORMULA  vertices is the weak dual of
FORMULA  on FORMULA 
vertices and with maximum degree FORMULA .
Proceeding by induction, assume FORMULA  has FORMULA  vertices
has a full weak dual FORMULA  on FORMULA  vertices.
Removing two siblings from FORMULA 
whose parent is a leaf in the pruned tree FORMULA  corresponds
to removing two degree-2 vertices FORMULA  and FORMULA  from FORMULA  of distance 2 from each
other in FORMULA , and obtaining FORMULA .
Now FORMULA  is full and has FORMULA 
vertices, since its maximum degree is three.
If FORMULA  has four vertices, then it is the unique 4-star
and FORMULA . Hence FORMULA  and FORMULA  here.
Note that the number of vertices in any full tree with maximum
degree of three is always even. Hence, there are no full trees
on five or seven vertices.
If FORMULA  has six vertices, then FORMULA  is unique and
FORMULA . Hence FORMULA  in this case and FORMULA .
Otherwise FORMULA  must have at least eight vertices and
hence FORMULA  has at least ten vertices. By induction hypothesis we
have FORMULA . To have
FORMULA  is impossible, since that would create FORMULA  with FORMULA .
So FORMULA  for some FORMULA .
If FORMULA  then either FORMULA  or FORMULA .
Otherwise FORMULA , which completes the proof.    FORMULA FORMULA
Theorem 4.9 
Let FORMULA  be a biconnected chordal outerplanar graph with FORMULA .
If FORMULA  is not full, then either FORMULA  is a clique or FORMULA 
has an FORMULA -separator where FORMULA .

Proof. 
Note that since FORMULA  is chordal, then every face corresponding to a vertex in
FORMULA  is bounded by a triangle. So for a given FORMULA ,
the structure of FORMULA  is determined except for the degree-2 vertices of FORMULA .
By assumption FORMULA  has a degree-2 vertex. We consider the
following three cases.
If FORMULA  has no vertex of degree 3, then FORMULA  is a simple path.
In this case it is easy to see that FORMULA  has a path decomposition consisting
of cliques, where each clique is induced by a closed neighborhood of a vertex
of FORMULA , necessarily of of size 5, 6 or 7. In particular, FORMULA  is
by {{cite:815246cd-c0ef-4445-9a54-4880427a3bb3}} a chordal graph and is therefore a clique
or has a 4-separator.
Consider next the case where FORMULA  has a degree-2 vertex FORMULA  that lies on
a path connecting two degree-3 vertices of FORMULA . If FORMULA  is the unique edge
in FORMULA  bounding the triangular face FORMULA  corresponding to FORMULA  and the infinite face, then
let FORMULA  be the vertex opposite the edge FORMULA  in the triangle FORMULA . Since FORMULA  and two
other edges FORMULA  and FORMULA  incident to FORMULA  in FORMULA  all bound the infinite face of FORMULA ,
we see that the closed neighborhood of FORMULA  is an FORMULA -separator of FORMULA ,
where FORMULA .
Lastly, consider the case where every degree-2 vertex of FORMULA  lies
on a path connecting a degree-3 vertex and a leaf of FORMULA .
In this case FORMULA  must contain a degree-2 vertex FORMULA  that has
a leaf FORMULA  as a neighbor. Let FORMULA  be the vertices
bounding the triangular face FORMULA  corresponding to the leaf FORMULA , where FORMULA 
has degree 2 in FORMULA  and FORMULA  has degree 2 in FORMULA . Note that
FORMULA  is a leaf in FORMULA . In this case FORMULA 
induces a clique in FORMULA  which separates FORMULA  from the rest of the graph
FORMULA . Since FORMULA  has a vertex of degree 3, then FORMULA  has at least
two components where one component consists of the singleton FORMULA .
Hence, FORMULA  induces an FORMULA -separator of size FORMULA .
This completes our proof.    FORMULA FORMULA
Note that FORMULA  is FORMULA  with
two perpendicular diagonals removed when the vertices are located
on a regular 8-gon. Therefore these two pairs of opposite nonadjacent
vertices can be colored by the same color in FORMULA , and hence
FORMULA .
We note further that FORMULA  is biconnected chordal outerplanar graph with
FORMULA . Also, the subgraph FORMULA  in FORMULA  induces a
clique in FORMULA , and hence
each vertex there must have a unique color, say cyclically with colors
FORMULA  starting with a degree-2 vertex of FORMULA .
Of the remaining six vertices of FORMULA , color three of them with a new
color 7, all of distance three apart, and the remaining three with the
colors 1, 3 and 5. Hence FORMULA .
To color FORMULA  we can start by coloring the degree-2 vertices of
FORMULA  alternatively with colors 1 and 2 cyclically. The rest of
the vertices, that constitute FORMULA , we can then color with the remaining five
available colors, since we have already that FORMULA .
Hence we have FORMULA .
With the above in mind together with
Lemmas REF , REF , and REF 
and Theorems REF  and REF 
we obtain in particular the following.
Corollary 4.10 
For a chordal outerplanar graph FORMULA  with FORMULA  we
have
FORMULA 

Corollary REF  together with Theorems REF 
and REF  complete the proof of Theorem REF  as
well as the entries in Table REF  in the
chordal case for FORMULA .
Observation 4.11 
For each FORMULA , there are infinitely
many biconnected chordal outerplanar
graphs FORMULA  of maximum degree FORMULA 
with FORMULA .

Proof. 
It suffices to show that for each FORMULA  there are
infinitely many biconnected outerplanar graphs FORMULA 
whose squares are of minimum degree FORMULA .
Refer to Figure REF  for the appearance of the graphs.
For FORMULA , consider FORMULA ,
whose square is FORMULA  and hence has a minimum degree FORMULA .
By fusing together edges whose endvertices have degrees
two and four, in two or more copies of FORMULA , we can
construct an infinite family of such biconnected outerplanar
graphs FORMULA  with FORMULA  with FORMULA .
For FORMULA , consider FORMULA ,
whose square is FORMULA  with two perpendicular diagonals
removed when the vertices are located on a regular 8-gon.
Also in this case we can fuse together two edges
with endvertices of degree 2 and 5, of two or more
copies of FORMULA , and obtain
an infinite family of such biconnected outerplanar
graphs FORMULA  with FORMULA  with FORMULA .
Finally, for FORMULA , consider FORMULA .
In this case we have FORMULA , and also
here we can fuse edges with endvertices of degree
2 and 4, of two or more copies of FORMULA ,
to form an infinite family of biconnected
outerplanar graphs FORMULA  of maximum degree FORMULA 
and with FORMULA .
This completes the proof.    FORMULA FORMULA
Remark: We note that FORMULA 
is chordal, but neither FORMULA  nor FORMULA 
are chordal, showing that the square of a chordal
graph does not need to be chordal.
This is consistent with the characterization of those chordal graphs
whose squares are chordal given
in {{cite:39bf0393-3fc4-41aa-b7a3-30f39073d627}}.
Theorem 4.12 
For a chordal outerplanar graph FORMULA , we have
FORMULA  or FORMULA .
Necessary and sufficient conditions that FORMULA , are
one of the following:

FORMULA  and FORMULA ,

FORMULA  and FORMULA , or

FORMULA  and one of FORMULA , FORMULA , is a
subgraph of FORMULA .


Clique number
In this section we deal with the clique number of FORMULA . This parameter
is the easiest to deal with. Nonetheless the exact computation of
the clique number will rely on some results in previous
Sections  and . Recall that
by Lemma REF  we can assume FORMULA  to be biconnected.
Further, FORMULA  is here not necessarily chordal.
Lemma 5.1 
For an outerplanar graph FORMULA  we have FORMULA , unless FORMULA .
If FORMULA , then FORMULA .
For FORMULA  we further have that any clique with
FORMULA  vertices is the closed neighborhood of some vertex.

Proof. 
Consider an induced subgraph FORMULA  of FORMULA  with FORMULA  vertices:
a vertex FORMULA  and its neighbors FORMULA  in a clockwise order in the
plane embedding of FORMULA . Then only adjacent pairs FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
for FORMULA , may be connected by an edge. Consider now a
vertex FORMULA  that is not a neighbor of FORMULA . Then,
FORMULA  can be adjacent to at most two neighbors of FORMULA  and only
consecutive ones, by the outerplanarity property.
If FORMULA , then FORMULA  cannot be adjacent to both one of FORMULA  and FORMULA 
and to one of FORMULA  and FORMULA . Thus, it must be of distance at
least 3 from either FORMULA  or FORMULA . Hence, FORMULA  is not a
clique in FORMULA . This shows that if a clique in FORMULA  contains
a closed neighborhood of a vertex of degree FORMULA , then
the clique consists precisely of those FORMULA  vertices.
Consider now the case FORMULA  and we have two vertices FORMULA  and FORMULA 
that are non-neighbors of FORMULA . In order to be of distance at most 2
from both FORMULA  and FORMULA , a vertex must be adjacent to FORMULA  and
FORMULA . But, in an outerplanar graph, not both FORMULA  and FORMULA  can be
so. Hence, FORMULA  does not form a clique.
This shows that if a clique in FORMULA  contains a closed neighborhood
of a vertex of degree FORMULA , then the clique consists of at most
FORMULA  vertices, the vertices of the closed neighborhood plus
a possibly additional vertex.
Suppose now an induced subgraph FORMULA  of maximum degree 3
induces a 6-clique in FORMULA .
Recall that by Lemma REF  we assume FORMULA  to be biconnected
and therefore induced by a cycle. There can be at most two chords in FORMULA  and
they must be disjoint since
FORMULA . Then there are two vertices in FORMULA  of degree 2 that
are of distance 3 in FORMULA . Further, since all vertices of FORMULA  lie on the
outer face, there can be no vertex outside FORMULA  connecting them.
From the above paragraphs we conclude that if a clique of FORMULA 
contains FORMULA  vertices, it must be a closed neighborhood
of a vertex of degree FORMULA .
Hence, the lemma.    FORMULA FORMULA
We conclude this section by quickly discussing matching
lower bounds for FORMULA .
Note, that we are here still under the assumption that FORMULA  is biconnected.
If FORMULA , then FORMULA  is a cycle on FORMULA  vertices
and we clearly have
FORMULA 
For FORMULA  the upper bound of FORMULA  is matched if FORMULA 
is the graph obtained by adding one chord to the 5-cycle FORMULA .
For FORMULA  the matching upper bound of both FORMULA 
when FORMULA  and FORMULA  when FORMULA  is obtain
when FORMULA  shown in Figure REF .
If FORMULA , then by the above Lemma REF ,
the matching upper bound of FORMULA  is obtained
by a closed neighborhood of any vertex of degree FORMULA .
Together with what was obtained in the previous
Section , we therefore have all the
entries for FORMULA  for an outerplanar graph FORMULA  (chordal or not)
displayed in Table REF .
The chromatic number
Recall that for an outerplanar graph FORMULA  with FORMULA 
we have by Theorem REF  that FORMULA 
and hence FORMULA  which is optimal.
(In fact, Lemmas REF  and REF 
also imply this.) Hence, we will assume throughout this
section that FORMULA .
Cases with  FORMULA
If FORMULA , then we have an upper bound
FORMULA 
and a matching lower bound is obtained when
FORMULA . In fact, if FORMULA  is FORMULA  (resp. FORMULA ) the path (resp. cycle)
on FORMULA  vertices, then FORMULA  and
it can be verified that for FORMULA  we have that
FORMULA 
Further, Greedy obtains an optimal coloring even when inductiveness
is not a tight bound on the chromatic number, that is on FORMULA  for FORMULA .
For FORMULA  and FORMULA , we have an upper bound of
FORMULA .
If FORMULA  is the graph obtained by adding a chord to the
5-cycle FORMULA , then FORMULA  is a clique and hence
the lower bound for FORMULA  is obtained
for FORMULA .
Consider now the case FORMULA . Let FORMULA  be the graph
on ten vertices given in (REF ) in Figure REF .
FIGURE 
To see that FORMULA  requires 7 colors, it is easiest to try to
cover with cliques the complement graph FORMULA , shown in
(REF ) in Figure REF .
Each of the vertices FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  require their own clique,
while for the remaining 7 vertices, there is no 3-clique. Hence, 7 cliques are
required to cover FORMULA . That is, 7 colors are required
to color FORMULA . We note that FORMULA  has four edges with
endvertices of degree 2 and 3 respectively. By fusing together
two copies of FORMULA  along
these edges in such a way that a degree-2 vertex in one copy is
identified with a degree-3 vertex in another copy, we can make an
infinite family of outerplanar graphs with FORMULA , such that their
square has chromatic number of 7. We summarize in the following.
Theorem 6.1 
There are infinitely many biconnected outerplanar graphs FORMULA  with
maximum degree FORMULA  such that FORMULA .


Cases with  FORMULA
Although it is impossible to obtain the tight
bound of FORMULA  in the case when FORMULA 
via the inductiveness of FORMULA , our approach here
will in similar fashion be inductive: We show how we
can extend an optimal coloring of the square of
a subgraph FORMULA  of FORMULA  to that of FORMULA .
Lemma 6.2 
If FORMULA  is an outerplanar graph with maximum degree FORMULA ,
then FORMULA .

Proof. 
By Lemma REF  we may assume FORMULA  to be biconnected.
Since FORMULA , then FORMULA  is a proper tree and
hence each 0-ss face FORMULA  has a parent FORMULA .
If we can find a FORMULA -vertex in FORMULA , for FORMULA , then a 6-coloring of
FORMULA  follows by induction on FORMULA .
Observe that if FORMULA ,
then each degree-2 vertex of FORMULA  is a 5-vertex. If FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
then the unique degree-2 vertex on FORMULA  is a 5-vertex.
Additionally, if FORMULA  and FORMULA  has a face bounding the infinite
face, then one 0-ss child of FORMULA  has a 5-vertex.
Hence, we can assume that each 0-ss face is a 3-face
whose parent FORMULA  satisfies FORMULA  and has no edge bounding the
infinite face.
This implies one of the following two possibilities: (i)
FORMULA  has a grandparent FORMULA , or (ii) every edge of FORMULA 
also bounds a child of FORMULA . In this case we can simply
choose one designated child to play the role of the grandparent FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be the vertices of FORMULA  where FORMULA ,
and FORMULA  be the edge bordering FORMULA . Let FORMULA  be the vertices such that
FORMULA  is a 0-ss child of FORMULA , for FORMULA .
Finally, since FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  have at most one additional
neighbor each; denote them by FORMULA  and FORMULA , respectively, which are not
necessarily distinct.
Let FORMULA  be the graph obtained after eliminating the face FORMULA  and its
children (i.e., removing vertices
FORMULA , FORMULA  and incident edges from FORMULA .)
We show that a 6-coloring of FORMULA  can be extended to a 6-coloring of FORMULA .
Since, this is the lone remaining case for FORMULA , this
yields the lemma.
First case  FORMULA:
For FORMULA  we first color FORMULA  and FORMULA  with a same color
that is unused at FORMULA . Then color the vertices FORMULA 
in a greedy fashion in this order, using at most 6 colors.
For FORMULA  we first color FORMULA  and FORMULA  with a same color
that is unused at FORMULA . Then color FORMULA  and FORMULA  with a same
color that is unused at FORMULA  and FORMULA  (at most five colors used on these
six vertices). Finally color FORMULA  in a greedy fashion in this order,
using at most 6 colors.
Second case FORMULA :
Note that in a coloring of FORMULA  in the previous case, FORMULA 
all receive distinct colors since they
induce a clique in FORMULA . Assume these colors are FORMULA 
in this order respectively.
Such a coloring can now be extended to a case of FORMULA 
by coloring FORMULA 
using the colors FORMULA  in this order respectively.
Since each case of FORMULA  can be obtained by repeated use of such an
extension, we have the lemma.    FORMULA FORMULA
Cases with  FORMULA
We now delve into the case where FORMULA  is an outerplanar graph with FORMULA ,
and we will show that
FORMULA  always holds here. By
Lemma REF  we shall assume FORMULA  to be biconnected and hence,
by Lemma REF , its weak dual FORMULA  to be a connected tree.
As in Section , we will reduce our considerations to
some key cases regarding the weak dual FORMULA  of FORMULA . We will assume,
unless otherwise stated, that FORMULA  is a biconnected outerplanar plane graph
with FORMULA  with FORMULA  as a connected tree.
Assuming FORMULA , and that FORMULA  is minimal with this property
(that is, any other graph with FORMULA  has its square 7-colorable),
we note that we can assume that we do not have configurations (A) and (B)
shown in Figure REF  nor configuration (C) in Figure REF ,
(since in those cases we would have a 6-vertex, contradicting
our assumption on FORMULA .). In other words, we may assume that
(i) each face FORMULA  with FORMULA  a leaf in FORMULA  is bounded by three or four edges,
(ii) each 1-ss face FORMULA  is bounded by exactly three vertices, and
(iii) each 1-ss face FORMULA  has at most on sibling in FORMULA .
We say that FORMULA  is 3-restricted if it
satisfies all these assumptions (i), (ii) and (iii).
In addition we have the following for the parent FORMULA  of FORMULA  in FORMULA .
Lemma 6.3 
If FORMULA  is 3-restricted, FORMULA  a 1-ss face and FORMULA ,
then either FORMULA  or FORMULA  contains a 6-vertex.

Proof. 
Note that FORMULA  (that is to say FORMULA ) is a leaf in the pruned tree
FORMULA . Let
FORMULA  be bounded by the vertices FORMULA  with FORMULA 
and where FORMULA  it the edge in FORMULA  that boarders the grandparent
FORMULA  (that is to say, is dual to
the edge in FORMULA  incident to FORMULA ).
If FORMULA  and FORMULA  are on the boundary of either FORMULA  or its unique sibling
FORMULA  (in the case that FORMULA  has a sibling FORMULA ) for some FORMULA ,
then the degree-two vertex on either FORMULA  or FORMULA  has degree at most five in FORMULA .
Otherwise, all the FORMULA  edges
FORMULA  bound the infinite face of FORMULA ,
in which case the FORMULA  vertices, FORMULA ,
all are degree-two vertices with at most six neighbors in FORMULA .
This completes the proof.    FORMULA FORMULA
Consider further the case for a 3-restricted FORMULA  where FORMULA  is a 1-ss
face of FORMULA , the face FORMULA  is bounded by four vertices
FORMULA  and FORMULA  is bounded by FORMULA  in such a way
that the edges FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  all bound the
infinite face of FORMULA . In this
case both FORMULA  and FORMULA  have degree three in FORMULA  and hence the degree-two vertex
FORMULA  has four neighbors in FORMULA . To avoid any vertices of degree FORMULA  in FORMULA ,
we can therefore assume that if, for any 1-ss face FORMULA 
with FORMULA  bounded by the four vertices FORMULA , then the edge
FORMULA  must bound the infinite face of FORMULA .
To make further restrictions, assume that FORMULA  is a biconnected outerplanar
graph that is induced by the cycle FORMULA  on the vertices FORMULA 
in clockwise order. If FORMULA  and FORMULA  is adjacent to both FORMULA  and FORMULA  in FORMULA ,
then for any coloring of the square FORMULA  the vertices FORMULA 
must all receive distinct
colors, say FORMULA  respectively, since FORMULA 
induces a clique in FORMULA . Consider the outerplanar graph FORMULA  obtained by
first removing both the edges FORMULA  and FORMULA  and then connecting
a new vertex FORMULA  to each of the vertices FORMULA  and FORMULA . In this way
FORMULA  becomes the contraction of FORMULA , namely FORMULA . Note that
if FORMULA  has a maximum degree of FORMULA , then so does FORMULA . In addition, given
the mentioned coloring of FORMULA  where FORMULA  has color FORMULA  for FORMULA ,
then we can obtain a coloring
of FORMULA  by retaining the colors of FORMULA  from FORMULA  for all FORMULA ,
and then assigning colors FORMULA  to
the vertices FORMULA  respectively.
Definition 6.4 
A biconnected outerplanar graph FORMULA  with maximum degree FORMULA 
and a minimum number of vertices satisfying FORMULA  is called
a minimal criminal.

Clearly each minimal criminal must be 3-restricted.
What our discussion preceding the above definition means, in particular,
is the following additional property of a potential minimal criminal FORMULA .
Theorem 6.5 
If FORMULA  is a minimal criminal, then FORMULA  has no degree-two vertices
with FORMULA  neighbors in FORMULA . Further, let FORMULA  be a
1-ss face of FORMULA .

If FORMULA  has no sibling, then FORMULA  is bounded by four vertices. Further,
all the faces FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  have exactly on vertex in common on their boundaries.

If FORMULA  has one sibling FORMULA , then FORMULA  is bounded by three vertices.
Hence, all the faces FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  are bounded by exactly three vertices and edges.


Proof. 
If FORMULA  has no sibling and FORMULA  is bounded by three vertices and edges,
then the degree-two vertex FORMULA  bounding FORMULA  has FORMULA  neighbors in FORMULA .
Then by minimality of FORMULA , the square of FORMULA  can be colored by at most seven
colors, and hence so can FORMULA , since there is at least on color left for FORMULA 
among the seven colors available. If further FORMULA  is bounded by four vertices
and the faces FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  have no common vertex on their boundaries,
then as previously noted, FORMULA  has exactly four neighbors in FORMULA 
since both neighbors of FORMULA  have degree three in FORMULA .
If FORMULA  has one sibling FORMULA , and FORMULA  is bounded by four vertices
FORMULA , then the edge FORMULA  bounds neither FORMULA  nor
FORMULA  (since otherwise either FORMULA  or FORMULA  has a degree-two vertex on its
boundary with at most five neighbors in FORMULA ) and therefore (assuming FORMULA  is
to the left of FORMULA  in the plane embedding of FORMULA ) we have that
FORMULA  bounds FORMULA , the edge FORMULA  bounds FORMULA  and FORMULA  bounds
the infinite face of FORMULA . Again, by minimality of FORMULA  we have that
the the square of the contracted graph FORMULA  has a legitimate
7-coloring. By our above discussion preceding Definition REF ,
this coloring can then be extended to a 7-coloring of FORMULA , thereby
contradicting the criminality of FORMULA . This complete the proof.    FORMULA FORMULA
What Theorem REF  implies, in particular, is that
in a 3-restricted minimal criminal FORMULA ,
each configuration FORMULA  of FORMULA  and its parent FORMULA , where FORMULA  is
1-ss, is itself induced by a
5-cycle on the vertices FORMULA  in a clockwise order,
and is of one of the following
three types (note that if FORMULA  has a sibling FORMULA , then it is unique and we assume
FORMULA  to be the right of FORMULA  in the planar embedding of FORMULA  when viewed from FORMULA ):
(a)
FORMULA  is the 5-cycle on FORMULA 
in which FORMULA  is connected to FORMULA . Here FORMULA  is bounded by FORMULA 
and FORMULA  is bounded by FORMULA .
(b)
FORMULA  is the 5-cycle on FORMULA 
in which FORMULA  is connected to FORMULA . Here FORMULA  is bounded by FORMULA 
and FORMULA  is bounded by FORMULA .
(c)
FORMULA  is the 5-cycle on FORMULA 
in which FORMULA  is connected to both FORMULA  and FORMULA . Here FORMULA  is bounded by FORMULA ,
the face FORMULA  is bounded by FORMULA  and FORMULA  is bounded by FORMULA .

Here, for all the three types of configurations, it is assumed that
the edge FORMULA  bounds the face FORMULA  as well as FORMULA .
Remarks:
Note that as plane configurations (a) and (b) are mirror images of each other.
Also, note that in all configurations, all the edges FORMULA  where FORMULA 
of the 5-cycle that induces FORMULA , except one edge FORMULA ,
bound the infinite face of FORMULA .

Convention:
Let FORMULA  be a 3-restricted biconnected outerplanar graph with FORMULA 
such that for each 1-ss face FORMULA  of FORMULA  the
configuration of FORMULA  and its parent FORMULA  is of type (a), (b) or (c) from
above. Call such a FORMULA  fully restricted.
Hence, a minimal criminal is always fully restricted.
Let FORMULA  be a biconnected outerplanar graph induced by the cycle FORMULA  on
the vertices FORMULA  in clockwise order. Assume that
FORMULA  and that FORMULA  is adjacent to FORMULA  and FORMULA .
From FORMULA  we construct four other outerplanar graphs FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  in the
following way:

Let FORMULA  be obtained by replacing the edge FORMULA 
by the 2-path FORMULA .

Let FORMULA  be obtained from FORMULA  by replacing the edges FORMULA 
and FORMULA  by the 2-paths FORMULA  and FORMULA 
respectively.

Let FORMULA  be obtained from FORMULA  by replacing the edge FORMULA 
by the 2-path FORMULA  and connecting the additional vertex FORMULA 
to both FORMULA  and FORMULA .

Let FORMULA  be obtained from FORMULA  by connecting the additional
vertex FORMULA  to both FORMULA  and FORMULA  and the additional vertex FORMULA  to FORMULA  and FORMULA .

Note that FORMULA  is a contraction of each of the graphs FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
namely
FORMULA 
Lemma 6.6 
A 7-coloring of FORMULA  can be extended to a 7-coloring of FORMULA .

Proof. 
Since FORMULA  induces
a clique in FORMULA , we may assume FORMULA  to have color FORMULA  for
FORMULA  in the 7-coloring of FORMULA . To obtain a 7-coloring of FORMULA 
we retain the colors of FORMULA  from FORMULA  for all FORMULA  and
then assign colors FORMULA  to vertices FORMULA  respectively
(note that we do not need to know the colors
of all the neighbors of neither FORMULA  nor FORMULA  in the given 7-coloring of FORMULA ).    FORMULA FORMULA
Convention:
Let FORMULA  be a biconnected outerplanar graph FORMULA  with FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be a degree-two vertex of FORMULA  that bounds a leaf-face FORMULA 
of FORMULA . If FORMULA  is provided with a 7-coloring,
call FORMULA  c-simplicial if all the neighbors of FORMULA  in FORMULA 
have collectively FORMULA  colors.
Note that FORMULA  from above cannot be a minimal criminal, since FORMULA 
is c-simplicial; if we have a 7-coloring of FORMULA  then we
can extend it to a 7-coloring of FORMULA .
Our next theorem will provide our main tool for this section.
Theorem 6.7 
If FORMULA  and the constructed graphs FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  are as defined above,
then none of the graphs FORMULA , FORMULA  or FORMULA  are minimal criminals.

Proof. 
If FORMULA  is a minimal criminal, then by definition FORMULA  has a legitimate 7-coloring.
Again, we may assume FORMULA  to have color FORMULA  for FORMULA .
By retaining the colors of FORMULA  from FORMULA  for FORMULA 
and then assigning colors FORMULA  to the vertices FORMULA 
respectively, we obtain a legitimate 7-coloring of FORMULA .
Hence, FORMULA  cannot be a minimal criminal.
If FORMULA  is a minimal criminal, then FORMULA  has a legitimate 7-coloring.
We can assume FORMULA  to have color FORMULA  for FORMULA .
By Lemma REF  we obtain a 7 coloring of FORMULA ,
as given in its proof. If FORMULA  is c-simplicial (w.r.t. this mentioned 7-coloring of FORMULA )
then we can obtain a 7-coloring of FORMULA . Therefore FORMULA  cannot be c-simplicial
in this case. This means the neighbors of FORMULA  among FORMULA 
have the colors FORMULA  and 5 precisely, since FORMULA  and FORMULA .
In this case assign the colors FORMULA  to the vertices FORMULA .
This is a legitimate 7-coloring of FORMULA 
and hence FORMULA  cannot be a minimal criminal.
If FORMULA  is a minimal criminal, then then FORMULA  has a legitimate 7-coloring.
We can assume FORMULA  to have color FORMULA  for FORMULA . If both FORMULA  and FORMULA 
are c-simplicial, then we can extend the given coloring of FORMULA  to that of FORMULA ,
since FORMULA  and FORMULA  are of distance 3 or more from each other in FORMULA . If neither
FORMULA  nor FORMULA  are c-simplicial, then we must have that the neighbors of FORMULA  among
FORMULA  have the colors FORMULA  and 7 precisely,
and the neighbors of FORMULA  among FORMULA 
have the colors FORMULA  and 3 precisely. In this case we assign the colors
colors FORMULA  to the vertices FORMULA 
respectively (as in the case with FORMULA ) and obtain a legitimate 7-coloring of FORMULA .
We consider lastly the case where one of FORMULA  and FORMULA  is c-simplicial and the other is not.
By symmetry, it suffices to consider the case where FORMULA  is c-simplicial and FORMULA  is not.
The fact that FORMULA  is c-simplicial means that it can be assigned a color that must be from
FORMULA  and thereby obtain a 7-coloring of FORMULA . Since FORMULA  is not
c-simplicial means that the neighbors of FORMULA  among FORMULA 
have the colors FORMULA  and 3 precisely. We now consider the following three
cases:
FORMULA  has color 5: In this case assign the colors
FORMULA  to the vertices FORMULA , thereby obtaining a legitimate
7-coloring of FORMULA .
FORMULA  has color 6: In this case assign the colors
FORMULA  to the vertices FORMULA , thereby obtaining a legitimate
7-coloring of FORMULA .
FORMULA  has color 7: Here FORMULA  and FORMULA  cannot be connected since
both FORMULA  and FORMULA  have color 7. In this case assign the colors
FORMULA  to the vertices FORMULA , thereby obtaining a legitimate
7-coloring of FORMULA .
This shows that FORMULA  cannot be a minimal criminal. This completes our proof.    FORMULA FORMULA
Remark: To test the legitimacy of the extended colorings we note
first of all that the vertices FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  always keep their
color from the one provided by FORMULA . In addition, the colors of the
neighbors of FORMULA  among FORMULA  are the same, unless FORMULA 
is not c-simplicial, which gives concrete information about the colors
of the other neighbors of FORMULA . Similarly the colors of the neighbors of FORMULA 
among FORMULA  are the same, unless (as for FORMULA )
FORMULA  is not c-simplicial, which again gives concrete information about the
colors of the remaining neighbors of FORMULA .

We are now ready for the proof of the following main result of this section.
Theorem 6.8 
There is no minimal criminal; every biconnected outerplanar graph FORMULA  with
FORMULA  has FORMULA .

Proof. 
We will show that a minimal criminal must have the form of one of the
graphs FORMULA , FORMULA  or FORMULA , thereby obtaining a contradiction by
Theorem REF .
Assume FORMULA  is a minimal criminal, which must therefore be fully restricted.
Since FORMULA , each 1-ss face FORMULA  of FORMULA  has a
parent FORMULA  and a grandparent FORMULA  in FORMULA . Hence, FORMULA  (that is FORMULA )
is a leaf in FORMULA  (or a single vertex). Since FORMULA  is fully
restricted, the configuration FORMULA  in FORMULA  is induced by a 5-cycle
on vertices FORMULA  in clockwise order and is of type (a), (b) or (c)
mentioned earlier. Assume FORMULA  is bounded by FORMULA 
where FORMULA . If FORMULA  (that is FORMULA ) is not a single vertex but a leaf in
FORMULA , then let the edge FORMULA  of FORMULA  be the dual edge
of the unique edge with FORMULA  as and endvertex in FORMULA .
In any case (whether FORMULA  is a leaf or a single vertex in FORMULA )
at least one of the edges FORMULA  must be
identified with an edge FORMULA  of a configuration FORMULA 
of type (a), (b) or (c).
If there is an edge FORMULA  bounding FORMULA  and a configuration
FORMULA  in such a way that the edge FORMULA  is identified with
FORMULA  (i.e. FORMULA  and FORMULA ) and such
that either FORMULA  or FORMULA , then either the degree-two
vertices FORMULA  or FORMULA  has FORMULA  neighbors in FORMULA  respectively.
this means that a 7-coloring of either FORMULA  or FORMULA  can
be used to extend to a 7-coloring of FORMULA . Therefore FORMULA  cannot be a minimal
criminal in this case.
We note that in order for FORMULA  for all configurations
FORMULA , then every edge FORMULA  for FORMULA  must
be identified with an edge FORMULA  of a configuration FORMULA .
That is to say, none of the edges FORMULA  can bound the infinite
face of FORMULA . Since FORMULA  we must, in particular, have that
the edges FORMULA  and FORMULA  must be identified
with edges FORMULA  of configurations FORMULA  each of type
(a), (b) or (c). If FORMULA , then (as mentioned in previous
paragraph) both configurations, to the left and right of FORMULA  in the
plane embedding of FORMULA , contain a degree-two vertex with FORMULA 
neighbors in FORMULA . In order for FORMULA  then the FORMULA 
configuration to the left of FORMULA  in FORMULA , must be of type (b) or (c)
and the configuration FORMULA  to the right of FORMULA  must be of
type (a) or (c). We now finally discuss these cases separately.
Here “Case (x,y)” will mean that configuration FORMULA  of type
(x) is to the left of FORMULA  and configuration FORMULA  of type (y)
is to the right of FORMULA .
Case (b,a): Here FORMULA  is of type FORMULA  as stated in
Theorem REF  (with FORMULA  in the role of FORMULA  mentioned
there), and therefore cannot be a minimal criminal.
Case (b,c): Here FORMULA  is of type FORMULA  as stated in
Theorem REF , and therefore cannot be a minimal criminal.
Case (c,a): Here FORMULA  is a mirror image of a type FORMULA  (previous case)
as stated in Theorem REF ,
and therefore cannot be a minimal criminal.
Case (c,c): Here FORMULA  is of type FORMULA  as stated in
Theorem REF , and therefore cannot be a minimal criminal.
This concludes the proof, that there is no minimal criminal, and hence
the square of each biconnected outerplanar graph with FORMULA  is 7-colorable.    FORMULA FORMULA
By Theorem REF  and Lemma REF  we have the following corollary.
Corollary 6.9 
For every outerplanar graph FORMULA  with FORMULA  we have FORMULA .

Greedy is not exact
We have observed that Greedy yields an optimal for coloring squares of
outerplanar graphs whenever FORMULA  or FORMULA .
On many of the examples that we have constructed it also gives optimal
colorings. It is therefore a natural question to ask whether it always
obtains an optimal coloring. If not, one may ask for the case of
chordal graphs, where we have seen that Greedy is also optimal for FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Further evidence may be gathered by observing that it yields optimal
colorings of FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA , since their squares are chordal.
We answer these questions in the negative by showing that the chordal
graph FORMULA  is a counterexample.
Theorem 6.10 Greedy does not always output an optimal coloring of FORMULA .

Proof. 
Suppose that the vertices of (REF ) in Figure REF 
are ordered
so that first come the white vertices in the order shown on the figure
(either from left-to-right or in a circular order). Then, Greedy will
first color the white vertices with the first two colors. Now, the
remaining six vertices must receive different colors, and none of them
can use the first two colors, resulting in an 8-coloring.    FORMULA FORMULA
