We apply the entropy function formalism to non-extremal FORMULA  and FORMULA -branes
whose throat approximation is given by the Schwarzschild black hole in
FORMULA  and FORMULA , respectively.
We find the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and the FORMULA  corrections
from the value of the entropy function at its saddle point. While the higher derivative
terms have no effect on the temperature, they decrease the value of the entropy.
Introduction
The black hole attractor mechanism has been an active subject over the past
few years in string theory. This is originated from the observation that there
is a connection between the partition function of four-dimensional BPS black
holes and partition function of topological strings {{cite:82a77757-6f04-4a4d-b186-9b5c1f21a58d}}.
This mechanism states that in the extremal black hole backgrounds
the moduli scalar fields at horizon are determined by the charge of black
hole and are independent of their asymptotic values.
One may study the attractor mechanism by finding the effective
potential for the moduli fields and examining the behavior of the effective
potential at its extremum. This extremum should be a local minimum for extremal
black holes. The entropy of black hole is
then given by the value of the effective potential at its minimum. Using
this, the entropy of some extremal black holes has been calculated in {{cite:7e8d4d40-d410-42bc-9124-02357dc1d98b}}.
Recently, it has been proposed by A. Sen that
the entropy of a specific class of extremal black holes in higher derivative
gravity can be calculated using the entropy function formalism {{cite:72b59705-604b-43ac-8032-9613f9020e32}}.
According to this formalism, the entropy function for the black holes that
their near horizon is FORMULA  is defined by integrating the
Lagrangian density over FORMULA  for a general FORMULA 
background characterized by the size of FORMULA  and FORMULA , and taking
the Legendre transform of the resulting function with respect to the
parameters labeling the electric fields. The result is a function of
moduli scalar fields as well as the sizes of FORMULA  and FORMULA . The
values of moduli fields and the sizes are determined by extremizing
the entropy function with respect to the moduli fields
and the sizes. Moreover, the entropy is given by
the value of the entropy function at the extremumIt is assumed
that in the presence of higher derivative terms there is a solution whose near
horizon geometry is FORMULA . In the cases that the higher
derivative corrections modify the solution such that the near horizon is
not FORMULA  anymore, one cannot use the entropy function formalism.
In those cases one may use the Wald formula {{cite:eacdab31-3ff5-4758-a012-3a50edabfc94}} to calculated the
entropy directly.. Using this method the entropy of some extremal black
holes have been found in {{cite:72b59705-604b-43ac-8032-9613f9020e32}},{{cite:fdb960ef-01c9-4ec5-8f87-61d1d07cd912}},{{cite:bacbcae2-664c-4026-9a62-52335ac6d93d}}.
The above discussion does not indicate that the entropy function should have
local minimum at the near horizon. In fact, it has been shown in {{cite:4afca75a-23fd-4dff-89a8-c686120dada1}}
that the entropy function has a saddle point at the near horizon of extremal
black holes. One may then conclude that the entropy function formalism should
not be something specific for the extremal black holes. Indeed, it has been
shown in {{cite:b0c6f156-2900-4d92-adbf-0f50f8251330}}, {{cite:4afca75a-23fd-4dff-89a8-c686120dada1}} that the entropy function formalism works for
some non-extremal black hole/branes at the supergravity level. It has been
speculated in {{cite:4afca75a-23fd-4dff-89a8-c686120dada1}} that the entropy function formalism works for the
non-extremal black holes/branes whose near horizons are some extension of FORMULA 
space, e.g., Schwarzschild black hole in FORMULA .
The non-extremal black branes that have been studied in {{cite:4afca75a-23fd-4dff-89a8-c686120dada1}}
are FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA -branes whose near horizon geometries are Schwarzschild
black hole in FORMULA  where FORMULA  and 5, respectively. When higher
derivative corrections are included, however, the near horizon geometry is
not the Schwarzschild black hole in FORMULA  anymore. Consequently, the
entropy function formalism does not work for these cases when one considers
the higher derivative terms.
In this paper, we would like to study the non-extremal black hole/brane solutions
that the higher derivative terms respect the symmetry of the tree level solutions.
Consider the non-extremal FORMULA  and FORMULA -branes. The near horizon (throat
approximation) of their tree level geometries are the Schwarzschild black hole
in FORMULA . Moreover, in these cases, the higher derivative terms of the effective
action respect the symmetry of the supergravity solution. In fact, the Schwarzschild
black hole in FORMULA  is the BTZ black hole {{cite:b2a5cb6d-d2d7-4c33-bfc0-66ebb78621be}} in which the inner horizon
FORMULA . On the other hand, it is known that the BTZ black hole is an exact
solution of the string theory {{cite:f158bee9-be50-4ff8-ade8-9057c4efb50a}}. So one expects that the entropy function
formalism works for the non-extremal FORMULA  and FORMULA -branes even in the
presence of the higher derivative terms.
An outline of the paper is as follows. In section 2, we review the non-extremal
FORMULA  and FORMULA  solutions of the effective action of type II string theory.
In sections 3, using the entropy function formalism we derive the Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy of FORMULA -branes in terms of the temperature of black branes. We show that the entropy
is given by the entropy function at its saddle point. In subsection 3.1 we show
that the higher derivative terms respect the symmetries of the solution at the
tree level and the entropy function formalism works in the presence of the
higher derivative terms. Using this we find the entropy as the saddle point
of the entropy function. As a double check, we also calculate the entropy
using the Wald formula directly and find exact agreement with the result
from the entropy function formalism. In section 4, we repeat the calculations
for FORMULA -branes. We shall show that, in both cases, the higher derivative
terms do not modify the tree level temperature, however, the entropy decreases
with respect to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.

Review of the non-extremal solutions
In this section we review the non-extremal FORMULA  and FORMULA -branes solutions
of the effective action of type II string theory. The two-derivatives effective
action in the string frame is given by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the dilaton, FORMULA  is NS-NS 3-form field
strength, and FORMULA  is the electric R-R n-form field strength where
FORMULA  for IIB and FORMULA  for type IIA theory. In above equation, dots
represent fermionic terms in which we are not interested. The effective action
includes a Chern-Simons term which is zero for the FORMULA  and FORMULA  solutions. Moreover, for these solutions FORMULA .
The 5-form field
strength tensor is self-dual, hence, it is not described by the
above simple action. It is sufficient to adopt the
above action for deriving the equations of motion, and impose the
self-duality by hand.
The non-extremal FORMULA -branes solution of the IIB effective action when
FORMULA -branes are along the compact FORMULA  direction FORMULA  and FORMULA -branes along the compact FORMULA  directions FORMULA  is given
by the following, (see e.g. {{cite:dbf5df6c-8c1c-449b-b435-9ade81e1c782}}):
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
The above solution is the D1D5P solution {{cite:dbf5df6c-8c1c-449b-b435-9ade81e1c782}}, {{cite:89fa6858-9170-4e58-b861-77e11188f160}} in which the amount of left and right moving momenta, propagating in the compact direction FORMULA , is chosen to be equal, i.e., FORMULA  in the notation {{cite:89fa6858-9170-4e58-b861-77e11188f160}}.
For FORMULA  we obtain the extremal solution, depending on the two
parameters FORMULA  and FORMULA  which are related to the number of FORMULA -branes.
For FORMULA  a horizon develops at FORMULA . The near horizon geometry which
is described by a throat,
can be found by using the throat approximation where FORMULA  and FORMULA .
In these limits the non-extremal solution becomes
FORMULA 
The geometry is the product of FORMULA  with the Schwarzschild
black hole in FORMULA .
The non-extremal FORMULA -branes solution of the IIA effective action
when FORMULA -branes are along the compact FORMULA  directions FORMULA , FORMULA -branes along the compact FORMULA  directions FORMULA 
and FORMULA -branes along the compact FORMULA  directions FORMULA  is given by the following
(see e.g. {{cite:90e1f3b1-1948-4941-bfd8-1ecb9ff86e16}}):
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
The above solution is the D2D6NS5P solution {{cite:90e1f3b1-1948-4941-bfd8-1ecb9ff86e16}}, {{cite:89fa6858-9170-4e58-b861-77e11188f160}} in which the amount of left and right moving momenta, propagating in the compact direction FORMULA , is chosen to be equal, i.e., FORMULA  in the notation {{cite:89fa6858-9170-4e58-b861-77e11188f160}}.
For FORMULA  one obtains the extremal solution by sending
FORMULA  such that FORMULA 
is kept fixed. The extremal solution then depends on the three
parameters FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  which are related to the number of
FORMULA -branes.
For FORMULA  a horizon develops at FORMULA . The near horizon geometry
which is described by a throat
can be found by using the throat approximation where FORMULA  and
FORMULA .
In this limit FORMULA  and the non-extremal
solution becomes
FORMULA 
where we have made also the coordinate transformations
FORMULA . The above geometry is now
the product of FORMULA  with the Schwarzschild black hole in FORMULA .

Entropy function for non-extremal FORMULA -branes
Following {{cite:72b59705-604b-43ac-8032-9613f9020e32}}, in order to apply the entropy function formalism to the non-extremal
FORMULA -branes one should deform the near horizon geometry (REF ) to the most general form which is the product of the FORMULA -Schwarzchild and FORMULA  space, that is
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  are supposed to be constants, otherwise the above geometry is not product space. The electric field strengths
are deformed such that the electric charges are remaining fixed. The function FORMULA  is
defined to be the integral of the Lagrangian density over the
horizon FORMULA .
The result of inserting the background of (REF ) into FORMULA  is
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the volume of FORMULA , FORMULA  is the volume of the 3-sphere with radius one,
and FORMULA  is the FORMULA  volume. The electric charges are carried by the
branes and are given by
FORMULA 
Note that the electric charges are independent of the scales
FORMULA  and FORMULA  as expected, i.e.,
FORMULA 
Following {{cite:72b59705-604b-43ac-8032-9613f9020e32}}, for FORMULA  space, one defins the entropy function as the Legendre transform of FORMULA 
with respect to the electric fields FORMULA  and FORMULA . Extending that definition to our case which is FORMULA  space, we define the entropy function by taking the Legendre transform of FORMULA 
with respect to the electric fields FORMULA  and FORMULA , and dividing the result by FORMULA , that isFor FORMULA  space, one should divide the Legendre transform of FORMULA  by FORMULA  to define the entropy function in FORMULA  space.
FORMULA 
where we have substituted the values of FORMULA  and FORMULA  from (REF ). Note that we have already assumed that FORMULA  and FORMULA  are independent of FORMULA , that is, FORMULA  and FORMULA  are not appeared in the Lagrangian. Hence, diving the Legendre transform of FORMULA  by FORMULA  does not change the equations of motionAn alternative way to deal with the FORMULA  space is to dimensionally reduce it to FORMULA  space and then use the entropy function formalism of the FORMULA  space {{cite:02d26c3b-23f7-4254-b2d2-f5fac4434dcb}}.. Solving the equations of motion
FORMULA 
one finds the following solution
FORMULA 
This confirms that (REF ) is a solution of the type IIB supergravity action.
Let us now consider the behavior of the entropy function around the
above critical point. To this end, consider the following matrix
FORMULA 
Ignoring the overall factor, the eigenvalues of this matrix are FORMULA .
This shows that the above critical point is a saddle point of the entropy function.
It is a general property of the entropy function for both extremal and
non-extremal cases {{cite:4afca75a-23fd-4dff-89a8-c686120dada1}}.
Let us now return to the entropy associated with this solution.
It is straightforward to find the entropy from the Wald formula {{cite:eacdab31-3ff5-4758-a012-3a50edabfc94}}
FORMULA 
For this background we have FORMULA 
and FORMULA .
These simplify the entropy relation to
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is an expression similar to FORMULA 
except that each FORMULA  Riemann tensor component is scaled by a factor of FORMULA .
To find FORMULA  using the prescription given
in {{cite:72b59705-604b-43ac-8032-9613f9020e32}} and {{cite:fdb960ef-01c9-4ec5-8f87-61d1d07cd912}},
we note that in addition to FORMULA , the Riemann tensor components FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are proportional to FORMULA , i.e.,
FORMULA 
Hence, one should rescale them too. We use the following scaling for these components
FORMULA 
Now, FORMULA  must be of the form FORMULA  for some function FORMULA .
Then one can show that the following relation holds for FORMULA  and its derivatives
with respect to scales, FORMULA  and FORMULA :
FORMULA 
In addition, there is a relation between the rescaled Riemann tensor
components at the supergravity level, which can be found by using (REF )
FORMULA 
Replacing the above relation into (REF ) and using the equations of
motion, one finds that FORMULA . It is easy to see that the entropy
is proportional to the entropy function up to a constant coefficient, i.e.,
FORMULA 
This is the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. One may write the entropy in terms
of the temperature of black brane. The relation between FORMULA  and temperature can be read
from the metric. The surface gravity is given by
FORMULA 
which in our case we find FORMULA . Note that the constant FORMULA  is canceled in the above surface gravity. This causes that the higher derivative terms which modifies FORMULA  have no effect on the temperature. The entropy in terms of temperature becomes
FORMULA 
where we have used the relations FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , and
FORMULA  where FORMULA  is the number of
D1-branes and FORMULA  is the number of D5-branes {{cite:fdb960ef-01c9-4ec5-8f87-61d1d07cd912}}. Alternatively, one may write the entropy in terms of the number of left moving or right moving momenta. Note that for our case FORMULA . The relation between FORMULA  and FORMULA  is given as
FORMULA 
where we have set FORMULA  in the relations for FORMULA  and FORMULA  in {{cite:89fa6858-9170-4e58-b861-77e11188f160}}. In terms of FORMULA , the entropy (REF ) becomes
FORMULA 
Note that for two charges extremal black hole, FORMULA , i.e., FORMULA , the entropy function is exactly
the same as the non-extremal case but the value of the entropy is zero.
We have seen that the entropy function works despite the fact that the
horizon is not attractive. To see more explicitly that the horizon here
is not attractive, we use the intuitional explanation for attractor mechanism
given in {{cite:ae3c3319-5d90-4714-9fcd-4859f3676aa8}}. According to this, the physical distance
from an arbitrary point to the attractive horizon is infinite. The proper
distance of an arbitrary point from the horizon in our case is
FORMULA 
which is finite (infinite) for the non-extremal (extremal) case.
Higher derivative terms 
In the previous sections we have seen that the entropy function formalism
works at two derivatives level. It will be interesting to consider stringy
effects and take a look at the entropy function mechanism again. To this
end, we consider the higher derivative corrections coming from string theory.
To next leading order the Lagrangian of type II theory is given by {{cite:eaf247cc-038d-440a-a28c-568bcfceeb13}}
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  can be written in terms
of the Weyl tensors
FORMULA 
Following {{cite:72b59705-604b-43ac-8032-9613f9020e32}}, we consider the general background consist of FORMULA -Schwarzchild times FORMULA  space (REF ) in the presence of the higher derivative terms. As we shall see shortly, the higher derivative terms respect the symmetry of the tree level solution, i.e., the coefficients FORMULA  and FORMULA  remain constant. To see this we calculate the contribution of the above higher
derivative terms to the entropy functionNote that for FORMULA  with identical radii, the Weyl tensor is zero as noted in {{cite:6d3a0ff4-f016-49cc-aef9-330c0d46e7f3}}. However, this tensor is non-vanishing for the space FORMULA  in which we are interested in 10-dimensional space-time.
FORMULA 
It is important to note that FORMULA  is independent of FORMULA . This is consistent with our assumption that FORMULA  and FORMULA  are constants. By variation of FORMULA  with respect to FORMULA  and FORMULA  one
finds the equations of motion. Since these equations are valid only up
to first order of FORMULA , we consider the following perturbative
solutions:
FORMULA 
One should replace them into the equations of motion, i.e.,
FORMULA 
these equations are consistent and give the following results:
FORMULA 
It is interesting to note that the stringy effect decreases the closed
string coupling at the near horizon, i.e., FORMULA .
Similar behavior appears for the non-extremal FORMULA -branes {{cite:6d3a0ff4-f016-49cc-aef9-330c0d46e7f3}}.
Let us now return to the entropy associated with this solution. The entropy is given by
FORMULA 
where we have used the fact that all the steps toward writing the Wald
formula (REF ) for entropy in terms of the above entropy function
remain unchanged. In particular the relation (REF ) holds in the presence
of the higher derivative terms. It turns out, in order to find the entropy to linear order of FORMULA , one
does not need to know the values of FORMULA , and FORMULA . To see this, note
that if one replaces (REF ) into the first term above, one finds
that FORMULA , and FORMULA  do not appear in this term linearly. The second term has
an overall factor of FORMULA , hence to the linear order of FORMULA , one
has to replace FORMULA  into it. The result is
FORMULA 
As a double check, we calculate the entropy using the ward
formula (REF ) directly, i.e.,
FORMULA 
where the function FORMULA  is given by
FORMULA 
This second term is proportional to FORMULA , so to the first order of
FORMULA  one has to replace the Schwarzschild FORMULA  solution (REF )
in FORMULA  which gives
FORMULA 
For the first term, on the other hand, one has to replace (REF ) which gives
FORMULA 
Now inserting the solution (REF ) for FORMULA  and FORMULA  into the above equation,
one finds exactly the result (REF ).
To write the entropy in terms of the temperature, we note that FORMULA  appears
as an overall factor of FORMULA  in the background (REF ), hence, the
temperature (REF ) remains the same as the tree level temperature, i.e., FORMULA . This
is unlike the temperature of non-extremal FORMULA -branes that stringy effects
increase the tree level temperature.
The entropy of FORMULA -branes
in terms of temperature or in terms of FORMULA  is
FORMULA 
In the second line, we have used the fact that the higher derivative corrections do not change the Hawking temperature which means the number of
excitations for the left and right moving momenta remain the same as the tree level result. Note that the leading FORMULA  correction makes the entropy decreases.

Entropy function for non-extremal FORMULA -branes
Following {{cite:72b59705-604b-43ac-8032-9613f9020e32}}, in order to apply the entropy function formalism to the non-extremal
FORMULA -branes one should deform the near horizon geometry (REF ) to the most general form which is the product of the FORMULA -Schwarzchild and FORMULA  space, that is
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  are supposed to be constants. The electric field strength
is deformed such that the corresponding electric charge remains fixed. Similarly,
to have the fixed magnetic charges, one does not need to deform the
magnetic field strength.
The function FORMULA  is defined to be the integral of the Lagrangian density over
the horizon FORMULA .
The result of inserting the background (REF ) into FORMULA  is
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the volume of FORMULA , FORMULA  is the volume of the 2-sphere with radius one,
and FORMULA  is the FORMULA  volume. The electric charge carried by the FORMULA -brane
is given by
FORMULA 
Note that the electric charge is independent of the scales FORMULA  as expected, i.e.,
FORMULA 
Now we define the entropy function by taking the Legendre transform of FORMULA 
with respect to the electric field FORMULA , and dividing by FORMULA , that is
FORMULA 
where we have substituted the value of FORMULA .
Solving the equations of motion
FORMULA 
one finds the following solutions
FORMULA 
This confirms that (REF ) is a solution of the type IIA supergravity action.
To find the behavior of the entropy function around the above critical point,
consider again the matrix (REF ).
Ignoring the overall factor, the eigenvalues of this matrix are FORMULA .
This shows again that the above critical point is a saddle point of the entropy function.
Let us now return to the entropy associated with this solution.
The Wald formula {{cite:eacdab31-3ff5-4758-a012-3a50edabfc94}} is given by
FORMULA 
For this background we have FORMULA  and FORMULA .
These simplify the entropy relation to
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is an expression similar to FORMULA 
except that each FORMULA  Riemann
tensor component is scaled by a factor of FORMULA .
To find FORMULA ,
we note that in addition to FORMULA , the Riemann
tensor components FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are proportional to FORMULA , i.e.,
FORMULA 
Hence, one should also rescale these components. We use the following scaling
FORMULA 
Now we see that FORMULA  must be of the form FORMULA  for some function FORMULA .
Then one can show that the following relation holds for FORMULA  and its
derivatives with respect to scales, FORMULA  and  FORMULA
FORMULA 
As in the FORMULA  case, by using the equation (REF ) one finds the
same relation as (REF )
between the rescaled Riemann tensor components at the supergravity level.
Replacing (REF ) into (REF ) and using the equations of
motion, one finds again FORMULA . Hence, the entropy is
proportional to the entropy function up to a constant coefficient, i.e.,
FORMULA 
This is the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. One may write the entropy
in terms of temperature. An alternative way to find temperature is to impose regularity of Euclidean metric near the horizon. So consider
the proper distance of an arbitrary point from the horizon, i.e.,
FORMULA 
Near FORMULA , one finds FORMULA . So
the metric (REF ) near FORMULA  becomes
FORMULA 
The period of the Euclidean time, required by the regularity of
metric is FORMULA . Note that here also the constant FORMULA  does not appear in the above metric, so the temperature is independent of the value of FORMULA . The
entropy in terms of the temperature is
FORMULA 
where in the last expression we have used
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA . Alternatively, one may write the entropy in terms of the number of left moving or right moving momenta where in our case FORMULA . The relation between FORMULA  and FORMULA  is given as
FORMULA 
where we have set FORMULA  in the relations for FORMULA  and FORMULA  in {{cite:89fa6858-9170-4e58-b861-77e11188f160}}, and used the rescaling FORMULA , FORMULA . In terms of FORMULA , the entropy (REF ) becomes
FORMULA 
which is in the conventional form appearing in {{cite:89fa6858-9170-4e58-b861-77e11188f160}}.
Higher derivative terms 
We now consider the general background consist of FORMULA -Schwarzchild times FORMULA  space (REF ) in the presence of the higher derivative terms. The higher derivative terms respect the symmetry of the tree level solution, i.e., the coefficients FORMULA  and FORMULA  remain constant. To see this we calculate the contribution of the above higher
derivative terms to the entropy function i.e.,
FORMULA 
By variation of FORMULA  with respect to FORMULA  and FORMULA  one
finds the equations of motion. Considering the perturbative
solutions (REF ), one finds
FORMULA 
these equations are consistent, and give the following results
FORMULA 
Similar to the FORMULA  case, the stringy effects decrease the
closed string coupling at the near horizon.
Let us return to the entropy associated with this solution. The entropy is given by
FORMULA 
where again we have used the fact that all the steps toward writing the Wald formula
for the entropy in terms of the entropy function above, remain unchanged.
In this case also, in order to find the entropy to linear order of FORMULA , one does not need to know the solutions
for FORMULA  and FORMULA . That is, if one replaces (REF ) into the tree level entropy
function, i.e., the first term above, one finds that FORMULA , and FORMULA  do not appear in it linearly.
The second term, on the other hand, has an overall factor of FORMULA , hence to
linear order of FORMULA , one has to replace FORMULA  into it. The result is
FORMULA 
As a double check, we calculate the entropy using the ward formula
(REF ) directly, i.e.,
FORMULA 
The second term is proportional to FORMULA , so to the first order
of FORMULA  one has to replace the Schwarzschild FORMULA  solution (REF )
in FORMULA  which gives
FORMULA 
For the first term, one has to replace (REF ) which gives
FORMULA 
Now inserting the solutions for FORMULA  and FORMULA  into the above equation,
one finds exactly the result (REF ).
The entropy (REF ) in terms of temperature is
FORMULA 
This entropy, like the entropy of the FORMULA -branes, is less than the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. This is unlike the entropy of the non-extremal
FORMULA -branes {{cite:6d3a0ff4-f016-49cc-aef9-330c0d46e7f3}} which is FORMULA , where the
first term is the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and the second term which is the FORMULA  correction, is positive.
The increase in the entropy for FORMULA -branes is consistent with the fact that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy at strong 't Hooft coupling is less than the entropy of FORMULA  SYM theory at zero coupling by a factor of FORMULA  {{cite:30c2ae94-8bd6-4331-8a14-f8f3b5bcb627}}. On the other hand, the correction to the entropy at weak coupling is negative {{cite:89fc75a9-ee0c-433d-9665-223cbddc6d90}} which is an indication of smooth interpolation between the weak and strong coupling regimes. For FORMULA -branes, our result indicates that the correction to the entropy at strong coupling is negative. On the other hand, it is known that the entropy at zero coupling is the same as the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy at strong coupling {{cite:da652d76-596e-4d2e-af95-bd973eaf9bc2}}. This indicates that the correction to the entropy at weak coupling should be non-vanishing too. Assuming the interpolating function between the strong and the weak coupling regimes of the Higgs branch of the FORMULA  SYM at finite temperature in FORMULA  dimensions does not cross the zeroth order entropy at any point in finite coupling, one expects the correction to the entropy at weak coupling to be negative. It would be interesting to perform this calculation.
