Strong confidence intervals for autoregressionVladimir Vovkvovk@cs.rhul.ac.ukhttp://vovk.net2020/09/07 15:50:29In this short preliminary note
I apply the methodology of game-theoretic probability
to calculating non-asymptotic confidence intervals
for the coefficient of a simple first order scalar autoregressive model.
The most distinctive feature of the proposed procedure
is that with high probability it produces confidence intervals
that always cover the true parameter value
when applied sequentially.
Introduction
Game-theoretic probability
(see, e.g., {{cite:36c920b1-5e37-4268-acaf-45c7c4fa4451}},
with the basic idea going back to Ville {{cite:406c73e4-d158-4009-8cb1-c9f465118481}})
provides a means of testing probabilistic models.
In this note the game-theoretic methodology
is extended to statistical models;
it will be demonstrated on the first-order scalar autoregressive model
FORMULA 
without the intercept term,
with constant FORMULA ,
and with independent FORMULA  innovations FORMULA .
We will be interested in procedures for computing,
for each FORMULA ,
a confidence interval FORMULA  for FORMULA 
given FORMULA .
Let us fix a confidence level FORMULA ,
and let FORMULA  be the true parameter value.
The usual procedures are “batch”,
in that they only guarantee
that FORMULA  with high probability
for a fixed FORMULA .
It is usually true that,
when they are applied sequentially,
the intersection FORMULA  is empty with probability one.
Our goal is to guarantee that
FORMULA 
with probability at least FORMULA .
Analogously to the usual classification of the limit theorems of probability theory
into “strong” (involving the conjunction over all FORMULA )
and “weak” (applicable to individual FORMULA ),
let us call such confidence intervals strong.
In particular,
confidence intervals satisfying (REF )
with probability at least FORMULA 
will be called strong FORMULA -confidence intervals.
Accordingly, confidence intervals produced by the standard procedures
will be referred to as weak;
weak FORMULA -confidence intervals
satisfy FORMULA  with probability at least FORMULA 
for each individual FORMULA .
(This probability is sometimes required to be precisely FORMULA ,
but we will only consider the “conservative” definitions.)
To achieve the goal (REF ),
for each possible value of the parameter FORMULA 
we construct random variables FORMULA ,
FORMULA ,
that form a nonnegative martingale
under the probability measure FORMULA 
corresponding to the probabilistic model (REF )
with the given FORMULA .
It will also be true that FORMULA ;
such sequences (nonnegative martingales starting from 1)
will be called martingale tests.
We can then set
FORMULA 
(assuming that the set on the right-hand side is an interval,
which it will be in our case).
The special case
FORMULA 
(due to Ville; see, e.g., {{cite:406c73e4-d158-4009-8cb1-c9f465118481}}, p. 100, or {{cite:36c920b1-5e37-4268-acaf-45c7c4fa4451}}, (2.12))
of Doob's inequality
shows that (REF ) will indeed be true with probability
at least FORMULA .

Derivation of strong confidence intervals
If the true probability density of FORMULA 
(conditional on the past) is
FORMULA 
and we want to reject the hypothesis
FORMULA 
the best, in many respectsCf., e.g., the nonnegativity of the Kullback–Leibler divergence,
Neyman–Pearson lemma,
and the optimality property of the probability ratio test in sequential analysis.,
martingale test
is the likelihood ratio sequence with the relative increments
FORMULA 
The product over FORMULA  is the martingale test itself:
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
To get rid of the parameter FORMULA ,
let us integrate (REF )
over the probability distribution FORMULA  on the FORMULA s:
FORMULA 
(where I made the substitution FORMULA ).
Now the formula
FORMULA 
gives
FORMULA 
To find the confidence intervals corresponding to (REF ),
fix a confidence level FORMULA .
The FORMULA -confidence interval corresponding to (REF )
is defined as the set of FORMULA s satisfying
FORMULA 
Solving this in FORMULA  gives the confidence interval
FORMULA 
Notice that,
in the stationary case FORMULA ,
where FORMULA  has the order of magnitude FORMULA ,
the size of the confidence interval (REF )
is FORMULA  as FORMULA .
This is worse that the usual iterated-logarithm behaviour
(FORMULA )
but agrees with {{cite:ae86fe68-54a8-418b-b1b2-c03e4efb638f}}, Theorem 2.5
(although the latter result is just an upper bound).
One can speculate that,
in the stationary case,
the FORMULA  behaviour
will be recovered if the FORMULA  is replaced
by a probability distribution that is more concentrated around FORMULA ,
as in Ville's {{cite:406c73e4-d158-4009-8cb1-c9f465118481}} proof of the law of the iterated logarithm
(see also {{cite:36c920b1-5e37-4268-acaf-45c7c4fa4451}}, Chapter 5).
Most of the terms
in the confidence interval (REF )
are familiar from the literature
(which, however, mainly covers the case of weak confidence intervals).
The centre FORMULA  of the interval
is just the least-squares estimate of FORMULA  from the given sample.
The statistic
FORMULA 
(for a fixed sample size FORMULA )
has been studied extensively.
In describing the known results I will follow {{cite:1140a27f-dfa1-484d-8c3e-ecf2f85d7f9d}}.
Mann and Wald {{cite:54b9a9ac-ec89-4696-9f05-5b37f7b7786e}} showed that FORMULA 
is FORMULA  asymptotically when FORMULA .
Anderson {{cite:6ffb2800-1724-4910-aa23-0fbc9f6f4b49}} extended this to the case FORMULA .
White {{cite:86b2e077-bcb2-49d5-9b76-bd5831246361}} and Rao {{cite:175bb625-7467-4343-814e-e9df490b124c}} showed that,
in the case FORMULA ,
FORMULA  converges in distribution to
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is a standard Brownian motion.
Suppose, for concreteness,
that (REF ) is asymptotically FORMULA .
The central asymptotic weak confidence interval for FORMULA 
based on the statistic given after the “FORMULA ” in (REF )
will be different from (REF )
in that
FORMULA 
will be replaced by the upper FORMULA -quantile of FORMULA ,
essentially by
FORMULA 
for a small FORMULA .
This is close to the first addend on the right-hand side of (REF ),
and so the second addend represents
the price that we are paying
for our confidence intervals being strong.

Empirical results
To test the test martingales (REF ) empirically,
I generated FORMULA  from the model (REF )
with FORMULA  and FORMULA .
The case FORMULA  illustrates the stationary behaviour (FORMULA ),
and the “unit-root” case FORMULA  is intermediate
between the stationary and “explosive” (FORMULA ) behaviour.
Tables REF  and REF 
give the approximate weak central FORMULA -confidence intervals
based on the above approximations for FORMULA 
(normal for FORMULA  and (REF ) for FORMULA )
and the strong FORMULA -confidence intervals
computed from (REF ).
TABLE 
TABLE 
The intuition behind the value of FORMULA  in (REF )
is that it should be of the same order of magnitude
as the expected width of the confidence interval
(since FORMULA  represents the order of magnitude
of the distance to the bulk of FORMULA  that we are competing with).
It is taken as FORMULA  in the tables,
but the results will not be drastically different
if FORMULA , which is intuitively more “neutral”,
is chosen: e.g.,
the width FORMULA  in Table REF 
would go up to FORMULA ,
and the width FORMULA  in Table REF 
would go up to FORMULA .
Figures REF  and REF 
give the final values FORMULA  for the same data set
and the same value of FORMULA ,
FORMULA .

Directions of further research
These are some possible areas
in which the methods of martingale testing could be applied:
Online testing of statistical models.
When the strong confidence interval FORMULA  becomes empty,
the statistical model can be rejected.
Of course, efficient testing of statistical models
will require different martingale tests:
it will not be sufficient to consider, as in this note, different values of parameters
as alternatives.
Prediction.
In the simplest case,
the prediction interval at step FORMULA 
might be computed as the union of the prediction intervals
corresponding to all FORMULA .
Alternative assumptions about innovations.
For example, the assumption that FORMULA  have zero medians
(conditional on the past)
might lead to feasible statistical procedures.
