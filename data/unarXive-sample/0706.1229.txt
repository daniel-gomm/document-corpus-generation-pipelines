2020/09/07 10:22:46Two scenarios of low temperature baryogenesis in theories with TeV
scale gravity are discussed. It is argued that strong gravity at TeV
energies is very favorable for baryogenesis. In both scenarios the
proton decay is either absent or suppressed far below existing bounds.
On the other hand, neutron-antineutron oscillations are at the verge
of discovery. Some other rare decays with non-conservation of lepton
or baryon numbers are predicted.
It is experimentally established that neither baryonic nor
individual leptonic numbers are conserved.
Neutrino oscillations are known to mix
electronic, muonic, and tauonic neutrinos, resulting in
nonconservation of all these quantum numbers. On the other hand,
astronomy proves that
baryon number is not conserved. One can say that
since we exist, baryons are not forever. Indeed a suitable for
life universe canot be created if baryonic charge were conserved.
The chain of arguments goes as follows. First, the asronomical data
strongly suggest that
inflation is an “experimental” fact. There are many reasons to
believe that this is true:
1. We do not know any other way to make the observed universe.
2. It explains the origin of expansion.
3. It solves the problems of homogeneity, isotropy, flatness and
predicts FORMULA .
4. Inflation creates density perturbations with the observed spectrum.
The next important statement is that
inflation is impossible with conserved baryons. Inflation could be
realized if the total cosmological energy density is (almost)
constant. However, if baryons are conserved the energy density
might stay constant at most during 4-5 Hubble times, while for
successful inflation at least 60 Hubble times are necesary. For
more details see e.g. review {{cite:40e5819a-c71b-41cd-b7b2-80f71ff8d7c3}}.
If baryon and lepton quantum
numbers are not conserved one should
expect this nonconservation to manifest
itself in particle physics. The
well known phenomena searched for are the following:
unstable proton, FORMULA -oscillations, some
rare decays, as e.g. FORMULA , and
similar decays of heavier quarks with
FORMULA  or FORMULA  nonconservation.
Yet nothing is observed. Though cosmology predicts non-conservation
of baryons and consequently a manifestation of this nonconservation in
particle physics, the magnitude of such effects is expected to be
very small or, at best, unknown
because the energy scale of cosmological baryogenesis is normally
much higher than that available in terrestrial experiments and,
what's more, there is usually no direct relation between physics
of baryogenesis and proton decays or neutron-antineutron oscillations.
Here we will discuss some new scenarios of
baryogenesis which explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the
universe and lead to observable consequences in particle physics.
My talk is based on the works made in collaboration with
F. Urban {{cite:5dc1f227-4bb6-4168-ac6d-ac5f6e3b9286}} and C. Bambi and K, Freese {{cite:69b46796-7575-4cb8-bd1a-52a7ddefaf7e}}, {{cite:4d658f72-7a2e-4c40-bf0d-7d6158e76b8a}}.
Let us first consider a rather conservative scenario based on
SUSY with broken FORMULA -parity . The
operators which break FORMULA -parity and experimental bounds on their coupling
constants are enumerated e.g. in review {{cite:1f768017-c38b-4788-82b8-a2b6cb893f56}}.
Cosmological baryogenesis in this model could proceed
through B-nonconserving decays of
massive SUSY particles induced by B-nonconserving FORMULA -parity violating
operators. If masses of supersymmetric particles are not very large,
e.g. FORMULA  TeV, deviations
from thermal equilibrium in the standard cosmology are
negligible:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the coupling constant. The baryon
asymmetry would be further suppressed at least by factor FORMULA 
because CP-violation manifests itself only in higher orders
of perturbation theory.
To obtain a reasonable baryon asymmetry the scale of supersymmetry must
be very high:
FORMULA 
However, in this case effects in
particle physics would be unnoticeable.
A possible solution which allows both for successful baryogenesis and
for nonnegligible effects in particle physics is offered by
TeV scale gravity.
There are two known mechanisms for TeV gravity:
1. Gravity lives in higher dimensional space, while matter lives in
 FORMULA{{cite:a636de7b-3d7a-456f-9399-056c5b35dc5c}}.
2. Time variation of FORMULA  due to the coupling
FORMULA  {{cite:9c591bc6-d283-4a71-804e-3ad3a20cb8d4}}.
It is assumed that initially (in the early universe) FORMULA  TeV,
and later, but prior to nucleosynthesis, it rises up to the Planck value
FORMULA  GeV.
Both these possibilities are practicaly equally good for cosmological
baryogenesis but in the first case care should be taken on the
potential problems with light gravitinos {{cite:ef47776c-f10a-470a-9cdc-febd58ece303}}.
Essential FORMULA -parity -violating operators have the form:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  are the flavor indices and FORMULA  and FORMULA  are respectively
operators of up and down quarks, tidle denotes a superpartner, and
FORMULA  is a Yukawa type coupling constant. The color
indices are suppressed. These operators do not conserve baryonic
charge, FORMULA , by one unit and conserve leptonic charge, FORMULA .
Correspondingly proton decay is forbidden but transformations of
baryon into antibaryon and, in particular, neutron-antineutron
oscillations are allowed. Such transformations inside a nuclei
would lead to an energetic annihilation and nuclear decay.
Correspondingly experimental bounds on nuclear stability allow
to put quite strong constraint on some FORMULA :
FORMULA 
while others could be even well above unity.
Non-zero FORMULA  would lead
e.g. to FORMULA  - transformation.
To make FORMULA  oscillations out of it a FORMULA 
process is necessary. It is strongly suppressed in MSM but
possibly not so much in a supersymmetric extension, in particular
in minimal supersymmetric model, MSSM.
The diagramm which induces FORMULA  transformation through
FORMULA  processes has the form:

Notice that strangeness non-conserving decays of zino, e.g.

decays of FORMULA -boson, not FORMULA , are not.
Both successful baryogenesis and
FORMULA  - transformation just above the
experimental limit might take place.
For more detail see ref. {{cite:5dc1f227-4bb6-4168-ac6d-ac5f6e3b9286}}.
Much more exotic possibility was put forward in refs. {{cite:69b46796-7575-4cb8-bd1a-52a7ddefaf7e}}, {{cite:4d658f72-7a2e-4c40-bf0d-7d6158e76b8a}}
in the frameworks of TeV gravity. The latter is known to suffer from
a serious problem related to nonconservation of all global quantum
numbers. The idea is basically that some (one or a few) particles,
possessing non-zero baryonic, leptonic, or any other global charges,
may form a very dense state inside their common gravitational
radius. In other words, they would form a small virtual black hole.
As is well known, black holes may have “hairs” associated only with
conserved quantum numbers related to local (gauge) symmetries, as
e.g. electric charge. On the other hand, if a black hole swallows
particles with non-zero leptonic, FORMULA , or baryonic, FORMULA , charges, it
immediately “forgets” about these charges and may decay into some
state with zero or any other values of FORMULA  or FORMULA . This was first
observed by Zeldovich {{cite:36429142-cf4f-47bb-b28b-b5caadc0dff1}}, who estimated the life-time
of proton due to formation and decay of a virtual black hole:
FORMULA 
This is by far larger than the existing experimental bound
FORMULA  years.
But if FORMULA  TeV, FORMULA  s.
Similar problems exist for FORMULA  and other rare decays.
These difficulties for low scale gravity was discussed in
ref. {{cite:823c4623-0688-4a98-9f0b-ff940df474f9}} where it was argued that the fundamental Planck
mass should be much larger than TeV, up to FORMULA  GeV. In our
recent works {{cite:69b46796-7575-4cb8-bd1a-52a7ddefaf7e}}, {{cite:4d658f72-7a2e-4c40-bf0d-7d6158e76b8a}} we made an attempt to resolve the
problem of strong gravitational FORMULA  and FORMULA  nonconservation
proposing the so called classical black hole conjecture, which
“dynamically” forbids an easy formation of black holes (BH).
This conjecture is based on the fact that classical charged and
rotating black hole can only be formed if it is sufficiently heavy:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are respectively electric charge and angular momentum
of BH. Formally it follows from this expression that if
FORMULA , the black hole can be only electrically
neutral and non-rotating.
The result (REF ) is valid for classical black holes and may be
incorrect for quantum ones. However, physics of quantum black holes is
unknown and one is free to make arbitrary and quite wild
assumptions.
In addition to this conjecture of neutral and non-rotating
BHs we impose some, maybe even more questionable, rules
in calculations/estimates of the amplitude of reactions
with broken global quantum numbers due to virtual BH.
We assume essentially that virtual black holes could be formed
only in s-channel with positive mass (energy) of the created
black hole. Such an assumption and some of the rules which we use
in what follows do not respect many
usual conditions existing in quantum field theory, in
particular crossing relations between amplitudes. For example,
we allow a virtual BH to decay into, say, a proton and a electron,
but we do not allow a proton to form a scalar BH plus a positron,
with the same amplitude. The picture that we have in mind is a kind
of time ordering: a BH could be formed in a collision of a neutral system
of particles in the s-channel whereas a BH
cannot be in the t-channel of a reaction.
We assume that BHs can be formed out of positive energies of real
particles only and not from virtual energies of particles in closed loops.
For example, BH cannot be formed by vacuum fluctuations, despite the fact
that, according to the standard picture, vacuum fluctuations might
create a pair or more of
virtual particles both with positive and negative energies.
The mass of the
BH should be of the order of the energy of incoming (or outgoing)
particles.
In an attempt to describe this in terms of the usual language we come to
a version of the old non-covariant perturbation theory with all virtual
particles having positive energies. It corresponds to the choice of only one
mass-shell pole in the Feynman Green's functions. This rule allows
only for BHs with masses which are of the order of the energies of the
initial (or final) particles, as we postulated above.
It may look very strange, to say the least, but virtual BHs are not
well defined objects and we do not know what happens with space-time
at the relevant scales. Taken literally these rules would lead to
violation of some sacred principles of the standard theory (locality, Lorentz
invariance, and more). Let us remind the reader, however, that the
existing attempts in the literature to invoke virtual BHs are based
on standard quantum field theory in a situation where it is
almost surely inapplicable.
So it is not excluded that many properties
of the standard field theory are broken, including even Lorentz
invariance and locality. We cannot of course present any serious
arguments in favor of our construction but it predicts quite
impressive phenomena with clear signatures based on a
very simple set of rules and if these
effects are discovered, the approach, advocated here,
may be taken more seriously.
Our goal here is to formulate a reasonable(?) set of rules
which may possibly describe processes with virtual BHs and
are, at least, not self-contradictory. Based on these rules we
study phenomenological consequences in particle physics,
which are quite rich and
may be accessible to experiments after a minor increase of accuracy.
The diagramm that, according to our conjecture, describes
gravitationally induced proton decay is presented in fig. 1
Since a 4-body collision is required in order
to form a BH devoid of any quantum number,
the process is strongly suppressed and experimental
constraints can be compatible even with the gravity
scale in TeV range.
FIGURE 
Similar graphs give rise to FORMULA  - decay and other rare
processess with violation of lepton flavor and baryonic numbers. The
results of our calculations, according to ref. {{cite:69b46796-7575-4cb8-bd1a-52a7ddefaf7e}} are
collected in Table 1, where the lower bound on the fundamental
gravity scale is presented for different numbers, FORMULA , of extra dimensions.
 TABLE

Thus we see that TeV scale gravity does not lead to contradiction with
experiment if the condition that virtual BH should have positive mass
and be electrically neutral and non-rotating, is fulfilled.
TeV scale gravity allows also for succesful, even quite efficinet,
baryogenesis at relatively low temperatures {{cite:4d658f72-7a2e-4c40-bf0d-7d6158e76b8a}}.
All three Sakharov conditions:
1) baryon non-conservation,
2) deviation from thermal equilibrium,
3) large CP-violation in MSM,
are much easier fulfilled than in the standard case.
Let us start from CP-violation. It is well known that
CP-breaking in the minimal standard model (MSM) is extemely
weak. The amplitude of CP-violation is known to be proportional
to the mass differences of all quark families and their mixing
angles, for detials see e.g. {{cite:1acb4c30-177c-474b-9410-f20a8cf56b1c}}:
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
Thus FORMULA  at
FORMULA  GeV. At lower temperatures the B-nonconserving
sphaleron processes are exponentially suppressed and one cannot
expect baryon-to-photon ratio larger than FORMULA , while the
observed value is FORMULA .
Low scale gravity models lead to nonconservation of baryonic charge
at much lower, than 100 GeV, temperatures because nonconservation of
FORMULA  takes place simply in decays of heavy quarks and non-perturbative
sphalerons are unnnecessary. According to the estimates of
ref. {{cite:4d658f72-7a2e-4c40-bf0d-7d6158e76b8a}}, non-conservation of baryons remains significant
even at FORMULA  GeV and the amplitude of CP-violation
(REF ) becomes 12 orders of magnitude larger.
One may avoid any suppression of CP violation at high temperatures
if time variation of quark masses is allowed {{cite:2648b63c-6402-4604-ae57-1588ac36d979}}, {{cite:4d658f72-7a2e-4c40-bf0d-7d6158e76b8a}}. In this
case both mixing angles and quark mass differences can be large
in the early universe.
Deviation from thermal equilibrium would be unsuppressed as it
follows from eq. (REF ) with FORMULA  TeV.

So to conclude:
1. Low scale gravity allows for much more efficient baryogenesis
than the standard model.
2. In conservative SUSY model with broken FORMULA -parity successful baryogenesis may proceed with (practically) stable proton
and with noticeable neutron-antineutron oscillations.
3. The classical black hole conjecture makes compatible TeV gravity
and low probability of B and L nonconserving processes.
4. The probability of such rare processes can be quite
close to the existing experimental bounds.
