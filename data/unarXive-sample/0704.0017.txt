Results from spectroscopic observations of the Intermediate Polar (IP) EX Hya in quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. Spin-modulated radial velocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first time in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near FORMULA  km sFORMULA . These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the outer edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion curtain with material near the Roche lobe radius.
Furthermore, spin Doppler tomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending from velocities of FORMULA  km sFORMULA  to FORMULA  km sFORMULA . These findings have confirmed the theoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and Norton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that extend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system.
Evidence for overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed, confirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is present during quiescence as well as outburst.
It appears that the HFORMULA  and HFORMULA  spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the outer disc edge, while those of HFORMULA  were produced due to the flow of material along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and close to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the accretion curtain model.
accretion discs, binary - stars: cataclysmic variables.
Introduction
EX Hya is an Intermediate Polar (IP), a sub-class of magnetic Cataclysmic Variable Stars (mCVs) where a late-type main sequence star transfers material to the magnetic white dwarf star as the two stars orbit each other under the influence of their mutual gravitation. Unlike in Polars, another subclass of mCVs, where the white dwarf is in synchronous rotation with the binary rotation (FORMULA ), the white dwarf in an IP is in asynchronous rotation with the orbital motion of the system. EX Hya, however, is nearer synchronism than the majority of IPs as it has a spin period (FORMULA 67.03 min) which is about FORMULA  its orbital period (98.26 min) {{cite:01003024-cf03-47dd-8453-3982032ac093}}, {{cite:e77e1db5-1ba4-453e-a1b9-6e54958616ea}}, and is one of only six out of thirty nine confirmed IPs with its orbital period below the 2-3 h CV period gap {{cite:ce010c60-fa1d-410d-865d-275ebb8a834b}}. It has an inclination FORMULA .
Recent studies have shown that EX Hya does not conform to the traditional IP model {{cite:aeb6af82-36a1-4568-bae6-60ef393318e8}}, {{cite:229e0677-0ab8-4f9a-9edf-18f63551018a}}, {{cite:7e5ebccf-43d6-4a49-b0ff-04d7dfd30a1e}}, {{cite:ce010c60-fa1d-410d-865d-275ebb8a834b}}, {{cite:f2cef63b-e64d-485a-9981-ce4b72398327}}. This system has a large FORMULA  ratio (FORMULA ) implying that it cannot be in the usual spin equilibrium rotation since most IPs have been shown to attain spin equilibrium near FORMULA  {{cite:aeb6af82-36a1-4568-bae6-60ef393318e8}}, {{cite:229e0677-0ab8-4f9a-9edf-18f63551018a}}.
This further implies that the corotation radius is far greater than the circularisation radius (FORMULA ) and that EX Hya cannot possess a Keplerian disc. Systems with Keplerian discs are expected to have FORMULA  and thus a smaller FORMULA .
These factors have prompted theorists to suggest that the spin equilibrium state in EX Hya is determined by FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the distance to the inner Lagrangian point, FORMULA  {{cite:aeb6af82-36a1-4568-bae6-60ef393318e8}}, {{cite:229e0677-0ab8-4f9a-9edf-18f63551018a}}, {{cite:ce010c60-fa1d-410d-865d-275ebb8a834b}}. In this model the accretion curtains extend to near the FORMULA  point, and EX Hya resembles an asynchronous Polar where most of the material accretes via the stream {{cite:aeb6af82-36a1-4568-bae6-60ef393318e8}}, {{cite:229e0677-0ab8-4f9a-9edf-18f63551018a}} and via both the ring of material near the Roche lobe radius of the primary and the stream {{cite:ce010c60-fa1d-410d-865d-275ebb8a834b}}, depending on the orbital and spin periods of the system, and the magnetic field strength. In the later publication it was shown that material in EX Hya is fed from a ring of material at the outer edge of the Roche lobe, and that for the FORMULA  of EX Hya, this mode of accretion is preferred over stream-fed accretion.
In this work we present spectroscopic data of EX Hya in quiescence obtained from the SAAO in 1991 (just before EX Hya went into outburst, and a day or two after outburst) and in 2001. Outburst data of 1991 will be discussed in a later publication.

Observations And Data Reduction
1991 Observations
TABLE 
EX Hya was observed in April of 1991 by Buckley et al. (1991) using the SAAO 1.9-m telescope with the Reticon photon counting system (RPCS) detector on the Cassegrain spectrograph. A grating with a resolution of 1200 mmFORMULA  was used and a wavelength range of 4000 - 5080 Å was covered at a spectral resolution of FORMULA 1.2 Å and at a time resolution of 100 - 120 s. The spectrograph slit width was 250 FORMULA m (FORMULA 1.5 arcsecs). Wavelength calibration exposures were taken using a CuAr arc lamp.
Three nights of observations (24, 25 and 29 April 1991) were covered in quiescence and, in total, 262 spectra were obtained. The observing log is given in Table REF  together with the starting times of the observations.
Following wavelength-calibration and sky-subtraction, the data were flux calibrated using the spectra of the standard star LTT3864.
FIGURE 

2001 Observations
The 2001 observations were obtained using the SITe CCD detector (FORMULA  pixels) on the Cassegrain spectrograph of the SAAO 1.9-m telescope. A grating with a resolution of 1200 mmFORMULA  was used over the wavelength range 4200 - 5100 Å on the nights of the 25th and 26th April. Another grating with a resolution of 1200 mmFORMULA  was used on the 24th, 25th and 26th April over the range 6300 - 7050 Å. The spectral resolution was FORMULA 1.0 Å and a 1FORMULA  binning scheme was employed (i.e. binning by FORMULA  in the spatial direction).
The exposure times during observations were 60 s.
The observations covered the period 24 April - 26 April 2001 and, in total, 262 spectra were obtained (Table REF ). The extraction and reduction of the data were performed the standard way using the Image Reduction and Analysis Facility (IRAF)IRAF is a software package for the reduction and analysis of astronomical data distributed by National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) package and the spectra were flux calibrated using observations of the standard star LTT3218.

The Radial Velocities
It is widely accepted that in a canonical CV, the high velocity emission line wings are formed in the inner parts of the accretion disc orbiting close to the white dwarf and thus should reflect its orbital motion {{cite:cf451f16-4718-4d60-b3c0-db1cfd140804}}, {{cite:b74445cc-005b-467d-9502-4cbbe9f21e02}}, {{cite:f7590be7-5a66-499c-b2ff-00d5e27ccc7c}}. In IPs, however, high velocity emission line wings are formed in the gas streaming towards the white dwarf at high velocities {{cite:e77e1db5-1ba4-453e-a1b9-6e54958616ea}}, {{cite:ead335f5-5637-4045-b694-5e3a134b9558}}.
FIGURE 
The radial velocities were determined by measuring the wings of the HFORMULA  and HFORMULA  emission lines from the 1991 data (24 and 25/04/91 - the data obtained on the 29th was not added since EX Hya had not fully recovered from outburst); and the wings of HFORMULA , HFORMULA  and HFORMULA  emission lines from the 2001 data using the Gaussian Convolution Scheme (GCS, Schneider & Young 1980; Shafter & Szkody 1984; Shafter 1985). The GCS method convolves each spectrum with two identical Gaussian, one in the red wing and one in the blue wing. The separation between the two Gaussians is 2FORMULA .
Care was taken not to include regions far out in the wings where the continuum begins to dominate by choosing reasonable values of the width (FORMULA ) of the Gaussians and FORMULA .
Twelve standard Gaussian band-passes were used with FORMULA  values ranging from 3500 to 100 km sFORMULA  and corresponding width values from 1200 to 100 km sFORMULA .
Period Searches
The radial velocities were Fourier transformed using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) algorithm to search for any periods in the data {{cite:a0e84d0d-4067-4e48-859c-51abb03fe8e6}}, {{cite:75dd40b7-e61a-474e-98e4-13ebbddbcdd8}}. The HFORMULA  and HFORMULA  amplitude spectra from 1991 (24 and 25 April) are shown in Figure REF  and the HFORMULA  amplitude spectra from 2001 are shown in Figure REF .
FIGURE 
A prominent peak at a frequency corresponding to the 98-minute orbital frequency, FORMULA , is observed in all the emission lines.
Second in strength to the orbital frequency is the spin frequency, FORMULA , of the narrow s-wave component (NSC) (FORMULA  km sFORMULA ) (Figures REF  and REF ).
The third panels from the top in Figures REF  and REF  show the data after prewhitening by FORMULA . Power at FORMULA  is clearly present.
The spin frequency was not detected at high values of FORMULA  (FORMULA  km sFORMULA ) where it is most expected (since at these velocities the material is quite close to the white dwarf and its emission is expected to be modulated at the white dwarf spin period). It was also not present in HFORMULA  and HFORMULA  radial velocities of 2001.
The amplitude of FORMULA  relative to FORMULA  was found to be FORMULA 81% for HFORMULA , FORMULA 64% for HFORMULA  and FORMULA 18% for HFORMULA .

Orbital Variations of the Emission Lines
The data were phase-binned on the orbital ephemeris of Hellier & Sprouts (1992),
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the number of orbital cycles and T is the time of mid-eclipse. This ephemeris is defined by the zero point of mid-eclipse, where minimum intensity is at phase 0.0. This means that for the radial velocities, maximum blueshift is perpendicular to the line of centres, at phase 0.75, meaning that spectroscopic phase zero occurs at the blue-to-red crossing of the emission line radial velocity curve. 40 phase bins were used to produce the radial velocities.
Orbital Tomograms and Trailed Spectra
FIGURE 
The HFORMULA , HFORMULA  and HFORMULA  Doppler tomograms were computed using the Back Projection Method (BPM) with the application of a filter, and the Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) {{cite:0d0e54f9-6462-40c4-b999-400bed26867d}}, {{cite:2a47f935-bdb9-4d0d-846e-ae555af443be}}, {{cite:c0b7ca94-bcd5-492a-ad08-f799c3293f07}}, {{cite:2b6d99ee-c0c4-4708-8953-84a69e701afb}}. The BPM Doppler maps are shown in Figure REF  and those constructed using MEM are shown in Figure REF .
Error in ephemerides (both orbital and spin) is sufficiently small to phase all of our data accurately on the orbital and spin cycles.
A velocity amplitude of the primary, FORMULA  km sFORMULA  from our radial velocity measurements and that of the secondary, FORMULA  km sFORMULA , taken from Vande Putte et al. (2003) and Beuermann et al. (2003), were used to fix the positions of the Roche lobe and the stream trajectories on the tomograms. A secondary mass, FORMULA  MFORMULA  for EX Hya was derived from the up-to-date secondary mass-period relation of Smith & Dhillon (1998). The mass of the primary, FORMULA , was then determined from the above values using FORMULA , and was found to be 0.50FORMULA 0.05 MFORMULA .
The HFORMULA , HFORMULA  and HeI FORMULA 4471 Doppler tomograms (Figure REF  and REF ) show strong emission at the bright spot, some at the Roche lobe and the stream, and some from the disc. Those of HFORMULA  also show strong bright spot emission but less or no emission from the stream. Disc emission is diminished in HFORMULA  when compared to other emission lines, especially at higher velocities. This is more obvious in the BPM tomogram. The bright spot emission falls near the region (-100, 350) km sFORMULA . Average-subtracted trailed spectra (Figure REF ) show the corresponding NSC.
FORMULA  (FORMULA 60-70%) of the original line fluxes is contained in the average-subtracted profiles of HFORMULA  and HFORMULA , and FORMULA  (FORMULA 80-90%) is contained in HFORMULA  and HeI FORMULA 4471. This flux is mainly due to the bright spot and the stream. The trailed spectra have been repeated over 2 cycles for clarity.
The trailed spectra of 2001 have revealed two interesting features. The first one is the asymmetry in the intensity of the s-wave (Figure REF ). In HFORMULA , the red wing of the NSC is brighter at FORMULA  and seems to reach maximum brightness near FORMULA , whereas the blue wing is dimmer in the range FORMULA  and seems to reach minimum brightness near FORMULA .
A similar effect is seen in the HFORMULA  and the HFORMULA  lines, and to a lesser extent in HeI FORMULA 4471.
The second feature is redshifted emission extending from the NSC to high velocities (FORMULA  km sFORMULA ) at early binary phases (FORMULA ).
The reconstructed trailed spectra suggest that this latter feature is another s-wave, which we shall refer to as the high velocity component (HVC), crossing the NSC near FORMULA . The Doppler tomograms show emission extending from the bright spot position, passing along the stream path, to the bottom-left quadrant at high velocities near 1000 km sFORMULA  which is responsible for the HVC; most of this emission does not fall within the disc and gas stream velocities on the map, suggesting that there was small or no overlap of the stream component with the disc.
The 1991 tomograms showed similar results. It is worth noting that most of the disc emission in 1991 came from the outer disc than in 2001.
Even though the MEM and BPM pick out the same features, in the BP tomograms some features are more prominent than in the MEM tomograms while the reconstruction obtained using the MEM reproduces the observed data well.
The advantage of BPM over MEM is that it is faster and it is easier to get a consistent set of maps of different emission lines (in terms of the apparent noise in the images). For this reason both methods have been used.

Spin Variations of the Emission lines
The Spin Radial Velocity Curve
The radial velocities were phase-folded using 30 bins on the quadratic spin ephemeris of Hellier & Sproats (1992), where spin maximum was defined as FORMULA .
FIGURE 
Figure REF  shows the variation of the HFORMULA , HFORMULA  and HFORMULA  narrow components with FORMULA .
Maximum blueshift is seen at FORMULA  for HFORMULA  and at FORMULA  for HFORMULA . Whereas for HFORMULA , maximum blueshift is seen at FORMULA . It should be noted that HFORMULA  and HFORMULA  / HFORMULA  have not been observed simultaneously and so both data sets probably sample the spin phases at different orbital phases.
Figure REF  shows the HFORMULA  narrow component (FORMULA  km sFORMULA ) and the broad-base component (FORMULA  km sFORMULA ) overplotted. The two components are in phase. The radial velocity variation with the spin period of the HFORMULA  and HFORMULA  broad-base component could not be detected, possibly due to velocity cancellation We discuss this in Section .
FIGURE 

Spin Tomograms and Trailed Spectra
Spin tomograms of EX Hya were constructed by {{cite:fd7d3566-2930-4d80-a0d7-509623bd93d9}} but revealed little information. Also, {{cite:f2cef63b-e64d-485a-9981-ce4b72398327}} observed no coherent emission site/s on their tomograms folded on the spin phase.
The HFORMULA  and the HFORMULA  BPM and MEM spin tomograms from 2001, however, have revealed a coherent emission site between VFORMULA  500 km sFORMULA  and FORMULA  1000 km sFORMULA  which is evidence of emission from the accretion curtains (Figures REF  and REF ). But it is a well known fact that since the spin period is FORMULA  of the orbital period in EX Hya, orbital cycle variations do not smear out when folded on the spin phase but repeat every 3 spin cycles {{cite:e77e1db5-1ba4-453e-a1b9-6e54958616ea}}. This is thought to be the origin of most of the structure in the emission lines at velocities FORMULA  km sFORMULA  {{cite:fd7d3566-2930-4d80-a0d7-509623bd93d9}}.
To address this problem, phase-invariant subtraction is performed where emission that does not vary with the spin cycle is subtracted from the data. This is achieved by measuring minimum flux at each wavelength and subtracting this value. The results are shown in the second panels from the top of Figure REF . It should be mentioned though, that even subtracting the invariant part of the line profiles does not guarantee that the influence of the orbital period variations has been completely removed.
FIGURE 
A spin-wave (to differentiate it from the s-wave which is normally caused by the bright spot) in the HFORMULA  trailed spectra (Figure REF ) was detected from the data after the phase-invariant subtraction was performed. This is the first detection of modulation over the spin cycle in the optical emission line data of EX Hya. This spin-wave can be seen in the trailed spectra before (but hard to see) and after subtraction of the phase-invariant line profile.
The narrow peak component is responsible for this spin-wave which is shown expanded in the second column of panels in Figure REF  (the narrow peak component was selected by hand over a velocity range of FORMULA  km sFORMULA ).
The spin-wave shows maximum blueshift near phase 1.0 and maximum redshift near phase 0.5, and has an amplitude of FORMULA  500 km sFORMULA . The HFORMULA  tomogram shows corresponding emission near the “3 o'clock” position (blob of emission right at the edge of the map), around FORMULA  500 km sFORMULA .
DFTs show lower amplitude (FORMULA  km sFORMULA  for HFORMULA  and FORMULA  km sFORMULA  for HFORMULA  and HFORMULA ) probably due to dilution by stationary material.
Also, the HFORMULA  MEM tomogram shows stronger emission that peaks in a broad structure at lower velocities (VFORMULA  -200 km sFORMULA  – FORMULA  +200 km sFORMULA  – around the “5-6 o'clock” position). Circular motion gives rise to low or zero radial velocities when the motion is perpendicular to the line of sight, and the emission seen around the “5-6 o'clock” position could not be from such velocities since it shows maximum blueshift at FORMULA . Similar emission was observed in a Polar and was thought to be due to material that has just been decelerated after having attached to the magnetic field lines {{cite:17f9c97b-d4a4-47d6-9605-9c6d62bdb05e}} (we discuss an alternative explanation in Section ). The emission near the edge of the tomogram (at FORMULA  500 km sFORMULA ) shows maximum blueshift at FORMULA  and therefore cannot be due to motion perpendicular to the line of sight either.
FIGURE 
The HFORMULA  trailed spectra also show emission coupled to the spin-wave near FORMULA  that extends to high velocities in the red, a similar situation to that seen the in orbital tomograms due to the HVC (Section REF ). The corresponding emission in the HFORMULA  tomograms extending to higher velocities in the red spectral region is not clear.
Both the HFORMULA  and HFORMULA  phase-invariant subtracted trailed spectra show three weak-intensity spin-waves. The most clearly visible of the three is phased with maximum redshift near FORMULA , with an estimated velocity amplitude of FORMULA  km sFORMULA  and corresponds to the emission near the “3 o'clock” position in the tomogram (Figure REF ). The reconstructed trailed spectra reproduce the observed data.
The HFORMULA  and HFORMULA  trailed spectra in Figure REF  seem to support these results. The emission observed near the “3 o'clock position” in the tomograms has also been seen in other IPs such as AO Psc and FO Aqr {{cite:fd7d3566-2930-4d80-a0d7-509623bd93d9}} and was interpreted as emanating from the upper accretion curtain.
The spin-waves are weak in intensity though, and more data are needed to support these results.

Discussion of the Orbital and Spin Data
The generally accepted model of EX Hya has the material leaving the secondary star through the LFORMULA  point, passing via a stream of material which orbits about the white dwarf, to form an accretion disc. The magnetic field lines of the white dwarf which form accretion curtains above and below the orbital plane channel the material from the disc, starting from the co-rotation radius (FORMULA ) where the disc is truncated by the field lines, to the surface of the white dwarf {{cite:e77e1db5-1ba4-453e-a1b9-6e54958616ea}}, {{cite:282e9b0f-3d90-4c0d-bfa1-cb1c7aba50dc}}.
King & Wynn (1999) challenged this model by arguing that systems with FORMULA  cannot possess Keplerian discs since this implies FORMULA . They showed that the spin equilibrium state in EX Hya is determined by FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the distance to the FORMULA  point. In this model the accretion curtains extend to near the FORMULA  point, and EX Hya resembles an asynchronous polar where most of the material accretes via the stream {{cite:aeb6af82-36a1-4568-bae6-60ef393318e8}}, {{cite:229e0677-0ab8-4f9a-9edf-18f63551018a}}.
Belle et al. (2002) revised the model of EX Hya after they showed that their EUV data support the model of King & Wynn (1999). Their revised model suggested that the magnetic field in EX Hya forms a large accretion curtain extending to the outer edge of the Roche lobe causing:

part or all of the non-Keplerian disc (hereafter the ring of material or the ring) to rotate with the white dwarf,

an extended bulge (later, Belle et al. (2005) showed that there was Vertically Extended Material (VEM) obscuring the s-wave emission during FORMULA , and evidence for overflowing stream accretion in EX Hya), and

the ring of material to feel magnetic force at the regions of the ring close to the poles, causing the ring material at these locations to be controlled by the magnetic field, forming two chunks along the accretion ring that rotate with the white dwarf.

Recently, Norton et al. (2004, 2004a) have shown that for systems with FORMULA , when the mass ratio is smaller at FORMULA , the material forms a ring near the edge of the primary Roche lobe, from where accretion curtains funnel down to the white dwarf surface, in agreement with King & Wynn (1999) and Belle et al. (2002). The material is fed from the ring (ring-fed accretion) and channeled along the magnetic field lines (when the angle between the white dwarf spin axis and magnetic dipole axis is small i.e  FORMULAFORMULA , which is true for EX Hya).
The discussion by {{cite:bb845ba5-0463-47ec-8351-c553384edd9f}} on the IR-UV flux distribution in EX Hya implies
a disc (isobaric and isothermal) with an outer radius of 1.6FORMULA  cm and a thickness of 2FORMULA  cm, and an assumed central hole of 6FORMULA  cm, but {{cite:bb845ba5-0463-47ec-8351-c553384edd9f}} suggested that the structure could also be a ring with a larger inner radius, in line with the suggestion of {{cite:aeb6af82-36a1-4568-bae6-60ef393318e8}}, {{cite:7e5ebccf-43d6-4a49-b0ff-04d7dfd30a1e}} and {{cite:ce010c60-fa1d-410d-865d-275ebb8a834b}}. They found that the disc component contains about 1/6 of the total flux which is a bit more than expected from gravitational energy release at the inner radius, RFORMULA  cm.
Our spectroscopic data support both the model of Belle et al. (2002) and Norton et al. (2004) in which material from a ring, circling the white dwarf and co-rotating with the magnetic field lines at the outer edge of the Roche lobe, is accreted by the white dwarf.
The presence of the bright spot revealed by the trailed spectra, the DFTs of the radial velocities and the Doppler maps (Figures REF  and REF ) suggest the presence of a disc or ring of material extending to near the Roche lobe radius, around the white dwarf. When comparing the 1991 and 2001 tomograms for the HFORMULA  they appear to be in the same state or similar, given the fact that they are ten years apart. It is reassuring that the fact that the two groups of lines have not been measured simultaneously is not a significant problem in the analysis.
More importantly, a spin pulse modulated at velocities consistent with those of the material circulating at the outer edge of the disc (FORMULA  km sFORMULA ) (Figures REF  and REF ) was detected and provides evidence for co-rotation of the extended accretion curtains with the ring material. As discussed in Section REF , these low radial velocities mentioned above were not caused by motion perpendicular to the line of sight near the white dwarf, neither were they caused by velocity cancellation as will be shown later.
A spin wave was detected in the spin-folded trailed spectra of HFORMULA  (Figure REF ) with a velocity semi-amplitude of FORMULA  500-600 km sFORMULA . The spin wave shows maximum blue-shift near phase FORMULA  (when the upper magnetic pole is pointed away from the observer) and maximum redshift near phase FORMULA . The HFORMULA  equivalent widths show maximum flux near FORMULA . This picture is consistent with the accretion curtain model of IPs and is possible if accretion occurs via a disc/ring.
The spin tomograms (Figures REF  and REF ) show evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending from FORMULA  km sFORMULA  to high velocities (FORMULA  km sFORMULA ), suggesting that material is channeled along the field lines from the outer ring. The HFORMULA  narrow and broad base components show similar phase variation, suggesting same position of maximum radial velocity as shown in Figures  REF  and REF  (line OA). This indicates that material is channeled from the ring (at low velocities) to high velocities along the field lines.
A mass ratio of FORMULA  0.2 was measured from our data, and so the period ratio FORMULA  FORMULA  is consistent with the ring accretion model of Norton et al. (2004).
Decreased prominence of the narrow s-wave component around FORMULA  (Figure REF  and REF ) was observed and suggests the presence of VEM at the outer edge of the ring of material obscuring the emission at these phases. The presence of the overflow stream may be infered from this observation {{cite:f2cef63b-e64d-485a-9981-ce4b72398327}}.
But direct evidence comes from orbital Doppler tomograms which show an asymmetry in the emission, where more emission is observed from the secondary Roche lobe to the lower left quadrant than from the opposite side. Average-subtracted orbital tomograms show this emission at higher velocities (FORMULA 900-1000 km sFORMULA ) (Figures REF  and REF ), and it corresponds to the HVC observed in the trailed spectra, which is modulated with a velocity semi-amplitude of FORMULA  km sFORMULA .
This HVC is reminiscent of that detected by Rosen et al. (1987) in the trailed spectra of the AM Her system V834 Cen. Their HVC was blueshifted with a velocity of FORMULA  km sFORMULA and was said to be produced in the stream close to the white dwarf. The only difference is that there was no evidence of the HVC emission when it was expected to be seen redward of another component (medium-velocity component) in their data, whereas in EX Hya the evidence of the HVC emission is missing between FORMULA . The HVC emission is maximally blueshifted at FORMULA . This phasing is consistent with the expected phase of impact of a stream of material from the secondary with the disc or of the overflow stream material free-falling onto the magnetosphere of the primary {{cite:39ed67e5-0537-414d-bf6b-010eb00823f4}}.
Support for overflow stream is also provided by spin tomograms where emission is observed on the upper accretion curtain with velocities consistent with stream velocities. This suggests that this emission site may also have resulted due to impact of overflow stream with the magnetosphere. The resulting emission is receding from the observer at maximum redshift near FORMULA  (Figure REF ), in agreement with the accretion curtain model.
The model of {{cite:aeb6af82-36a1-4568-bae6-60ef393318e8}} is not fully supported by our observations since it predicts direct accretion via a stream. Our observations, however, fit the models of {{cite:ce010c60-fa1d-410d-865d-275ebb8a834b}} and {{cite:7e5ebccf-43d6-4a49-b0ff-04d7dfd30a1e}}, {{cite:f2cef63b-e64d-485a-9981-ce4b72398327}}.
FIGURE 
There is evidence for strong HFORMULA  emission of the narrow s-wave component in the spin tomograms, centred around FORMULA  km sFORMULA  (Figure REF ), that is not accounted for by these models. This emission shows maximum blueshift at phase FORMULA , suggesting that these are rotational velocities (or a combination of streaming and rotational velocities) of the antiphased motion of a source locked to the white dwarf. One possible explanation is that this emission comes from the opposite pole of the white dwarf, at a radial distance of 6FORMULA  cm (FORMULA 8RFORMULA ). {{cite:a2b19a48-31dd-4323-9804-bd5d7134627c}} found that the eclipsed optical source in EX Hya is centred at a radial distance of 1.5FORMULA  cm (FORMULA 2RFORMULA ), which is about four times closer to the white dwarf compared to our result. This could be the same emission region, but in our observations the emission is spread out, possibly due to the quality of the data, and this could account for the difference in the radial distance values quoted above. But we cannot imagine a geometry where such low rotational velocities can dominate over streaming velocities along the field lines near the white dwarf. We therefore suggest that this is evidence for material that is diverted out of the orbital plane. Since one of the assumptions of Doppler tomography is that everything lies on the plane, it is not possible to locate the exact position of this emission relative to the white dwarf.

White dwarf and secondary masses
{{cite:e77e1db5-1ba4-453e-a1b9-6e54958616ea}} showed that maximum line widths of FORMULA  km sFORMULA  constrain the mass of the white dwarf, and a free-fall velocity of this magnitude could be achieved for white dwarf masses greater than 0.48 MFORMULA . We found MFORMULA , in good agreement with the results obtained from recent studies by {{cite:bc8140f3-b34c-41e1-93b4-0437fd9a4fde}}, {{cite:f116ce40-8b19-4a47-8b31-d1dd1d73a4ad}} and {{cite:63fd5f10-b832-44fe-b7f8-eeb7b9e4cd28}}.
For the secondary, we derived MFORMULA  MFORMULA  from the secondary mass-period relation of Smith & Dhillon (1988), and this value agrees with that obtained by {{cite:63fd5f10-b832-44fe-b7f8-eeb7b9e4cd28}}. {{cite:f116ce40-8b19-4a47-8b31-d1dd1d73a4ad}} and {{cite:bc8140f3-b34c-41e1-93b4-0437fd9a4fde}} find lower values for MFORMULA  consistent with 0.09 MFORMULA . {{cite:bb845ba5-0463-47ec-8351-c553384edd9f}} argues that for a secondary mass as low as 0.1 MFORMULA  the secondary would have to be substantially expanded by FORMULA 10%.

The revised model of EX Hya
We propose a model where one of the two chunks alluded to by Belle et al. (2002), which are formed by the magnetic pull along the accretion ring, co-rotates with the accretion curtains at the outer edge of the Roche lobe at FORMULA  500-600 km sFORMULA , giving rise to the pulsation of emission at the spin period which we observe in our data, while the other is hidden by the accretion curtain below the ring of material.
The resulting emission is maximally blueshifted near FORMULA  (Figure REF ). In the accretion curtain model, at FORMULA  in the spin cycle, minimum flux (due to higher opacity) is observed when the upper accretion pole of the white dwarf is pointed towards the observer {{cite:e77e1db5-1ba4-453e-a1b9-6e54958616ea}}, and so the phasing mentioned above is compatible with the motion of a rotating accretion funnel. This is illustrated in Figure REF , where the position of the observer at pulse maximum is indicated, and the axis of the magnetic pole is shown. The disruption of the disc by the magnetic field at the outer disc is illustrated and part of the disc co-rotating with the magnetosphere is shown.
At a corotation radius, FORMULA  FORMULA  (FORMULA  cm), the material is rotating at a velocity of FORMULA  FORMULA  km sFORMULA , in good agreement with the observations.
Also, a rotation velocity of FORMULA  km sFORMULA  was measured from the spectra and the radial distance from the star to the ring of material was found to be FORMULA  cm, which is similar to FORMULA , for a white dwarf mass of 0.5 MFORMULA  (Keplerian motion about the white dwarf had to be assumed in these calculations). At this radius, the accretion curtain is also rotating at a velocity of 2FORMULA /PFORMULA  FORMULA  km sFORMULA .
FORMULA  ergs cmFORMULA  sFORMULA  (64% - integrated over one spin cycle) of the original line fluxes that is contained in the average-subtracted profile of HFORMULA  shows radial velocity variations with the spin period. Assuming that HFORMULA  and HFORMULA  also show a similar flux variation (HFORMULA  and HFORMULA  spin tomograms also show a low-velocity s-wave but this result is not secured due to poor quality of data), the total line fluxes showing radial velocity variations with the spin period can be estimated to be FORMULA  ergs cmFORMULA  sFORMULA  for the three emission lines. This is FORMULA 2/10 of the total disc flux {{cite:bb845ba5-0463-47ec-8351-c553384edd9f}}, suggesting that only part of the ring corotates with the white dwarf while the rest of the material may be involved in a near Keplerian motion (this is a rough comparison since the flux is integrated over one spin cycle for HFORMULA , HFORMULA  and HFORMULA  in our data whereas {{cite:bb845ba5-0463-47ec-8351-c553384edd9f}} derived their total flux values from one spectrum over the wavelength range FORMULA  Å).
While some of the ring material co-rotates with the accretion curtains (i.e. remains in the disc rather than being immediately channeled along the field lines), some is channeled along the field lines at FORMULA  km sFORMULA  towards the white dwarf. There is also some material that overflows the ring and attaches onto the magnetic field lines.
The overflow stream hits the magnetosphere, probably causing a second bright spot on the slowly rotating magnetosphere (Figure REF ).
The overflow stream is irradiated by the white dwarf in its inner regions close to the white dwarf (the regions facing the white dwarf). This results in the HVC emission being obscured at FORMULA , which are phases where the stream is viewed from behind-opposite the side facing the white dwarf, hiding the irradiated inner regions. HVC emission from the stream is blueshifted when that from the narrow s-wave component shows maximum redshift. Near FORMULA  the two s-waves intersect, explaining the asymmetry in the brightness of the s-wave seen near FORMULA  (Figure REF ). The overflow stream curls nearly behind the white dwarf and it is truncated by the field when the upper magnetic pole is facing the stream.
Ferrario & Wickramasinghe (1993) and Ferrario, Wickramasinghe & King (1993) showed that in IPs the accretion curtain below the orbital plane can contribute in the radial velocities of a system if it can be seen either through the central hole of the truncated disc, or from below the disc, or both. This effect will result in velocity cancellation due to nearly equal quantities of material that are blueshifted and redshifted on the accretion curtains (Ferrario, Wickramasinghe & King 1993).
In EX Hya where the inclination is high (78FORMULA ) and the disruption radius is large (FORMULA  40 RFORMULA , for a white dwarf mass of 0.5 MFORMULA ) as proposed in Figure REF , it is clear that we see spin-varying emission from two opposite magnetic poles, producing a fairly symmetric structure in the spin-folded line profiles {{cite:e77e1db5-1ba4-453e-a1b9-6e54958616ea}}, {{cite:282e9b0f-3d90-4c0d-bfa1-cb1c7aba50dc}}. If emission from these opposite poles is cancelling out then the sum will have a much lower velocity. This could explain the near zero and low amplitude of the radial velocity variation at the spin period of the HFORMULA  and HFORMULA , and HFORMULA  (FORMULA  40 km sFORMULA ) broad-base component, respectively (see also {{cite:e77e1db5-1ba4-453e-a1b9-6e54958616ea}} and Ferrario, Wickramasinghe & King (1993)).
One could take this argument further by suggesting that the spin modulation we observe in our data at velocities near FORMULA  km sFORMULA  (Figures REF  and REF ) is just the slight asymmetries between the two poles. The resulting velocity could just be a measure of the degree to which the poles cancel their velocities near FORMULA  km sFORMULA (Coel Hellier; private communication). This, however, cannot be the case for HFORMULA  and HFORMULA  since these two emission lines show motion that is consistent with that of a rotating object, suggesting that the line profiles are not dominated by the infall velocities at the two opposite accretion poles. If they were produced close to the white dwarf then maximum rotational velocity near FORMULA  km sFORMULA  would be 2FORMULA  30 km sFORMULA , which is much smaller than FORMULA  km sFORMULA . However, rotional velocities close to the ring are FORMULA  km sFORMULA .
For HFORMULA , however, we observe maximum blueshift at FORMULA , and so velocity due to cancellation anywhere between 0 and FORMULA  km sFORMULA are expected, depending on how much the two poles cancel. If both accretion curtains are still visible and symmetric at large radii (which is possible as suggested by Ferrario, Wickramasinghe & King (1993) and our model), velocity cancellation will still result in smaller amplitudes than those of FORMULA  km sFORMULA observed in our data. This would then count against the argument above.
Furthermore, HFORMULA  orbital Doppler tomograms show strong emission at the bright spot. If our model is correct, the field lines should also attract this HFORMULA  dominated material, which is chanelled along the field lines, as already shown above. The velocity of this material due to streaming motion near the outer ring is less than that of the HFORMULA  broad-base component close to the white dwarf, as expected.
A strong constraint on our model is that the disruption radius of EX Hya has been shown to be at 5-9FORMULA  cm {{cite:e77e1db5-1ba4-453e-a1b9-6e54958616ea}}, {{cite:f116ce40-8b19-4a47-8b31-d1dd1d73a4ad}} which implies a white dwarf magnetic moment of FORMULA  G cmFORMULA . For our model this would imply that the accretion curtains do not extend to near the Roche lobe radius. The theoretical analysis of {{cite:aeb6af82-36a1-4568-bae6-60ef393318e8}} and {{cite:229e0677-0ab8-4f9a-9edf-18f63551018a}}, however, has shown that equilibrium rotation is possible if the magnetic moment in EX Hya falls within the range of 10FORMULA  G cmFORMULA . These are comparable to weakest field AM Hers below the period gap, and that EX Hya could possess such magnetic moments is supported to a certain extent by the average-subtracted trailed spectra of EX Hya that are reminiscent of emission lines seen in some Polars, e.g. V834 Cen (as discussed above), EF Eri {{cite:1173535a-f0a8-457f-b43b-40f780e442bf}}, {{cite:678eda38-a0ab-436a-9eb4-2b4abfc85908}}, QS Tel {{cite:bfe62fab-f145-4fdc-81f4-e8f4532686cf}} and VV Pup {{cite:41a5088a-5161-4b9e-aaf2-08dc29e85f29}}.
Furthermore, {{cite:89fec35b-bd61-4f37-a74e-086af6fc8e6e}} raised the possibility that the magnetic fields in IPs are buried by the material due to high accretion rates and so are not really as low as they appear. The ring structure in EX Hya could imply higher accretion rates in EX Hya than previously thought since the capacity of the ring of material to store matter may be low when compared to that of a classical disc, resulting in the accretion of more material than in a classical disc case.

Summary
Optical observations of EX Hya and the analysis have suggested that large accretion curtains extending to a distance close to the LFORMULA  point exist in this system. The DFTs and spin tomograms have for the first time provided evidence for corotation of the field lines with the ring material near the Roche lobe. Also, tomography and the phasing of the spin waves have suggested that feeding by the accretion curtains of the material from the ring (ring-fed accretion) takes place.
These findings support the models of Belle et al. (2002) and Norton et al. (2004) for EX Hya and the simulations done by Norton et al. (2004a) which have shown that for systems with the parameters of EX Hya, the accreting material forms a ring at the outer edge of the primary Roche lobe, from where accretion curtains funnel down to the white dwarf surface.
Evidence for stream overflow accretion has been observed. The HVC caused by the overflow stream disappeared at FORMULA  due to obscuration by the stream. Obscuration of the NSC at FORMULA  suggested the presence of the VEM which was irradiated by the white dwarf in its inner regions.
The HFORMULA  broad-base component shows a radial velocity variation with the spin period whereas that of HFORMULA  and HFORMULA  could not be detected. The low-amplitude velocity variations modulated at the spin period for HFORMULA  and for HFORMULA  and HFORMULA  is explained in terms of velocity cancellation effects.
We have provided an explanation for the asymmetry in the intensity of the narrow s-wave component seen in EX Hya trailed spectra in the optical. The narrow s-wave component and the HVC cross at FORMULA , resulting in the asymmetry in brightness that we observe at these phases.
The spin-folded trailed spectra are not of good quality and more data are needed to confirm these results.
