Compton scattering of X-rays in the bulk flow of the accretion column in
magnetic cataclysmic variables (mCVs) can significantly shift photon energies.
We present Monte Carlo simulations based on a nonlinear algorithm
demonstrating the effects of Compton scattering on the H-like, He-like and
neutral Fe KFORMULA  lines produced in the post-shock region of the accretion
column. The peak line emissivities of the photons in the post-shock flow are
taken into consideration and frequency shifts due to Doppler effects are also
included. We find that line profiles are most distorted by Compton scattering
effects in strongly magnetized mCVs with a low white dwarf mass and high mass
accretion rate and which are viewed at an oblique angle with respect to the
accretion column. The resulting line profiles are most sensitive to the
inclination angle. We have also explored the effects of modifying the
accretion column width and using a realistic emissivity profile. We find that
these do not have a significant overall effect on the resulting line profiles.
A comparison of our simulated line spectra with high resolution
Chandra/HETGS observations of the mCV GK Per indicates that a wing
feature redward of the 6.4 keV line may result from Compton recoil near the
base of the accretion column.

Introduction
Magnetic cataclysmic variables (mCVs) are close interacting binaries consisting
of a magnetic white dwarf (WD) and a low mass red dwarf {{cite:62256dc0-b801-4b8e-b396-d976fd11ef83}}. Near
the white dwarf surface the accretion flow in mCVs is confined by the magnetic
field of the WD and is channelled to the magnetic pole region(s) of the WD,
forming an accretion column {{cite:62256dc0-b801-4b8e-b396-d976fd11ef83}}, {{cite:7c313ad0-a36e-4f8d-8b5c-45f9d73abf9a}}, {{cite:a838ebfb-366b-4356-94aa-496295cbc6b3}}, {{cite:c9124f9f-a5ee-4c84-998e-ef4654046f8b}}.
Near the base of the accretion column, material in supersonic free-fall is
brought to rest on the WD surface, forming a standing shock which heats and
ionizes the accreting plasma. The shock temperature FORMULA  depends mainly
on the mass FORMULA  and radius FORMULA  of the WD and is given by
{{cite:a838ebfb-366b-4356-94aa-496295cbc6b3}}
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the mean molecular weight and FORMULA  is the shock height.
For WD masses FORMULA  and typical mCV parameters,
the shock temperature is FORMULA  K. The plasma in the post-shock region of the column cools by
emitting bremsstrahlung X-rays and optical/IR cyclotron radiation
{{cite:fb6a42eb-cebc-478a-802e-486ab5b0f3e6}}, {{cite:d2101cb1-0021-4dd7-96f5-c70214181670}}. Since cooling occurs along the flow, the post-shock region
is stratified in density and temperature. The height of the post-shock region
is determined by the cooling length. For a flow with only bremsstrahlung
cooling, the shock height is given by {{cite:a30d6447-0918-414d-a7a6-4a09d9f7a653}}
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the specific mass accretion rate.
A plasma temperature of FORMULA  keV is sufficient to fully ionize
elements such as argon, silicon, sulphur, aluminium or calcium. Heavier
elements such as iron can be highly ionized, resulting in H-like Fe
XXVI and He-like Fe XXV ions. K-shell transitions
in Fe XXVI and Fe XXV ions give rise to
KFORMULA  lines at 6.97 keV and 6.675 keV, respectively {{cite:4b091113-6299-43e3-85ce-9915318cafe2}}. The irradiation of low ionized and neutral iron by X-rays above the Fe
K edge produces fluorescent KFORMULA  emission at approximately 6.4 keV inside
the WD atmosphere, beneath the accretion column and in surrounding areas. The
natural widths of the Fe KFORMULA  lines are small, but the lines can be
Doppler broadened by the bulk and thermal motions of the emitters in the
post-shock flow. The bulk velocity immediately downstream of the shock is
FORMULA  for
typical mCV parameters. Lines can also be broadened by scattering processes.
Compton (electron) scattering is expected to be more important than resonance
(ion) scattering for the KFORMULA  transitions {{cite:1b7301c7-e47c-49dd-8c5d-fdbb225bdf82}}. For an mCV with
specific accretion rate FORMULA  the electron number density is
FORMULA  for a shock heated region of thickness
FORMULA , giving a Thompson optical depth of FORMULA . Thus, one in every ten photons would encounter an electron before
leaving the post-shock region. The relative importance of Doppler shifts,
thermal Doppler broadening and Compton scattering depends on the ionization
structure in the post-shock flow.
X-ray observations by Chandra/HETGS and ASCA/SIS have
revealed significant broadening of some Fe KFORMULA  lines in mCVs
{{cite:a74d1a8a-336d-4128-8c0a-08a234fe92ea}}, {{cite:fdf1c78c-962b-4444-b0c6-f7331f43c1dc}}. It was suggested that Compton scattering in the
accretion column is largely responsible for the broadening in the observed
lines. Doppler broadening should only be significant in lines emitted close to
the shock. The absence of Doppler shifts in the observed H-like and He-like
lines suggests that these photons may be emitted predominantly from regions of
lower velocity near the base of the accretion column {{cite:fdf1c78c-962b-4444-b0c6-f7331f43c1dc}}. The
observed line profiles have yet to be fully interpreted with a quantitative
model that takes into account Compton scattering effects in a complex
ionization structure.
In this paper, we study the effects of Compton scattering in the accretion
column of mCVs using a nonlinear Monte Carlo algorithm
{{cite:916f0b51-0be1-464d-a943-e9041ebe39a2}}, {{cite:87262cea-c145-4da2-ad30-046577083bd0}} that self-consistently takes into account the
density, velocity and temperature structure in the column {{cite:4b091113-6299-43e3-85ce-9915318cafe2}}. The
effects of dynamical Compton scattering are also included. In a preliminary
investigation {{cite:52cb74f8-9d0d-4903-8320-efa02cb78756}}, it was found that Fe KFORMULA  line photons
emitted from the dense base of the accretion column undergo multiple Compton
scatterings and as a result, the base of the line profile is substantially
broadened. Photons emitted near the shock can also undergo scatterings with
hot electrons immediately downstream of the shock, as well as cold electrons in
the pre-shock flow before escaping the column. The resulting line profiles
display a shoulder-like feature redward of the line centre. More significant
broadening is observed when cyclotron cooling is sufficiently strong to produce
a dense, compact post-shock region {{cite:a838ebfb-366b-4356-94aa-496295cbc6b3}}. Here, we
make three substantial improvements to the previous study: (i) we include
Doppler effects; (ii) the photon source regions in the post-shock column are
determined from the ionization structure, rather than specified arbitrarily;
and (iii) the effects of different viewing angles are fully explored. The paper
is organized as follows: the theoretical outline and geometry of the model are
described in Section 2. Numerical results for cases where cyclotron cooling is
negligible and when it dominates are presented and discussed in Section 3. A
summary and conclusions are presented in Section 4.

Theoretical Model
Physical Processes
Line photons can undergo energy changes when scattering with electrons,
resulting in distortions in the line profile. The energy change of a photon
per scattering is given by {{cite:1b7301c7-e47c-49dd-8c5d-fdbb225bdf82}},
FORMULA 
where E is the initial photon energy, FORMULA  is the electron
energy, with FORMULA  and where FORMULA  includes
both thermal and bulk motion, FORMULA  is the incident photon
propagation angle measured relative to the electron's direction of motion, and
the scattering angle is FORMULA . The prime superscript denotes quantities
after a scattering event. Although the energy change per scattering is
typically small, the line profile can be broadened considerably as a result of
multiple scatterings if the optical depth is large.
Photons scattering with hot electrons (i.e. FORMULA  where
FORMULA  is the electron temperature and FORMULA  is the line centre
energy) will gain energy, while photons scattering with cold electrons
(FORMULA ) will lose energy due to recoils. In the mCV
context, Compton recoil can be important for photons scattering with electrons
in the cold pre-shock flow and also near the base of the column, where
FORMULA  rapidly decreases and where the optical depth is high. From
equation (REF ), the fractional energy change due to Compton recoil
FORMULA  is
FORMULA 
In the post-shock accretion column in mCVs, line photons undergo thermal
Doppler broadening as well as Doppler shifts. The bulk velocity of the
accreting material immediately downstream of the shock is FORMULA . For all inclination angles FORMULA  (see Figure REF ),
the bulk flow is moving away from our line of sight, so the line centre energy
is redshifted by an amount FORMULA . However, since the
bulk velocity in the post-shock flow in mCVs is always less than a few
FORMULA , giving FORMULA , Doppler shifts
are expected to be negligible. Thermal Doppler broadening, on the other hand,
is expected to be of order FORMULA  for lines emitted in the hottest regions of the post-shock flow
(i.e. immediately downstream of the shock), where FORMULA  is the mass of
the ion.
In strongly magnetized mCVs, cyclotron emission is the dominant cooling
process. The effect of this additional electron cooling process in the
post-shock region is to reduce the shock height and modify the density and
temperature structure of the region {{cite:a30d6447-0918-414d-a7a6-4a09d9f7a653}}. This can enhance Compton
scattering features in line profiles {{cite:52cb74f8-9d0d-4903-8320-efa02cb78756}}.

Geometry of the Accretion Column
FIGURE 
The geometry of an mCV accretion column is shown in figure REF .
The column is modelled as a cylinder and is divided into a shock heated
region and a cool pre-shock region. In the pre-shock region, the density and
velocity of the accreting material are constant. The velocity of the pre-shock
flow is approximated by the free-fall velocity at the shock height,
FORMULA , and the plasma is
assumed to be cold (FORMULA ). The electron number density
in the pre-shock flow is FORMULA , where
FORMULA  is the specific mass accretion rate. In the post-shock region, the
density, velocity and temperature profiles are calculated using the
hydrodynamic solution described in {{cite:a30d6447-0918-414d-a7a6-4a09d9f7a653}}, for bremsstrahlung and
cyclotron cooling. The parameters that determine the structure of the
post-shock region are the WD mass FORMULA , the WD radius FORMULA , the specific
mass accretion rate FORMULA  and the ratio of the efficiencies of cyclotron
cooling to bremsstrahlung cooling FORMULA .
The accretion column is viewed from an inclination angle FORMULA , measured relative
to the column axis (see Fig. REF ). An inclination angle FORMULA 
corresponds to viewing the column along its axis, towards the WD, while viewing
the column from an inclination angle FORMULA  is equivalent to viewing
the column from the side.
The line photons are injected into the post-shock region at a specific
dimensionless height FORMULA  at or above the WD surface,
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  correspond to the WD surface and shock
surface, respectively (see Fig. REF ). For each set of mCV
parameters, the injection point of the line corresponds to the location in the
post-shock region where the emissivity of the specific line peaks, according to
the ionization structure determined by {{cite:4b091113-6299-43e3-85ce-9915318cafe2}}. The bulk and thermal
velocities at the line injection height FORMULA  are used to calculate the
Doppler shift and broadening of the lines.
The Monte Carlo technique is used to model Compton scattering effects on
photon propagation in the column. The distance to a tentative scattering point
is determined using an algorithm based on a nonlinear transport
technique {{cite:ea7a3053-c73e-4959-8cb1-fc8c391c224f}} which integrates the mean free path over the spatially
varying electron density {{cite:916f0b51-0be1-464d-a943-e9041ebe39a2}}, {{cite:87262cea-c145-4da2-ad30-046577083bd0}}. The scattering cross-section
is determined from the Klein-Nishina formula and the momentum vector at the
scattering point is drawn from an isotropic Maxwellian distribution at the
local temperature. A rejection algorithm is used to decide whether the
scattering is accepted {{cite:87262cea-c145-4da2-ad30-046577083bd0}}. For an accepted event the energy and
momentum changes of the photon are calculated as described in {{cite:1b7301c7-e47c-49dd-8c5d-fdbb225bdf82}}.
In each simulation photons are followed until they leave the column and binned
to form a spectrum. A full description of the numerical algorithm can be found
in {{cite:916f0b51-0be1-464d-a943-e9041ebe39a2}}.
In the simulations described below, we make the following simplifying
assumptions: a fixed number of FORMULA  photons are used to simulate each line;
a single energy is used for each line (whereas in reality, the neutral and
Lymann FORMULA  transitions are doublets, with energies 6.391/6.404 keV and
6.952/6.973 keV, and the He-like transition has both resonant,
inter-combination and forbidden components); a fixed accretion column width
is used and a single line injection site is used.

Results and Discussion
FIGURE 
We present simulations of Compton scattering of Fe KFORMULA  lines in an mCV
accretion column for two different WD mass-radius values:
FORMULA  and
FORMULA  {{cite:ded1c1de-3429-4e32-94d0-e5977f7d9798}}.
For each mass, we consider two different specific mass accretion rates,
FORMULA  and FORMULA , and inclination angles
FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  with FORMULA  range. The
cross-sectional radius of the accretion column is fixed at FORMULA . We
investigate the effect of varying the column width in section 3.3.
Figure FORMULA  shows the temperature, velocity and density profiles
of an accretion column for an mCV with WD mass FORMULA  and
FORMULA , for cases where the ratio of cyclotron to bremsstrahlung
cooling at the shock is FORMULA  0, 10, and 100. The temperature
decreases monotonically from a shock temperature FORMULA  (FORMULA ), to a small finite value at the base of the column
(FORMULA ).The mass density in the post-shock region is determined by
FORMULA  and is a minimum at the shock and
reaches a maximum at the base of the column. The bulk velocity of the
accreting material at the shock is FORMULA  and decreases to zero at the base
of the column, where the plasma settles on the WD surface.
Figures REF  and REF  show the simulated line spectra for the case
where cyclotron cooling is negligible and bremsstrahlung cooling dominates
(FORMULA ). Figure REF  shows the simulated profiles
for FORMULA  and FORMULA  when cyclotron cooling
dominates bremsstrahlung (FORMULA ). In these cases, the
neutral Fe KFORMULA  line is emitted at the WD surface (FORMULA ), where
the bulk velocity is approximately zero and the thermal velocity of the plasma
is small. The 6.675 keV Fe KFORMULA  line is emitted from the lowest few
percent of the column (FORMULA ) where the velocity of the infalling
material and the thermal electron velocity are still relatively small. These
lines thus show very little Doppler broadening. The 6.97 keV line, however,
is emitted much closer to the shock (FORMULA ), in regions where the
temperature of the accreting material is considerably higher and thus suffers
more substantial Doppler broadening {{cite:4b091113-6299-43e3-85ce-9915318cafe2}}.
The simulated line spectra for the case where the accretion column radius is
fixed at FORMULA  is shown in Figure REF .
Figure REF  shows the simulated profiles for the case where the
line photon injection along the flow is specified according to the emissivity
profile model of {{cite:4b091113-6299-43e3-85ce-9915318cafe2}}. In figure REF  we compare our
simulated line spectra with an observation of the mCV GK Per detected by
Chandra/HETGS.
Table REF  shows a comparison of the FWHM of the Fe KFORMULA  lines for
FORMULA  and FORMULA  with low and high FORMULA  and
for FORMULA  and FORMULA .
No Cyclotron Cooling
FIGURE 
FIGURE 
TABLE 
When cyclotron cooling is negligible (FORMULA ), the 6.4, 6.675
and 6.97 keV lines are mostly emitted at heights above the WD surface of
FORMULA , 0 and FORMULA  for FORMULA  and
FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA  for
FORMULA , respectively {{cite:4b091113-6299-43e3-85ce-9915318cafe2}}. Note that Doppler broadening
is most significant for the 6.97 keV line which is emitted further up in
warmer regions of the post-shock column. Figures FORMULA  and FORMULA 
show that in all cases, there is substantial Compton broadening near the base
of the line profiles due to scatterings in the post-shock region where photons
may lose and gain energy. For example, for the 6.4 keV line emerging at
FORMULA  in Fig. REF a, the Compton broadened wings contain
FORMULA  of the total line photons. The blue wing extends up to
FORMULA  0.09 keV above the line centroid, while the red wing extends
down to FORMULA  0.16 keV (see Appendix). Compton features are
generally more prominent at higher accretion rates since this gives higher
optical depths in the column and hence, a higher scattering probability. For
comparison, the average number of scatterings per photon in the FORMULA  case is 0.5 but this increases to 2 in the FORMULA  case.
For FORMULA  (Fig. REF ), a recoil tail redward of the line
centroid can be seen in the cases FORMULA  and FORMULA  specifically
for high FORMULA  (Fig. REF b) The shock temperature for these cases is
FORMULA  keV, while for the FORMULA  case, the
shock temperature is much higher (FORMULA  for low
FORMULA  and FORMULA  keV for high FORMULA ). The plasma
temperature in the 1.0 FORMULA  case is too high to produce any downscattering
features and a large FORMULA  (small FORMULA ) has an accretion column with a lower
optical depth, hence the absence of these features in Fig. REF . Again the
downscattering features are more enhanced in the high FORMULA  cases since the
optical depth is higher (c.f. Figs. REF a and REF b for
FORMULA ). Note also that the 6.97 keV line centre is Doppler shifted
slightly redward which is most noticeable for the 0.5 FORMULA  case.
In addition to the recoil signatures, upscattering features are also seen in
the line spectra for the high FORMULA  cases (Figs. REF b and REF b)
when FORMULA . For these inclination angles, photons emerge from the
column with a final scattering angle cosine FORMULA .
Equation REF  then gives
FORMULA 
Since head on collisions (FORMULA ) have a higher probability,
FORMULA . The upscattering features are more prominent in
Fig. REF b than in Fig. REF b because the shock temperature, and
hence FORMULA , is higher. The sharpness of the upscattering features seen in
the 6.4 keV profiles in particular can be attributed to the maximum possible
energy gain when FORMULA  and to very few hot electrons with energies
beyond a few standard deviations of the mean thermal (Maxwellian) energy.
Scattering features are less prominent in the low FORMULA  cases
(Figs. REF a and REF a), since the overall optical depth is smaller.
For FORMULA  and FORMULA  for instance, the optical
depth across the column at the shock is FORMULA , which is a factor
10 smaller than that for the FORMULA  case (since FORMULA ). For higher WD masses (i.e. smaller FORMULA ), the
optical depth across the column is smaller, so fewer photons are scattered,
especially for low FORMULA  cases. This explains the difference in scattering
features in the profiles shown in Figs. REF  and REF  (in particular,
the high FORMULA , FORMULA  cases).
Photons observed at an inclination angle of FORMULA  propagate through the
entire length of the column before escaping. These photons propagate through a
thick section of cold pre-shock flow and can thus downscatter, resulting in
broadening redward of the line centre. However, the electron number density,
and hence, optical depth, in the pre-shock flow is small so recoil effects
are correspondingly small. Furthermore, fewer photons are detected at
FORMULA  because the solid angle centered around FORMULA  is
considerably smaller than that centered around larger inclination angles.

Cyclotron Cooling Dominated Flows
FIGURE 
Figure FORMULA  shows the profiles of Fe KFORMULA  lines emitted from
mCVs with FORMULA  and FORMULA  where FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and the ratio of cyclotron to bremsstrahlung cooling at the
shock is FORMULA . Also plotted is the thermal Doppler
broadened line profile before scattering (dotted curve). The additional cooling
of the plasma in the post-shock flow enhances the density and results in larger
scattering optical depths. Because the electron temperature of the shock-heated
region decreases as FORMULA  increases, the peak emissivities of the
6.675 keV and 6.97 keV Fe lines are found at larger
values of FORMULA , as can be seen in Fig. REF , which shows the
temperature, density and velocity profiles for different cases of
FORMULA . The additional cyclotron cooling results in a decrease in
the electron temperature and bulk velocity in the post-shock column at a fixed
FORMULA .
For FORMULA , the 6.4, 6.675 and 6.97 keV lines are emitted
from heights above the WD surface of FORMULA  0, FORMULA  and
FORMULA  cm for FORMULA , and FORMULA  0, 0 and
FORMULA  cm for FORMULA , respectively {{cite:4b091113-6299-43e3-85ce-9915318cafe2}}. The
emission height of the 6.97 keV line is significantly higher than in the
FORMULA  case and consequently, thermal Doppler broadening is
more prominent. The additional cooling in the accretion column also results in
a lower plasma temperature at the base of the column, FORMULA 
(see Fig. REF ), near where irradiation of neutral iron occurs and
the fluorescent 6.4 keV line is emitted. This line thus undergoes less thermal
Doppler broadening than in the FORMULA  case. As a result of
Compton scattering, the line profiles show additional broadening and recoil
tails redward of the line centre (Fig. REF b). Upscattering features
are also evident in the 6.4 and 6.675 keV lines especially for FORMULA  (Fig. REF a).
Overall, Compton scattering features are more prominent for cyclotron cooling
dominated accretion columns, especially for high accretion rates. For photons
viewed at FORMULA , upscattering and recoil features that are only
marginally seen in the FORMULA  case are considerably more
pronounced in the FORMULA  case. Thus, we expect Compton scattering
features to be most conspicuous in Fe KFORMULA  lines emitted in strongly
magnetized mCVs accreting at a high rate.

Effect of Accretion Column Radius
FIGURE 
The width of the accretion column in mCVs is poorly known and may vary
significantly from system to system. In the results presented so far, we have
fixed the accretion column radius to be FORMULA . Here, we investigate the
effect of relaxing this assumption. Figure REF  shows the
resulting profiles of Fe KFORMULA  lines emitted from two mCVs of different
masses (FORMULA  and FORMULA ) but with the same
absolute accretion column radius of FORMULA . This
corresponds to FORMULA  for the FORMULA  case
(Fig. REF a) and FORMULA  for the FORMULA  case
(Fig. REF b). The other parameters used to produce the profiles
are the same as those used for Fig. REF , namely
FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Fig. REF  shows that the changes in the accretion column width
generally result in changes near the base of the line profiles, which is
broadened by multiple scatterings. The effect of increasing (decreasing) the
width of the accretion column is to increase (decrease) the overall scattering
optical depth.
The Thompson optical depth across the base of the accretion column is
FORMULA  for the FORMULA  case (Fig. REF a) and
FORMULA  for the FORMULA  case (Fig. REF b). In
comparison, the Thompson optical depth across the column base for the same
lines when the column has a width of FORMULA  (dotted curves in
Fig. REF ) are FORMULA  for FORMULA  and
FORMULA  for FORMULA .
Fig. REF  indicates that due to the nonlinear nature of multiple
scatterings in the accretion column, particularly near the base, small changes
in optical depth associated with the accretion column geometry can result in
significant changes in line profiles. These changes mostly effect the base of
the line profiles.

Emissivity Profile Effects
FIGURE 
Realistically, the photon source regions are determined by an emissivity
profile along the post-shock region of the accretion column. In the results
presented so far, all the photons were injected at a single height in the
accretion column corresponding to the location of the peak in the emissivity
profile, as calculated by {{cite:4b091113-6299-43e3-85ce-9915318cafe2}}. Here, we investigate the effect of
spreading the photon injection site over a finite range of heights in the
post-shock region according to the calculated emissivity profiles.
Only the 6.675 keV and the 6.97 keV line are studied in this manner since much
of the fluorescence 6.4 keV yield derives from beneath the column, where X-ray
irradiation is strongest so the injection site is always at the base of the
column. Figure REF  shows an example of the emissivity profile
effect for the 6.675 keV and 6.97 keV Fe KFORMULA  lines emitted in an mCV with
FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA . The dotted curves show the corresponding profiles for the case where
photons are injected at a single height (where the emissivity peaks) for the
same mCV parameters. These profiles are the same as those shown in
Fig. REF a for the FORMULA  case (middle panel).
The line profiles calculated using a realistic emissivity profile (solid curves
in Fig. REF ) show some additional smearing, particularly redward
of the line centre, compared to the single injection site case (dotted curves
in Fig. REF ). This can be attributed to a small fraction of
photons now being emitted from regions closer to the shock, where the
temperature is FORMULA  and the flow speed is
FORMULA . Thus, these photons are more affected by
Doppler effects than other photons emitted from regions further away from the
shock. The small smearing redward of the line centre is therefore due to a
combination of Doppler shift and thermal broadening. The effect is not
prominent because only a small fraction of photons are emitted close to the
shock, as predicted by the emissivity profile {{cite:4b091113-6299-43e3-85ce-9915318cafe2}}. The FWHM for the
6.675 keV and 6.97 keV line is FORMULA  8 eV and FORMULA  9 eV respectively.
This corresponds to an additional broadening of approximately 25% for the
6.675 keV line and 11% for the 6.97 keV line.

Comparison with Observations
FIGURE 
Chandra/HETGS observations of a number of mCVs were reported by
{{cite:fdf1c78c-962b-4444-b0c6-f7331f43c1dc}}. The highest signal-to-noise spectrum was obtained in two
observations of the mCV GK Per during its 2002 outburst. This system is
classified as an intermediate polar (IP); the WD accretor is thought to have a
magnetic field of FORMULA  {{cite:fdf1c78c-962b-4444-b0c6-f7331f43c1dc}}, and a mass of
FORMULA  {{cite:0ad70cef-669c-401f-a64a-8e36601701e6}}. Its typical X-ray
luminosity in the FORMULA  keV bandpass is FORMULA  {{cite:5e25218d-88b2-490b-9752-1843d75b3a17}}, which places a lower limit on
the specific mass accretion rate, FORMULA  (adopting
FORMULA , inferred using the {{cite:ded1c1de-3429-4e32-94d0-e5977f7d9798}}
mass-radius relation, and assuming that accretion proceeds onto a fraction
FORMULA  of the WD surface area; see e.g. {{cite:44951882-925c-4148-a701-b72ca85e5dba}}).
Here we present a pilot study of GK Per and produce a simple comparison
between the profiles of the simulated and observed spectra. A more detailed
analysis of the data is left for future study.
The summed first-order HETGS spectrum from the 2002 Chandra
observations of GK Per is shown in Figure REF . The He-like and
fluorescence Fe KFORMULA  lines are detected, and there is a possible
excess at the expected energy for the H-like line at 6.97 keV. Also shown in
Fig. REF  are the upper and lower mass simulated HETGS spectra from a
10 ks Chandra observation of an mCV with parameters appropriate for
GK Per: an upper mass of FORMULA  with FORMULA , a lower mass of FORMULA  with FORMULA  and for both masses FORMULA  and FORMULA . We adopted inclination angles averaged
over an orbital period of GK Per (FORMULA )
{{cite:1795e75d-63f0-44eb-8884-3f67f1dfbb9c}}. We also added a normalized bremsstrahlung continuum with an
electron temperature FORMULA  {{cite:5e25218d-88b2-490b-9752-1843d75b3a17}}.
The measured equivalent widths of the 6.4, 6.675 and 6.97 keV lines in the
Chandra/HETGS spectra of GK Per are 260, 117 and 80 eV, respectively.
The relative strength of the lines in the simulated spectra is fixed by the
number of photons used in each simulation and the assumed continuum flux level.
We used FORMULA  photons for all three lines, so that their relative strengths
are comparable. We intend to relax this condition in future work. There is a
remarkable similarity between the observed and the simulated spectra for the
6.4 keV line in particular. Realistically, the actual strengths of the 6.675
and 6.97 keV lines depend on the ionisation structure of the flow
{{cite:4b091113-6299-43e3-85ce-9915318cafe2}}, since this determines the emissivity of the lines. The H-like and
He-like lines are thus potentially powerful diagnostic tools that can be used
to deduce the physical properties of the post-shock accretion column in mCVs.
The 6.4 keV line strength, on the other hand, depends on the flux of the
illuminating X-rays, which is largest near the WD surface. Fluorescent lines
may also be produced in the surface atmospheric region around the accretion
column {{cite:fdf1c78c-962b-4444-b0c6-f7331f43c1dc}}, and this may contribute to the observed equivalent
width of the 6.4 keV line.
The observed fluorescent line in GK Per exhibits a red wing extending to
6.33 keV which {{cite:fdf1c78c-962b-4444-b0c6-f7331f43c1dc}} attribute to Doppler shifts. In general we
find that bulk Doppler shifts have a negligible effect on Fe KFORMULA  lines.
Our simulated spectra show a weaker red wing arising from downscatterings near
the base of the accretion column. The observed spectrum also exhibits a
shoulder extending 170 eV redward of the 6.4 keV line centre, which
{{cite:fdf1c78c-962b-4444-b0c6-f7331f43c1dc}} suggest may be due to Compton downscattering. Our
simulations confirm that recoil can indeed affect the fluorescent line when it
is emitted at the base of the accretion column, although in our spectra
(Fig. REF ) there is no clear evidence that recoil extends down to
170 eV redward of the 6.4 keV line.

Summary and Conclusion
We have investigated line distortion and broadening effects due to Compton
scattering in the accretion column of mCVs using a nonlinear Monte Carlo
technique that takes into account the nonuniform temperature, velocity and
density profiles of the post-shock column. Scattered Fe KFORMULA  lines were
simulated for a range of different physical parameters: white dwarf mass,
accretion rate, magnetic field strength and inclination angle. The photon
source regions in the post-shock flow were determined from the ionization
structure and the effects due to the bulk velocity Doppler shift and thermal
broadening are also considered.
We find that line profiles are most affected by Compton scattering in the cases
of low white dwarf mass, high specific mass accretion rate, strong cyclotron
cooling and oblique inclination angles. Both a lower white dwarf mass (or
equivalently a larger white dwarf radius) and a higher accretion rate result in
a higher optical depth, hence more pronounced scattering effects. Strong
cyclotron cooling associated with a high magnetic field strength results in a
higher density in the post-shock flow and hence, a correspondingly larger
optical depth. Recoil signatures are evident for oblique viewing angles
when cyclotron cooling becomes important. These are due to scatterings near the
base of the flow, where both the dynamical and thermal velocities are small.
Sharp upscattering features are also seen in the line profiles for large
viewing angles. These upscattering features are attributed to head-on
collisions with hot electrons near the shock. Photons emitted close to the
shock in the accretion column display more thermal Doppler broadening. This is
generally the case for the Fe XXVI 6.97 keV line. The Fe
6.4 keV and Fe XXV 6.675 keV lines are generally emitted at
or near the base of the accretion column respectively, and show a relatively
small amount of thermal Doppler broadening. Bulk velocity induced Doppler
shifts are negligible compared with scattering.
We also investigated the effects of dispersing the 6.675 and 6.97 keV line
photons using an emissivity calculated self-consistently from the
ionization structure of the post-shock column. We find that, compared to
injecting the line photons at a single height where the emissivity peaks,
using an emissivity profile does not significantly change the overall profiles
of the 6.675 and 6.97 keV lines. The resulting line profiles show a small
degree of smearing redward of the line center due to additional dynamical and
thermal Doppler effects associated with a small fraction of line photons
emitted close to the shock. The effect is most important for the 6.675 keV
line. We estimate a fractional increase in the FWHM of no more than
FORMULA  25%.
In general, our simulations predict that recoil in scattering with cool
electrons near the base of the column as well as upscattering by hot electrons
near the shock can imprint signatures on the profile of lines emitted near the
base of the flow. Such Compton signatures may thus be used to determine the
primary source region of the fluorescent line. We predict that when 6.4 keV
photons are emitted in the dense, cool plasma at the base of the accretion
column, they can suffer strong downscattering when propagating through the
electrons streaming downward in the flow. The scattering probability is
governed by the effective scattering optical depth, which increases with the
mass accretion rate of the system.
We convolved simulations with the Chandra response function and
compared them to Chandra/HETGS observations of GK Per. Our results
indicate that the red wing seen in the 6.4 keV line in GK Per could be
attributed to Compton recoil near the base of the flow.
Finally we remark that tighter constraints on the dynamics and flow
geometry in magnetized accreting compact objects can be obtained by considering
the polarization properties of the lines {{cite:ef8964bb-776f-43f1-b97c-04068c984829}}, {{cite:3d69c324-ed8f-470d-b507-45d44a8e749b}}. There is
currently considerable effort to develop X-ray polarimeters which can detect
degrees of polarization of the order of one percent {{cite:247b2143-5db4-49e4-9a16-bfe0aa5c4b8f}}. The spectral
resolution of these detectors should be adequate to search for different
polarization degrees in emission iron lines. It is possible to include a
polarization treatment in our calculations, but the computational algorithm in
our Monte Carlo code will need to be revised, which we leave for a future
study.

The width of the Compton shoulder
Here, we derive an estimate for the width of the prominent wings near the base
of the line profiles. Let the accretion flow be along the FORMULA -axis and consider
an observer on the FORMULA  plane. Let FORMULA  be the line-of-sight inclination angle
of the accretion column, and let FORMULA  be the local velocity of the flow,
normalized to the speed of light FORMULA , which can expressed as
FORMULA 
The normalized vector of a scattered photon of energy FORMULA  propagating in the
direction to the observer is
FORMULA 
Suppose that the normalized vector of the incident photon, with energy FORMULA , is
FORMULA 
Then the change in energy of the photon, after scattering with an
electron in the flow, due to bulk motion is given by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA  .
In terms of the viewing inclination angle and the photon propagation vectors,
FORMULA 
Then for FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
It follows that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA .
The maximum energy downshift is caused by the recoil process when the photons
are scattered by “cold” electrons (with FORMULA ). This occurs
when FORMULA , FORMULA , which yields
FORMULA 
This result is practically independent of the WD mass and the viewing
inclination angle.
For the 6.4 keV line, FORMULA .
The maximum energy upshift is caused by a Doppler shift when the photons are
scattered by the fastest available downstream electrons (i.e. FORMULA  is no
longer a negligible factor). The condition for its occurrence can be derived as
follows. Set
FORMULA 
which gives two conditions for extrema with respect to the azimuthal
coordinate: FORMULA  and FORMULA , corresponding respectively to
FORMULA 
Differentiating the above expression with respect to FORMULA  and setting the
resulting expression to zero yields the following condition for the extrema:
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
The first case (FORMULA ) leads to a maximum energy upshift, which requires
FORMULA 
At the viewing inclination angle FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
Hence, the maximum energy upshift is given by
FORMULA 
If we assume that the maximum FORMULA  takes the free-fall velocity at the
WD surface, then FORMULA  is simply the reciprocal of the square root of the
WD radius in the Schwarzschild unit, i.e. FORMULA . For FORMULA , FORMULA , and for
FORMULA , FORMULA  (assuming the Nauenberg
mass-radius relation {{cite:ded1c1de-3429-4e32-94d0-e5977f7d9798}}), this gives FORMULA  and FORMULA  respectively for the 6.4 keV line.
The Compton shoulder of an Fe line is due to a single scattering event.
For the 6.4 keV line, the broadening extends over FORMULA  for a 1.0 FORMULA  WD and FORMULA  for a 0.5 FORMULA  WD (omitting thermal broadening and flow
Doppler broadening), when viewed at FORMULA .
