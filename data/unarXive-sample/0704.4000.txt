Physics Department, Middle East Technical University Ankara, TurkeyWe study the radiative lepton flavor violating FORMULA  decays in the two Higgs doublet model, respecting the
Randall Sundrum scenario and estimate the contributions of the KK
modes of left (right) handed charged lepton doublets (singlets) on
the branching ratios. We observe that the branching ratios are
sensitive to the contributions of the charged lepton KK modes.



Introduction
The flavor violation (FV) is among the most interesting physical
phenomena to search the standard model (SM) and its beyond. The
lepton FV is worthwhile to study since the leptonic decays are
clean and rich from the theoretical point of view. They are clean
because of the fact that they are free from strong interactions.
On the other hand, they are rich since they exist at least in the
loop level. The lepton FV is tiny in the extended SM, with non
zero neutrino masses and the theoretical branching ratios (BRs) of
lepton flavor violating (LFV) decays are too small to reach the
experimental limits. Therefore, one needs to search more
fundamental models to pull the theoretical values to the current
experimental results. The radiative FORMULA ,
FORMULA  decays are among the LFV interactions and the current
experimental upper limits of the BRs of the decays FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA , read FORMULA  {{cite:b099dcdb-64ec-49a2-93e3-bfd6b9f2e4a9}}, FORMULA  {{cite:cc46cdcf-d5be-483d-ae61-8e3a3e9d2836}} and FORMULA 
{{cite:1551e95a-d827-437f-aab7-5f3bf3437a95}} ({{cite:ecde35ee-1677-4ee4-8c4c-5fb483a81000}}; {{cite:3082fecc-c3c9-44bb-8c5e-2b0f1984994d}}), respectively.
Furthermore, a new experiment at PSI has been described
{{cite:b2757077-490c-4aa6-b19e-87d07d4ef2c0}} in order to search the FORMULA 
decay and the aim is to reach to a sensitivity of BRFORMULA . At present, this experiment (PSI-R-99-05 Experiment) is
still running in the MEG {{cite:fee75cb4-8650-47a9-9116-998aabd17810}}.
The general two Higgs doublet model (2HDM) with the flavor
changing neutral currents (FCNCs) at tree level is the most
primitive model beyond the SM to enhance the BRs of the LFV decays
under consideration and the lepton FV is induced by the internal
new neutral Higgs bosons, FORMULA  and FORMULA . The Yukawa couplings
appear as free parameters and they can be determined by the
experimental data. These decays were examined in the framework of
the 2HDM in {{cite:6df9d5a5-d9c7-442f-9c1a-1822dfda22e1}}, {{cite:cde676c2-056a-47f8-befb-6d6c3a4150cd}}, {{cite:ba86c7e0-1624-4bae-8d23-b9b21c996e7d}}, {{cite:b483a8a1-b681-4143-9abc-266a0a004eb8}}, {{cite:705e0a57-73bd-493a-b9f3-1a1c7e4cf92a}}, {{cite:a383827a-80ff-440f-87d4-cc20bf557d31}}, {{cite:93c85ace-5577-4d39-9ca9-da1872481930}}.
Besides the theoretical calculations based on the 2HDM, they were
studied in the supersymmetric models
{{cite:35f3063d-1bc4-4443-8871-512f55286e4c}}-{{cite:910b8122-810b-4b63-8df8-b2ea8e101554}}, in a model independent way
{{cite:e4cb4dc7-ad98-4549-901b-28e481baf046}} and, recently, they were analyzed in the framework of
2HDM and the supersymmetric model {{cite:cc308f60-60db-4364-bb59-d9edd97b412b}}.
The present work is devoted to the analysis of the radiative
FORMULA , FORMULA  decays in the
2HDMHere, we assume that the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa
(CKM) type matrix in the leptonic sector does not exist, the
charged flavor changing (FC) interactions vanish and the lepton FV
comes from the internal new neutral Higgs bosons, FORMULA  and
FORMULA ., including a single extra dimension, respecting the
Randall Sundrum scenario {{cite:795ccedf-a15c-4377-995b-f4d4e61a3ed2}}, {{cite:fb08033a-20fa-4e48-98b2-8fe83e3b4c57}}. The extra dimensions are
introduced to solve the hierarchy problem between weak and Planck
scales. The Randall Sundrum model (the RS1 model) is based on the
non-factorizable geometry of the extra dimension that the gravity
is localized on a 4D brane boundary, so called hidden (Planck)
brane, and the other fields, including the SM fields, live on
another 4D brane boundary, so called the visible (TeV) brane. The
difference of induced metrics on these boundaries are carried by a
warp factor that is an exponential function of the compactified
radius in the extra dimension and it connects two effective
scales, the Planck scale FORMULA  and the weak scale FORMULA . In the
case that some of the SM fields are accessible to the extra
dimension, the phenomenology becomes richer and there are various
work done respecting such scenarios in the literature
{{cite:810ca873-571d-4278-a061-4248dcc2ac3c}}-{{cite:355065d3-96a2-4032-9d2f-e568494fa1dd}}. In {{cite:d1988b84-d2b0-44cd-b10e-99a2cb57cc43}}, {{cite:9666cc15-557a-45c0-bde2-675e35e588bb}} the
behavior of FORMULA  gauge boson, living in the extra dimension of
the RS1 background, has been studied. In these works, it is
observed that the massless mode of the gauge field is not
localized in the extra dimension and its KK excitations have large
couplings to boundaries. Since it is necessary to push the visible
scale to energies greater than TeV for a perturbative theory, this
is not a phenomenologically favorable scenario. The brane
localized mass terms for scalar fields have been considered to get
small couplings of KK modes with the boundaries {{cite:c2d81080-d201-487e-ae58-e76725aae135}}.
In this case, these mass terms change the boundary conditions and
the zero mode localized solution is obtained. {{cite:e9285db7-e0cc-47f6-a06e-8ddc7a4996ac}} is
devoted to the localized FORMULA  gauge field with bulk and
boundary mass terms. In {{cite:9058a96c-f166-477d-b98f-d9819ad64b3e}}, the KK excitations of W and
Z bosons at the LHC are studied. A further approach is to consider
that the fermions are also accessible to the extra dimension and
to explain the fermion mass hierarchy with the addition of Dirac
mass term to the Lagrangian. The bulk fermions are considered in
the RS1 background and the fermion mass hierarchy, coming from the
possible fermion field locations, is studied in {{cite:c2d81080-d201-487e-ae58-e76725aae135}}, {{cite:502bfc9f-87b5-412d-a6a2-3896f0a86fe3}}, {{cite:54c65116-b39a-4fc0-81f7-0ba85f70c262}}, {{cite:8f35abce-94e8-4c52-a188-96d2cbf090df}}. In {{cite:a033796e-cfa1-4bd6-8a95-a4796f24e190}} this hierarchy is
analyzed, by taking that the Higgs field has an exponential
profile around the TeV brane. {{cite:524f6f0a-438a-450c-9fca-2dbef1e01fa0}} is devoted to an
extensive work on the bulk fields in various multi-brane models.
The quark and lepton FV, which is based on the different locations
of the fermion fields in the extra dimension, is extensively
studied in {{cite:581d381a-7d4d-4cbb-83fe-746225146a7e}}, {{cite:13457bfd-4128-4efc-99c9-5b66cb239ba5}} and in these works, it is
considered that the FV is carried by the Yukawa interactions,
coming from the SM Higgs-fermion-fermion vertices. In {{cite:3a66f5a1-117d-4cf3-9a0e-4929cb3653ed}},
the high precision measurements of top pair production at the ILC
is addressed by considering that the fermions are localized in
the bulk of RS1 background. In recent works {{cite:d39ba008-7854-4767-b14e-aef6ad45e0a8}}, {{cite:355065d3-96a2-4032-9d2f-e568494fa1dd}}, the various experimental FCNC constraints and the
electro weak precision tests for the location parameters of the
fermions in the extra dimension are discussed.
In this work, we study the LFV FORMULA  decays
in the RS1 background with the assumption that the leptons and
gauge fields are accessible to the extra dimension. Furthermore,
we consider that the lepton fields are localized in the extra
dimension and their mass hierarchy is based on the lepton field
location in the extra dimension.
The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we present the
BRs of LFV interactions FORMULA  in the 2HDM, by
considering that the lepton fields are localized in the extra
dimension of RS1 background. Section 3 is devoted to discussion
and our conclusions.

LFV FORMULA  decays in the Randall
Sundrum background with localized lepton fields
The radiative LFV decays exist in the loop level and, therefore,
the theoretical expressions of their physical quantities contain
number of free parameters of the model used. The theoretical work
done on these decays ensures considerable information on the
parameters of the model, with the help of the experimental
measurements. In the framework of the SM, the numerical values of
the BRs of these decays are far from experimental limits. This
forces one to consider new models beyond the SM and the 2HDM, with
the FCNCs at tree level, is one of the candidate. The new neutral
Higgs bosons in the 2HDM switch on the LFV interactions and the
new Yukawa couplings, arising from lepton-lepton-scalar
interactions, play the main role in the calculation of the
physical quantities related to these decays.
Addition of the contributions coming from the extra dimension(s)
further enhances the BRs of the decays studied and, in the
present work, we study these effects in the RS1 background, by
assuming that the charged leptons and the gauge bosons are
accessible to the extra dimension. In the RS1 model, the extra
dimension is curved and the metric reads
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  is the bulk curvature constant. Here
the exponential FORMULA , with FORMULA , is the warp
factorThe warp factor causes that all mass terms are
rescaled on the visible brane for FORMULA . that is
responsible for the hierarchy and FORMULA  is the compactification
radius in the extra dimension that is compactified onto FORMULA 
orbifold, having two boundaries, the hidden (Planck) brane and the
visible (TeV) brane. In the RS1 background, the gravity is
considered to be localized on the hidden brane and to be extended
into the bulk with varying strength, on the other hand, the SM
fields live in the visible brane. By choosing opposite and equal
tensions on the hidden and visible branes, the low energy
effective theory has flat 4D spacetime, even if the 5D
cosmological constant is non vanishing. In the present work, we
assume that the gauge fields and the fermions are also accessible
to the extra dimension. The addition of Dirac mass term to the
lagrangian of bulk fermions results in the fermion localization in
the extra dimension {{cite:0d7f92ba-e55d-4eb2-b9f5-05e1cfb4b758}}, {{cite:9666cc15-557a-45c0-bde2-675e35e588bb}}, {{cite:c2d81080-d201-487e-ae58-e76725aae135}}, {{cite:9058a96c-f166-477d-b98f-d9819ad64b3e}}, {{cite:502bfc9f-87b5-412d-a6a2-3896f0a86fe3}}, {{cite:8f35abce-94e8-4c52-a188-96d2cbf090df}}, {{cite:a033796e-cfa1-4bd6-8a95-a4796f24e190}}. Since the fermions have two possible
transformation properties under the orbifold FORMULA  symmetry,
FORMULA , the combination FORMULA  is
odd and, in order to construct the FORMULA  invariant mass term, one
needs FORMULA  odd scalar field to be coupled. Therefore, the mass
term reads
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  with
FORMULA  and
FORMULA , FORMULA . By expanding the
bulk fermion as
FORMULA 
and using the normalization
FORMULA 
the Dirac equation is solved for the zero mode fermion and it is
obtained as follows:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and the normalization constant FORMULA  reads
FORMULA 
The appropriately normalized solution
FORMULA 
is localized in the extra dimension and the localization is
regulated by the parameter FORMULA . This solution is localized near
the hidden (visible) brane if FORMULA  (FORMULA )
and it has a constant profile if FORMULA .
To construct the SM fermions, one needs to consider FORMULA 
doublet FORMULA  and singlet FORMULA  with separate FORMULA 
projection conditions: FORMULA  and
FORMULA  (see for example {{cite:0d7f92ba-e55d-4eb2-b9f5-05e1cfb4b758}}). This
is the case that the zero mode fermions can get mass through the
FORMULA  invariant left handed fermion-right handed fermion-Higgs
interaction,  FORMULAHere, we
consider different location parameters FORMULA  for each left handed
and right handed part of different flavors. and the location
parameters for fermion fields, different flavors and their left
and right handed parts, can be chosen so that this interaction
creates the current masses of fermions. With the assumption that
the Higgs field lives on the visible brane, the masses of fermions
are calculated by using the integral
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the coupling in five dimensions and it can be
parametrized in terms of the one in four dimensions, the
dimensionless coupling FORMULA , FORMULA .
Here the expectation value of the Higgs field FORMULA  reads
FORMULA  where FORMULA  is the vacuum expectation
valueWe take FORMULA  to provide the measured
gauge boson masses {{cite:8f35abce-94e8-4c52-a188-96d2cbf090df}} and choose FORMULA  in order
to get the correct effective scale on the visible brane, i.e.,
FORMULA  is of the order of TeV.. Now, we
choose three different sets of location of charged lepton fields
in order to obtain the masses of different flavors.
TABLE 
In Set I, the left and right handed fields of the same flavor have
the same location. In set II and III, we choose the left handed
charged lepton locations the same for each flavor and we estimate
the left handed charged lepton locations by respecting their
masses. Notice that, in the third set, we take the left handed
charged lepton locations nearer to the visible brane.
Now we would like to present the part of the action responsible
for the LFV interactions in 5 dimension:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  denote chiral projections FORMULA , FORMULA  is the new scalar doublet, FORMULA  (FORMULA ) are lepton doublets (singlets), FORMULA , with
family indices FORMULA  , are the Yukawa couplings in five dimensions
,which induce the FV interactions in the leptonic sector. We
assume that the Higgs doublet FORMULA , that lives on the visible
brane, has non-zero vacuum expectation value to ensure the
ordinary masses of the gauge fields and the fermions, however, the
second doublet, that lies also on the visible brane, has no vacuum
expectation value:
FORMULA 
and the vacuum expectation values are
FORMULA 
By considering the gauge and FORMULA  invariant Higgs potential which
spontaneously breaks FORMULA  down to FORMULA  as:
FORMULA 
with constants FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  are obtained
as the mass eigenstates FORMULA  and FORMULA  respectively, since no
mixing occurs between two CP-even neutral bosons FORMULA  and FORMULA 
in the tree level. With the choice eq.(REF ) and the
potential eq.(REF ), the SM particles can be collected
in the first doublet and the new particles in the second
oneIn the case that the second Higgs doublet has also a
vacuum expectation value, there would be a mixing between the CP
even neutral Higgs bosons and there appears an additional free
parameter, the mixing angle, which should be restricted. In
general, this mixing is considered weak and, our choice of Higgs
doublets results in vanishing mixing between CP even neutral Higgs
bosons. This is the case that one free parameter is dropped
without loosing the crucial property of the model, namely, the FV
at tree level. Since the lepton fields are accesible to extra
dimension, the lepton doublets FORMULA  and singlets FORMULA 
are expanded as
FORMULA 
The zero mode leptons FORMULA  and FORMULA 
are given in eq. (REF ) with the replacements FORMULA  and FORMULA , respectively. For the effective
Yukawa coupling FORMULA , we need to integrate out the
Yukawa interaction eq.(REF ) over the fifth
dimension by taking the zero mode lepton doublets, singlets, and
neutral Higgs fields FORMULA :
FORMULA 
At this stage, we consider two different scenarios. At first, we
assume that the hierarchy of new Yukawa couplings comes from the
lepton field localization and, by considering that the left and
right handed fields of the same flavor have the same location (Set
I), we construct the Yukawa coupling FORMULA  and its
hermitian conjugate as follows:
FORMULA 
Here, we fix the new neutral Higgs FORMULA  coupling (renamed
as FORMULA ) in four dimensions, and we estimate the other
couplings, respecting the possible locations of the charged
leptons which are calculated by considering their mass
hierarchyThis case is similar to Sher anzats {{cite:da0a9d64-e007-482a-b069-ab2ce520978b}}
that the couplings are defined as  FORMULA. The idea behind is to consider the FORMULA 
coupling in four dimensions as non-zero in the case of FORMULA -charged
lepton-charged lepton interaction (zero for the case of SM
Higgs-charged lepton-charged lepton interaction since the off
diagonal entries of the SM Higgs-charged lepton-charged lepton
couplings in five dimensions vanish, in our choice) and it is
fixed by embedding the contribution coming from the mixing due to
the different locations of L(R) handed muon-R(L) handed
tauNotice that we choose FORMULA  for this case. into
the number FORMULA , with the choice of flavor dependent coupling
in five dimensions. In other words, the flavor dependence due to
the different locations of L(R) handed muon, R(L) handed tau is
compensated by the flavor dependence of the coupling in five
dimensions and, at the end, we get a fixed number FORMULA . As a
second scenario, we embed the vertex factor FORMULA 
into the coupling
FORMULA . In this case,
similar to the previous one, the coupling FORMULA  in
five dimension is flavor dependent and it is regulated in such a
way that the overall quantity FORMULA  is pointed to
the chosen numerical value of
FORMULA . In this
scenario, the hierarchy of new Yukawa couplings is not related to
the lepton field locations.
Furthermore, the strengths of FORMULA -KK mode charged lepton-charged
lepton couplings are regulated by the locations of the lepton
fields. In our second scenario, we use two different sets, Set II
and Set III, for the locations of the lepton fields. Notice that
in both scenarios, the FV is carried by the new Yukawa couplings
in four dimensions and the effect of extra dimension is the
enhancement in the physical quantities of the processes
studied.These scenarios are different than the ones
presented in the works {{cite:581d381a-7d4d-4cbb-83fe-746225146a7e}}, {{cite:13457bfd-4128-4efc-99c9-5b66cb239ba5}} where the sources
of the FV are explicitly the parameters related to the different
locations of the fermion fields in the extra dimension. In these
works, it is considered that the FV is carried by the Yukawa
interactions, coming from the SM Higgs-fermion-fermion vertices
with the help of the coupling in five dimensions, including
non-zero off diagonal entries.
Since the radiative LFV decays under consideration exist at least
in the one loop level, the FORMULA -charged lepton-KK charged lepton
vertices arise and these vertex factors should be taken into
account. The FORMULA  the projection condition FORMULA , used in constructing the left handed fields on the branes,
results in that the left handed zero mode appears, the left
(right) handed KK modes appear (disappear) on the branes, with the
boundary conditions due to the Dirac mass term in the action
eq.(REF ):
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  or FORMULA . Using the Dirac equation for KK mode
leptons one gets the left handed lepton FORMULA  that
lives on the visible brane as
FORMULA 
with the constant
FORMULA 
Here, FORMULA  is the normalization constant and
FORMULA . The functions FORMULA  and
FORMULA  appearing in eq.(REF ) are the Bessel
function of the first kind and of the second kind, respectively.
On the other hand, the FORMULA  projection condition
FORMULA  is used in order to construct the right
handed fields on the branes and this ensures that the right handed
zero mode appears, the right (left) handed KK modes appear
(disappear) on the branes with the boundary conditions:
FORMULA 
Again, using the Dirac equation for KK mode leptons, one gets the
right handed lepton FORMULA  that lives on the visible
brane as
FORMULA 
with
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the normalization constant and
FORMULA . Notice that the constant FORMULA , the
FORMULA  KK mode mass FORMULA  in eq.(REF ) and the
constant FORMULA , the FORMULA  KK mode mass FORMULA  in
eq.(REF ) are obtained by using the boundary conditions
eq.(REF ) and eq.(REF ), respectively. For
FORMULA  and FORMULA  they are approximated as:
FORMULA 
Now, we are ready to calculate the FORMULA -charged lepton-KK charged
lepton vertex factors, FORMULA , that appear in the
loop diagram (see Fig.REF ). The procedure is the
integration of the Yukawa interaction eq.(REF )
over the fifth dimension by taking the FORMULA -zero mode lepton
singlet (doublet)-KK mode lepton doublet (singlet)
FORMULA 
and we get
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  (FORMULA ) is given in eq.(REF ) (eq.(REF )) with
the replacements FORMULA  (FORMULA ). In
the first scenario that the hierarchy of new Yukawa couplings
comes from the lepton field location, the effective FORMULA -zero mode
lepton singlet (doublet)-KK mode lepton doublet (singlet) coupling
FORMULA  reads
FORMULA 
and, in the second scenario, we get
FORMULA 
At this stage, we present the BRs of the LFV FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  decays. The existence of decays at least in the one
loop level brings the logarithmic divergences in the calculations
and we eliminate them by using the on-shell renormalization
scheme. In this scheme, the self energy diagrams for on-shell
leptons vanish since they can be written as FORMULA  and
the vertex diagram in Fig.REF  gives non-zero
contribution.This is the case that the divergences can
be eliminated by introducing a counter term FORMULA  with the
relation FORMULA  where
FORMULA  (FORMULA ) is the renormalized (bare) vertex
and by using the gauge invariance: FORMULA .
Here, FORMULA  is the four momentum vector of the outgoing
photon.. Taking only tau lepton for the internal line
We take into account only the internal tau lepton
contribution since, in the second scenario, we respect the idea
that the couplings FORMULA  (FORMULA ), are
small compared to FORMULA  FORMULA ,
due to the possible proportionality of them to the masses of
leptons under consideration in the vertices. In the first
scenario, this idea is considered automatically. Here, we use the
dimensionful coupling FORMULA  with the definition
FORMULA  where N denotes the word "neutral"., the
decay width FORMULA  reads
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  or FORMULA  and the functions FORMULA , FORMULA  are given by
FORMULA 
Here FORMULA , FORMULA 
(FORMULA ) is the left (right) chiral amplitude,
FORMULA , FORMULA  with left (right) handed
internal lepton KK mode mass FORMULA  (eq.(REF )),
FORMULA  is the charge of tau lepton. Notice that we take the
Yukawa couplings real and ignore the mass FORMULA  FORMULA  for
FORMULA ; FORMULA 
(FORMULA ) decays.

Discussion
The radiative LFV FORMULA  interactions exist at
least in the one loop level in the 2HDM, with the help of the
Yukawa interactions coming from lepton-lepton-FORMULA  vertices. The
Yukawa couplings are free parameters which should be restricted by
using the current and forthcoming experiments. In the present
work, we study these decays in the RS1 background with the
assumption that the leptons are accessible to the extra dimension.
Furthermore, we choose the idea that the lepton fields are
localized in the extra dimension by considering a Dirac mass term
FORMULA  with FORMULA  (eq.(REF )). This
choice results in that the right and left handed lepton zero
modes, the SM leptons, have exponential profiles in the extra
dimension, given in eq.(REF ), and their different
locations can explain different flavor mass
hierarchy.There is another scenario, so called the split
fermion scenario, where the mass hierarchy comes from the
different locations of various flavors and their left and right
handed parts of lepton fields which have Gaussian profiles in the
flat extra dimensions. In this case, the localizations of fermions
can be obtained by coupling them to a scalar field having kink
profile, and the Gaussian profiles of leptons are obtained as an
approximation (see {{cite:de5d618d-77c0-4d26-b8d6-e1d185220a16}}, {{cite:5f04003f-73f3-439e-a683-f5b8c5c4afeb}} for details). Here we
choose three different set of locations of charged leptons in
order to obtain the masses of different flavors. Since we
consider that the leptons are accessible to the bulk, the gauge
sector of the model should live also in the extra dimension and
their KK modes appear after the compactification of the extra
dimension. The different fermion locations can induce additional
FCNC effects at tree level due to the couplings of neutral gauge
KK modes-leptons and they should be suppressed even for low KK
masses, by choosing the location parameters FORMULA  (FORMULA )
appropriately. In the set of location parameters we use (Table
REF ), we verify the various experimental FCNC constraints
with KK neutral gauge boson masses as low as few TeVs (see the
similar the set of location parameters and the discussion given in
{{cite:d39ba008-7854-4767-b14e-aef6ad45e0a8}}, {{cite:355065d3-96a2-4032-9d2f-e568494fa1dd}}). On the other hand, in our scenario,
since the FV is carried by the new Yukawa couplings which are
fixed to an appropriate number, respecting the current
measurements, the location parameters of leptons are responsible
for the lepton mass hierarcies and the strengths of FORMULA -zero mode
charged lepton-KK mode charged leptonvertices. Therefore, they do
not play a crucial role in the existence of the FV in the tree
level and the constraints coming from various LFV processes become
more relaxed.
In the first set (Table REF ), we consider the left and right
handed fields having the same location in the extra dimension.
This is the case that we construct the hierarchy of new Yukawa
couplings by fixing the FORMULA  coupling
FORMULA , which is renamed as FORMULA  in the
text. In the second and third set, we choose the left handed
charged lepton locations as the same for each flavor and we
estimate the right handed ones by respecting the charged lepton
masses. In the third set, we take the left handed charged lepton
locations near to the visible brane and we observe that the KK
mode charged lepton contribution to the BRs of the decays studied
increases. The reason behind this enhancement is that the KK mode
couplings to the new Higgs scalars, living on the visible brane,
become stronger if the left handed lepton field is near to this
brane. For the second and third set of locations, we embed the
results of integrals of the FORMULA -zero mode charged lepton-zero mode
charged lepton couplings into the Yukawa couplings of
corresponding vertices. In this case, we choose the Yukawa
couplings such that FORMULA  are
smaller compared to FORMULA ,
since latter ones contain heavy flavor and we assume that, in four
dimensions, the couplings FORMULA  is symmetric with
respect to the indices FORMULA  and FORMULA . Furthermore, the curvature
parameter FORMULA  and the compactification radius FORMULA  are the
additional free parameters of the theory. Here we take
FORMULA  and consider in the region FORMULA  (see the discussion in section 2 and
{{cite:8f35abce-94e8-4c52-a188-96d2cbf090df}}). Throughout our calculations we use the input
values given in Table (REF ).

In Figs.REF -REF -REF , we
present the parameter FORMULA  dependence of the BR of the LFV decay

values of the coupling FORMULA . In Fig. REF , the
solid (dashed, small dashed) line-curve represents the BR for
FORMULA  without -with the lepton KK modes.
In Figs.REF  and REF , the solid
(dashed, small dashed) line-curve represents the BR for
FORMULA  without -with the lepton KK modes,
similar to the previous figure. Fig.REF  shows that
the BR (FORMULA ) is at the order of the
magnitude of FORMULA  for FORMULA  and it is not sensitive to the parameter FORMULA  in
the given range. Here, the enhancement due to the additional
contribution coming from internal lepton KK modes is negligible.
The BR (FORMULA ) - BR (FORMULA ) is at the order of the magnitude of FORMULA  - FORMULA  for
FORMULA . For these decays the BR slightly
increases for the small values of FORMULA , FORMULA  and the
enhancement in the BR due to the lepton KK mode contributions is
almost FORMULA  - more than FORMULA . To obtain the BR of the decay
FORMULA  in the range FORMULA , the coupling FORMULA  should lie in the region FORMULA . On the other hand, this coupling should be in
the region FORMULA  for the case that the BR of the
decay FORMULA  (FORMULA )
with internal lepton KK modes has the numerical value lying in the
range FORMULA  (FORMULA ). These numerical values show that the idea of hierarchy
of Yukawa couplings based on the locations of charged leptons in
the bulk of RS1 background can not explain the present
experimental results of these LFV decays and this stimulates to
perform more accurate measurements.
Figs. REF -REF  are devoted to the
parameter FORMULA  dependence of the BR of the LFV FORMULA  decay for lepton location set II-III, for
FORMULA  and for different values of the
coupling FORMULA . Here, the solid (dashed,
small dashed) line-curve represents the BR for
FORMULA  without
-with the lepton KK modes. It is observed that the BR
(FORMULA ) is at the order of the magnitude of
FORMULA  for FORMULA  without the internal lepton KK mode
contributions. The addition of lepton KK modes bring considerable
enhancement, nearly FORMULA  one order (nearly two orders) for
set II (III), especially for the small values of the parameter
FORMULA . The larger enhancement in the case of set III is due to the
fact that the left handed leptons (zero and KK modes) are near to
the visible brane and their couplings to the new Higgs scalars,
living on the visible brane, become stronger. This is interesting
since it would be possible to enhance the BR by localizing the
lepton fields at appropriate points in the extra dimension, near
to the visible brane. Therefore, by choosing small values of
yukawa couplings, the experimental values of the BR of the LFV
decay under consideration could be reached.
Figs. REF -REF  represent the
parameter FORMULA  dependence of the BR of the LFV FORMULA  decay for lepton location set II-III, for
FORMULA  and for different values of the
coupling FORMULA . Here, the solid (dashed,
small dashed) line-curve represents the BR for and
FORMULA  without -with the
lepton KK modes. These figures show that the BR(FORMULA ) is at the order of the magnitude of FORMULA  for FORMULA 
without the internal lepton KK mode contributions. With the
inclusion of the internal lepton KK modes, there occurs a
considerable enhancement, FORMULA  three order to almost FORMULA 
(more than four orders to FORMULA ) in the range of FORMULA , FORMULA  for set II (III). Even for the large curvature, the
enhancement of the BR due to the extra dimension contributions,
here, the internal lepton KK modes, is large and this is a worthy
observation for checking the existence and, also, the nature of
the extra dimensions.
Finally, in Figs. REF -REF , we
present the parameter FORMULA  dependence of the BR of the LFV
FORMULA  decay for lepton location set II-III,
for FORMULA  and for different values of
the coupling FORMULA . Here, the solid
(dashed, small dashed) line-curve represents the BR for and
FORMULA  without -with the
lepton KK modes. It is observed that the BR (FORMULA ) is at the order of the magnitude of FORMULA  for FORMULA 
without the internal lepton KK mode contributions. Similar to
previous decays, the inclusion of the internal lepton KK modes
bring a considerable enhancement to the BR, FORMULA  three orders
to almost FORMULA  (nearly more than four orders to more than
FORMULA ) in the range of FORMULA , FORMULA  for set II (III).
The current numerical result BRFORMULA  at FORMULA 
CL by {{cite:ecde35ee-1677-4ee4-8c4c-5fb483a81000}} ({{cite:3082fecc-c3c9-44bb-8c5e-2b0f1984994d}}) can be reached even for weak
Yukawa interactions and for intermediate values of the curvature
parameter FORMULA , with the inclusion of lepton KK modes, especially
for the location set III.
For completeness, we present the results of the same processes for
various scenarios in the case of flat extra dimensions. For the
flat one universal extra dimension, the enhancements of the BRs of
the LFV decays (especially the BR of the FORMULA 
decay), due to the lepton KK modes and the new neutral Higgs KK
modes are tiny for the compactification radius FORMULA , FORMULA . However, since the contribution of the universal extra
dimension to any process exists at least in the loop
levelThe processes with incoming and outgoing zero mode
particles can get contributions from the universal extra dimension
at least in the loop level since the KK number should be conserved
at the vertices and the tree level contribution with a single KK
mode does not appear., the LFV decays, which can exist also in
the loop level and which are clean in the sense that are free from
the strong interactions, are among the most informative processes
in order to search this type of extra dimension. If one considers
the flat non-universal extra dimensions where the new Higgs bosons
are accessible to the extra dimension but leptons live on the 4D
braneThe electric dipole moments of the charged leptons
are among the clean physical quantities and they are worthwhile to
study in order to search the extra dimensions., there exist
considerable enhancements in the BRs of the LFV decays, in the
case of two spatial extra dimensions and the discrepancy between
the experimental and the theoretical values of the BRs can be
overcome {{cite:b483a8a1-b681-4143-9abc-266a0a004eb8}}, {{cite:705e0a57-73bd-493a-b9f3-1a1c7e4cf92a}}. In the the split
fermion scenario where the fermions are localized with Gaussian
profiles at different points in the extra dimension, the
enhancements in the BRs of LFV decays are tiny for a single extra
dimension and the sensitivities of the BRs increase for two extra
dimensions {{cite:a383827a-80ff-440f-87d4-cc20bf557d31}}. For both cases, the enhancements
in the BRs are due to the abundance of new neutral Higgs KK modes.
If the new Higgs doublet is restricted to the 4D brane (thin
bulk), we observe that the BRs are sensitive to the location of
the 4D brane in the extra dimension (the width of the thin bulk),
especially for the FORMULA  decay
{{cite:93c85ace-5577-4d39-9ca9-da1872481930}}. Notice that in the case of non-universal
extra dimensions, there is no need for the KK number to conserve
at the vertices and the processes with a single internal KK mode
can exist. Therefore, the non-universal extra dimension(s) results
in non zero contribution also in the tree level and the physical
quantities related to such processes are not suppressed. Even if
the BRs of the LFV interactions are sensitive to the effects of
the non-universal extra dimensions, the processes existing in the
tree level with internal KK modes are more informative to search
the extra dimensions.
Now we would like to present our results briefly.

The idea that the hierarchy of new Yukawa couplings is
described by the location of leptons in the bulk of RS1 background
is worthwhile to study. However, with a unique set of Yukawa
couplings, the coupling FORMULA  and the others created from
FORMULA , we observe that it is not possible to get theoretical
values of the BRs coinciding with the current experimental results
of the LFV decays under consideration. Furthermore, we see that
the BRs are not sensitive to the curvature parameter FORMULA  and the
internal lepton KK mode contributions. Notice that, in this case,
we choose the left handed and right handed charged lepton
positions as the same in the extra dimension. The future more
accurate experimental measurements, especially for the
FORMULA  decay, would make it possible to test
the physics behind the hierarchy of new Yukawa couplings and the
effect of extra dimensions on this hierarchy.

In the case that the left handed and right handed charged
lepton positions are different in the extra dimension, the
addition of lepton KK modes result in considerable enhancement in
the BRs, especially for the small values of the parameter FORMULA .
Furthermore, this enhancement increases and the sensitivity of BR
to the curvature parameter FORMULA  becomes strong by taking the
location points of left handed charged leptons near to the visible
brane. This is due to the fact that the left handed KK mode
couplings to the new Higgs scalars, living on the visible brane,
become stronger. Therefore, it would be possible to enhance the
BRs by localizing the lepton fields at appropriate points in the
extra dimension, and, even with the small values of Yukawa
couplings and even in single extra dimension, the experimental
values of the BR of the LFV decay under consideration can be
reached. This is interesting and the forthcoming measurements of
the BRs of the LFV decays, especially the FORMULA  decay, would give considerable information about the
existence and, also, the nature of the warped extra dimensions. .
