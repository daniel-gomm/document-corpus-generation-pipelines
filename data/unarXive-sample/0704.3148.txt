Abstract.
The new formulation of the causal completion of spacetimes
suggested in {{cite:fe643458-a465-49bc-84f6-5b5288174e3d}}, and modified later in {{cite:cbab7c27-cf84-4947-ab34-c38380362dfd}}, is tested by
computing the causal boundary for product spacetimes of a Lorentz
interval and a Riemannian manifold. This is particularized for two
important families of spacetimes, conformal to the previous ones:
(standard) static spacetimes and Generalized Robertson-Walker
spacetimes. As consequence, it is shown that this new approach
essentially reproduces the structure of the conformal boundary for
multiple classical spacetimes: Reissner-Nordstrom (including
Schwarzschild), Anti-de Sitter, Taub and standard cosmological
models as de Sitter and Einstein Universe.
Keywords: boundary on spacetime, causal boundary, Busemann function, (standard) static spacetimes, Generalized Robertson-Walker spacetimes.

Introduction
In the last decades, relativists have shown great interest in
certain remarkable properties related to the asymptotic behavior of
spacetimes, as singularities. In order to get a better understanding
of these phenomenons, sometimes it is very useful to attach a sort
of ideal boundary to the spacetime. However, the construction of the
`optimal' boundary has shown to be a very elusive problem up to
date.
A well-known boundary in Relativity is the conformal boundary
{{cite:48576be8-a1f3-48c9-b7da-dd235f2604da}}, which consists of conformally embedding the original
spacetime into a larger one, and then, taking the boundary of the
image. However, this method is neither systematic nor intrinsic, and
sometimes it results very restrictive. In order to overcome these
handicaps, Geroch, Kronheimer and Penrose introduced a new
construction called causal boundary {{cite:8fda79ac-ad4b-4e84-8d4b-dc23997f649e}}. In this new
approach they attach a future (past) ideal point for every
inextensible, physically admissible future (past) trajectory, in
such a way that the ideal point only depends on the past (future) of
the trajectory. In fact, this method is systematic, intrinsic and
very general. However, it suffers from an important technical
difficulty: in general, some future and past ideal points must be
identified in order to avoid pathologies derived from having `too
big' boundaries.
Many authors have tried different methods to establish these
identifications {{cite:8fda79ac-ad4b-4e84-8d4b-dc23997f649e}}, {{cite:92e6df1f-4d66-4b96-a145-6eac0e36e21b}}, {{cite:9e372a84-399c-4ea6-9054-eb86bc713ca0}}, {{cite:884fb11d-ad6b-4e60-842b-1e83eef8fbc1}}; indeed, this question is related
to the introduction of a satisfactory topology for the completion.
However, they have not obtained totally satisfactory results up to
date (see {{cite:48f25c2d-64c1-42cf-b821-6e4efebcb386}}, {{cite:5bc6775f-2597-4d5e-aa29-4f75bc56bacc}}, {{cite:0b7fb6a5-781a-415c-b527-56fa2b7f841c}}, {{cite:fe643458-a465-49bc-84f6-5b5288174e3d}}). See also {{cite:cad3ad61-2440-4e0a-8fd2-b8f1c1f3868e}}, {{cite:6e676f19-8492-4b68-af4e-6f15e784308c}} for
interesting reviews on the subject.
Based on a new formulation by Marolf and Ross {{cite:fe643458-a465-49bc-84f6-5b5288174e3d}}, which
replace the identifications by pairs representing the ideal points,
recently the second author has developed a new approach to the
causal boundary with promising results {{cite:cbab7c27-cf84-4947-ab34-c38380362dfd}}. This approach lies
on a `minimality principle' which allows to establish the desired
pairs, in addition to a reasonable topology for the completion. As
consequence, it is obtained a construction with many satisfactory
mathematical properties. However, this construction has not been
checked in many spacetimes of physical interest.
In this paper we are going to test this new formulation by computing
the causal boundary for some physically relevant spacetimes. After a
preliminary section devoted to recall some basic notions on causal
structure and causal completions, in Section  we construct
the causal boundary for product spacetimes of a Lorentz interval and
a Riemannian manifold. In Section  we use the conformal
invariance of the causal boundary to directly deduce the boundary
for two important families in the conformal class: (standard) static
spacetimes and Generalized Robertson-Walker spacetimes. As
consequence, we describe the boundary for multiple classical
spacetimes in these families: Reissner-Nordstrom (including
Schwarzschild), Anti-de Sitter, Taub and standard cosmological
models as de Sitter and Einstein Universe. Finally, in Section
 we summarize the main conclusions, putting special emphasis
in the fact that this approach essentially reproduces the structure
of the conformal boundary for these examples.

Preliminaries
Let FORMULA  be a spacetime, i.e. a connected smooth manifold FORMULA 
endowed with metric tensor FORMULA  of index 1. A tangent vector FORMULA , FORMULA  is named timelike (resp. lightlike;
spacelike; causal) if FORMULA  (resp. FORMULA  and
FORMULA ; FORMULA  or FORMULA ; FORMULA  is either timelike or
lightlike). Accordingly, a smooth curve FORMULA  (FORMULA 
real interval) is called timelike (resp. lightlike; spacelike; causal) if FORMULA  is timelike (resp.
lightlike; spacelike; causal) for all FORMULA . Spacetimes are assumed to
be time-orientable, i.e. they must admit a time-orientation, which is a continuous, globally defined, timelike
vector field FORMULA . Fixed a time-orientation FORMULA , a causal curve
FORMULA  is said future-directed (resp. past-directed) if FORMULA  (resp.
FORMULA ) for all FORMULA . Future-directed causal
curves represent all the physically admissible trajectories for
material particles and light rays in the universe.
Two events FORMULA  are chronologically related FORMULA 
(resp. causally related FORMULA ) if there exists some
future-directed timelike (resp. causal) curve from FORMULA  to FORMULA . If
FORMULA  but FORMULA , they are said horismotically
related FORMULA . The chronological past of FORMULA ,
FORMULA , (resp. causal past of FORMULA , FORMULA ) is defined
as:
FORMULA 
Of course, the chronological future of FORMULA , FORMULA  (resp.
causal future of FORMULA , FORMULA ) is defined by replacing
FORMULA  (resp. FORMULA ) by FORMULA  (resp. FORMULA ) in
previous definition.
The main purpose of the causal completion of spacetimes is to avoid
the existence of inextensible timelike curves. This is overcome by
adding ideal points to the spacetime in such a way that any
timelike curve presents some endpoint in the new space. In order to
rigorously describe this completion, applicable to strongly
causal spacetimes (i.e. spacetimes without closed or `nearly
closed' timelike curves), previously we need to introduce some
terminology:
A subset FORMULA  is called past set if it
coincides with its past, which is always open; i.e.
FORMULA . Given a
subset FORMULA , the common past of FORMULA  is defined by
FORMULA . A
past set that cannot be written as the union of two proper subsets,
both of which are also past sets, is called indecomposable
past set, IP. An IP which does not coincide with the past of any
point in FORMULA  is called terminal indecomposable past set, TIP.
Otherwise, it is called proper indecomposable past set, PIP.
By interchanging the roles of past and future, we obtain the
corresponding notions for future set, common future, IF,
TIF and PIF.
In order to construct the future causal completion, first identify
every event FORMULA  with its PIP, FORMULA . Then, the future causal boundary FORMULA  of FORMULA  is defined as
the set of all TIPs in FORMULA . Therefore, the future causal
completion FORMULA  becomes the set of all IPs:
FORMULA 
Analogously, every event FORMULA  can be identified with its PIF,
FORMULA . Then, the past causal boundary
FORMULA  of FORMULA  is defined as the set of all TIFs in
FORMULA , and thus, the past causal completion FORMULA  is the
set of all IFs:
FORMULA 
For the (total) causal completion, one immediately thinks of the
space FORMULA . However, it becomes evident that by
only imposing the obvious identifications FORMULA  on
FORMULA  for all FORMULA , the resulting space
FORMULA  does not provide a satisfactory description for the
boundary of FORMULA : in fact, this procedure often attaches two ideal
points where we would expect only one.
The first attempt to establish identifications in
FORMULA  was proposed in
{{cite:8fda79ac-ad4b-4e84-8d4b-dc23997f649e}}. The authors introduced a generalized Alexandrov topology
on FORMULA : the topology generated by the sub-basis
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
Then, they suggested the minimum set of identifications necessary to
obtain a Hausdorff space. However, this method fails to produce the
`expected' structure and topology for the completion in some
examples {{cite:48f25c2d-64c1-42cf-b821-6e4efebcb386}}, {{cite:5bc6775f-2597-4d5e-aa29-4f75bc56bacc}}, {{cite:62270553-73b8-4e35-a696-57cba6482f0c}}, {{cite:fe643458-a465-49bc-84f6-5b5288174e3d}}. As
commented before, other more accurate attempts have been suggested
since then, but without totally satisfactory results.
An alternative procedure to making identifications consists of
forming pairs composed by past and future indecomposable sets of
FORMULA . This approach, firstly introduced in {{cite:fe643458-a465-49bc-84f6-5b5288174e3d}} and developed
later in {{cite:cbab7c27-cf84-4947-ab34-c38380362dfd}}, has exhibited satisfactory results for those
spacetimes analyzed up to date (see {{cite:fe643458-a465-49bc-84f6-5b5288174e3d}}, {{cite:cbab7c27-cf84-4947-ab34-c38380362dfd}}, {{cite:4867dc69-22c1-4d7f-a510-9c80cc677085}}). In this paper
we are going to test this approach for product spacetimes.
Even if the criteria proposed in {{cite:fe643458-a465-49bc-84f6-5b5288174e3d}} and {{cite:cbab7c27-cf84-4947-ab34-c38380362dfd}} for pairing
terminal sets are different in general, they coincide in many cases.
In particular, they coincide for those spacetimes such that every
terminal set is not S-related (Szabados related) with more than one
terminal set: we say that FORMULA  are S-related, FORMULA ,
if FORMULA  is maximal IP into FORMULA  and FORMULA  is maximal IF into
FORMULA . For these spacetimes, the construction in {{cite:cbab7c27-cf84-4947-ab34-c38380362dfd}} reduces to the following definition coming from {{cite:fe643458-a465-49bc-84f6-5b5288174e3d}}:
Definition 2.1  The (total) causal boundary FORMULA  is formed by all
the pairs FORMULA  formed by a TIP FORMULA  and a TIF FORMULA  such that:
either FORMULA ; or FORMULA  and there is no FORMULA  such that FORMULA ; or FORMULA  and there is no
FORMULA  such that FORMULA .

This will be the definition adopted in this paper, since product
spacetimes always satisfy the property above (Remark REF ).
With this definition, the causal structure of the spacetime can be
easily extended to the completion. Concretely, we say that FORMULA  are chronologically related,
FORMULA , if FORMULA . Here, FORMULA ,
FORMULA  will be said causally related, FORMULA ,
if FORMULA  and FORMULA . Finally, FORMULA , FORMULA  are
horismotically related, FORMULA , if they
are causally, but not chronologically, related.
The topology of the spacetime can be also extended to the
completion. Here we adopt the so called chronological
topology, firstly introduced in {{cite:cbab7c27-cf84-4947-ab34-c38380362dfd}}. This topology is defined
in terms of the following limit operator FORMULA : given a sequence
FORMULA , we say that FORMULA  ifBy LI and LS we must understand the usual
inferior and superior limits of sets: i.e. LIFORMULA  and
LSFORMULA .
FORMULA 
Then, the closed sets for the chronological topology are those
subsets FORMULA  such that FORMULA  for
any sequence FORMULA .
Finally, we remark that the causal boundary is conformally
invariant, i.e. it remains unaltered under conformal transformations
of the spacetime.

Causal boundary for product spacetimes
We consider product spacetimes FORMULA  of a Lorentz interval
FORMULA , FORMULA  and a Riemannian manifold
FORMULA :
FORMULA 
Here, the time orientation is determined by FORMULA . Of
course, these spacetimes are always strongly causal, and thus, the
causal completion applies. In order to construct the causal boundary
of these spacetimes, we have followed several steps. By
completeness, we have included here some arguments and results
coming from {{cite:93dfacaf-d867-4095-b2bb-3d5a9b83f245}}.

FORMULA 1. Computation of PIPs and PIFs:

We begin by computing the PIPs and PIFs. If FORMULA  then there exists a timelike curve
FORMULA  such that FORMULA ,
FORMULA . Since FORMULA  is timelike, necessarily
FORMULA  for all FORMULA . In
particular,
FORMULA 
being FORMULA  the distance in FORMULA  associated to FORMULA . Reciprocally, if
FORMULA  then there exists a curve FORMULA  in FORMULA 
with FORMULA , FORMULA  such that FORMULA 
for all FORMULA . Therefore, the curve FORMULA , with
FORMULA , is timelike and satisfies
FORMULA , FORMULA , proving that
FORMULA . Summarizing:
FORMULA 
This property directly provides the following result:
Proposition 3.1 The PIPs and PIFs of product spacetime (REF ) are:
FORMULA 
being FORMULA .


FORMULA 2. Computation of TIPs and TIFs:

To this aim, we only need to compute the past and future of
inextensible timelike curves (see, for example, {{cite:7c1cc3a7-94db-43ec-8193-36c87b27a871}}). So, let FORMULA  be an inextensible
future-directed timelike curve. In particular, FORMULA  for
all FORMULA , and thus, we can reparametrize FORMULA  by FORMULA  in order to
obtain FORMULA , where now the spatial projection FORMULA  is
a curve with domain some interval FORMULA , FORMULA  and
velocity FORMULA . The following definition will be useful:
Definition 3.2 We define the Busemann function of such a curve FORMULA  as the function:
FORMULA 

Recall that the past of FORMULA  coincides with the union of the
pasts FORMULA  FORMULA . Therefore,
FORMULA  if and only if FORMULA  for some FORMULA  close enough to FORMULA  (observe
that FORMULA  if
FORMULA ). Taking into account (REF ), this condition
translates into the following inequality:
FORMULA 
If FORMULA  is an inextensible past-directed timelike
curve, analogous arguments can be applied (just interchange the
roles of future and past) in order to obtain: FORMULA  if and only if
FORMULA 
Summarizing, we can establish the following result:
Proposition 3.3  The TIPs (TIFs) of product
spacetime (REF ) are:
FORMULA 
for any inextensible future (past) timelike curve FORMULA .


FORMULA 3. Partial boundaries:

The structure of the partial boundaries can be analyzed in terms of
the extremes of the interval:

Case FORMULA . Any inextensible curve FORMULA  with
component FORMULA  approaching to some FORMULA  satisfy
FORMULA . Moreover, in this case FORMULA .
Therefore, from Proposition REF  these curves satisfy
FORMULA 
This TIP corresponds to the future timelike infinity, and is
labeled by FORMULA . The rest of TIPs are univocally determined by
all the finite Busemann functions FORMULA  in FORMULA 
associated to inextensible components FORMULA  of curves FORMULA .
Therefore, if FORMULA  denotes the set of all these finite
Busemann functions, then we have:
FORMULA 
The set FORMULA  is invariant under the additive action: if
FORMULA  then FORMULA  for all FORMULA  (in fact, FORMULA  if FORMULA ).
Therefore, if we define the Busemann boundary as the quotient
FORMULA 
then it is
FORMULA 
It should be remarked that FORMULA  includes two types of
elements. Those points associated to inextensible curves FORMULA  with
FORMULA , which can be interpreted as `infinity directions'
of the manifold FORMULA ; and those points associated to inextensible
curves FORMULA  with FORMULA , which define points of the Cauchy boundary FORMULA  of the manifold. In this last
case we have FORMULA , FORMULA .

Case FORMULA . Now FORMULA , and thus, FORMULA 
for any FORMULA . In particular, FORMULA  does not belong to the future
boundary of the spacetime. Indeed, every inextensible curve FORMULA 
with FORMULA  approaching to some FORMULA , and thus, FORMULA , has
Busemann function FORMULA . As consequence, the
future boundary contains a copy of FORMULA . The rest of TIPs are
univocally determined by all the finite Busemann functions
FORMULA  associated to inextensible components FORMULA  of curves
FORMULA . We denoted this set by FORMULA . Arguing as before,
FORMULA  is invariant by the additive action: if FORMULA  then FORMULA  for all FORMULA . Therefore:
FORMULA 

If we repeat the arguments above, but now interchanging the roles
of future and past, we obtain the corresponding results for the
past boundaries in terms of the extreme FORMULA . That is:

Case FORMULA . Now FORMULA , where FORMULA  labels the TIF FORMULA  corresponding to the
past timelike infinity.
 Case FORMULA . Now FORMULA .

FORMULA 4. The (total) causal boundary:

In order to construct the (total) causal boundary from the partial
boundaries, we need to know which TIPs FORMULA  and TIFs FORMULA  are
S-related. The following lemma solves this question:
Lemma 3.4  Two terminal sets
FORMULA  of FORMULA  satisfy FORMULA  iff for some
 FORMULA
FORMULA 

Proof. Suppose that FORMULA , with FORMULA .
Let FORMULA ,
FORMULA  be an inextensible future-directed
timelike curve such that FORMULA . Since FORMULA  and coordinate FORMULA  strictly increases
along future-directed timelike curves, necessarily FORMULA .
Moreover, since FORMULA  is inextensible, necessarily
FORMULA . Analogously,
FORMULA , where FORMULA , FORMULA , is an inextensible
past-directed timelike curve such that FORMULA  and FORMULA . Summarizing:
FORMULA 
being FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Moreover, it is FORMULA , since,
otherwise, we can take FORMULA  and
FORMULA  such that
FORMULA , which
implies FORMULA ,
FORMULA  but
FORMULA , in
contradiction with FORMULA . Finally, notice also that
FORMULA , and thus, FORMULA . In fact, take any
FORMULA  and FORMULA 
such that FORMULA  and
FORMULA . Then,
FORMULA  satisfies
FORMULA , which contradicts
the maximality of FORMULA  into FORMULA .
Assume now that (REF ) holds for some FORMULA .
If FORMULA  then FORMULA , which implies FORMULA . Therefore, FORMULA . Moreover, FORMULA  is
maximal into FORMULA , since, otherwise, there would exist
FORMULA  satisfying FORMULA  and
FORMULA , a contradiction. Analogously, we can
prove that FORMULA  is maximal into FORMULA . Whence, FORMULA .
 FORMULA
Remark 3.5  In particular, this shows that every terminal set is not S-related with more
than one terminal set.


From Definition REF , Lemma REF  and Remark
REF , we deduce the following result:
Proposition 3.6 The causal boundary FORMULA  of
FORMULA  can be written as the union of the corresponding partial
boundaries FORMULA , FORMULA , with each
pair of lines in FORMULA , FORMULA  based on
the same point of FORMULA  identified.


FORMULA 5. Causal structure and topology for the
boundary:

The causal relations between ideal points are given by this
proposition:
Proposition 3.7  Let FORMULA ,
FORMULA  be a product spacetime. Then:
(i)
The lines of the boundary based on points in
FORMULA  are null (i.e. any two
points on the line are horismotically related).
(ii)
The lines of the boundary based on points in
FORMULA  are timelike (i.e. any two points on the line are
chronologically related).
(iii)
The copies of FORMULA  in the boundary are spacelike (i.e. any two points on the copy are not causally related).


Proof. (i) Let FORMULA , FORMULA  be two
elements of the boundary lying on some line based on some point in
FORMULA . Then, it is not a
restriction to assume
FORMULA 
Therefore, FORMULA ,
which proves that FORMULA  and FORMULA  are causally
related. On the other hand, the equality FORMULA  implies that they are not chronologically related.
Whence FORMULA  and FORMULA  are horismotically
related.
(ii) Let FORMULA , FORMULA  be two elements of the boundary
lying on some line based on some point FORMULA . We
can assume that
FORMULA 
As consequence, if FORMULA  and
FORMULA  is such that FORMULA , then
FORMULA ,
FORMULA , and thus,
FORMULA . Whence, FORMULA 
and FORMULA  are chronologically related.
(iii) For example, let FORMULA  be
two elements of some copy of FORMULA  in the boundary. Then
FORMULA  for some inextensible timelike curve
FORMULA , FORMULA ,
FORMULA , and FORMULA  for
some inextensible timelike curve FORMULA ,
FORMULA , FORMULA ,
FORMULA . In particular, FORMULA ,
FORMULA  for all FORMULA  close enough to FORMULA .
Whence, FORMULA , FORMULA , which implies that
FORMULA , FORMULA  are not causally related.  FORMULA

Finally, the topology for the causal completion is directly deduced
from the definition of limit operator FORMULA  in terms of FORMULA  and
FORMULA  (formulae (REF )):
Proposition 3.8 The chronological topology on FORMULA  coincides with the quotient topology under FORMULA  of the topology generated
by the limit operators FORMULA  and FORMULA  on FORMULA .


FORMULA 6. Main result:

All these propositions, joined to the following result from
{{cite:35ae9248-caec-4081-9034-bf9e34f7c2d4}}, yield our main statement, Theorem
REF .
Proposition 3.9  Let FORMULA  be a Riemannian manifold with FORMULA , FORMULA 
a positive function, FORMULA  a compact manifold, and metric given by
FORMULA  (being FORMULA  the metric on FORMULA ).
For some FORMULA  in FORMULA , assume that
FORMULA  is decreasing in FORMULA  and
increasing in FORMULA , or increasing in the
whole FORMULA  with FORMULA , FORMULA . Then
FORMULA  is formed by two spaces FORMULA  and
FORMULA , attached at FORMULA  and
FORMULA , resp., with each FORMULA 
(FORMULA ) being FORMULA  or an unique point FORMULA :
concretely, FORMULA  if
FORMULA , and
FORMULA  if
FORMULA . Moreover,
FORMULA  belongs to FORMULA  if and only if the
extreme FORMULA  is finite.


Theorem 3.10  Let FORMULA , FORMULA  be
a product spacetime whose spatial part FORMULA  falls under the
hypotheses of Proposition REF . Then, the causal boundary of
FORMULA  admits the following structure (with the chronological
topology):
(i)
If FORMULA  then it is formed by two
infinity null cones, one for the future and another for the past,
with base FORMULA  and apexes
FORMULA  and FORMULA , resp., and timelike lines of future and past
extremes FORMULA  and FORMULA , resp., on each point of
FORMULA  (Figure 1).
(ii)
If FORMULA 
then it is formed by two copies, one for the future and another for
the past, of the Cauchy completion FORMULA  of FORMULA ,
and timelike lines based on each point of FORMULA  which
connect both copies (Figure 2).
(iii)
If FORMULA  then it is formed by an
infinity null cone for the future with base
FORMULA  and apex FORMULA , a copy
of FORMULA  for the past, and timelike lines based on each
point of FORMULA  which connect FORMULA  with
FORMULA  (Figure 3).
(iv)
If FORMULA  then it is
formed by an infinity null cone for the past with base
FORMULA  and apex FORMULA , a copy
of FORMULA  for the future, and timelike lines based on
each point of FORMULA  which connect FORMULA  with
FORMULA  (Figure 4).

Moreover, FORMULA  is formed by two spaces FORMULA 
and FORMULA , attached at FORMULA  and
FORMULA , resp., with each FORMULA 
(FORMULA ) being FORMULA  or an unique point FORMULA :
concretely, FORMULA  if
FORMULA , and
FORMULA  if
FORMULA . Finally,
FORMULA  belongs to the Cauchy boundary FORMULA  if
and only if the extreme FORMULA  is finite.

In particular, Theorem REF  shows that the causal boundary
of a product spacetime is exclusively determined by the Busemann
boundary FORMULA  (and the Cauchy boundary
FORMULA ) of the spatial part FORMULA  and the extremes of
the temporal interval FORMULA .
Remark 3.11  If the spatial part FORMULA  does not fall under the hypotheses of Proposition REF , the structure statements of the first part of Theorem REF  are still true.

Applications
Even though product spacetimes present a relatively simple
structure, the conformal class is very general, including families
of spacetimes of great interest in Relativity. Concretely, we have
(standard) static spacetimes and Generalized
Robertson-Walker spacetimes.
Static spacetimes
(Standard) static spacetimes can be written as
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is a Riemannian manifold and FORMULA  a positive
function defined on FORMULA . A systematic study of the partial
boundaries for these spacetimes was initiated by Harris in
{{cite:93dfacaf-d867-4095-b2bb-3d5a9b83f245}}, and then continued in collaboration with the second
author in {{cite:35ae9248-caec-4081-9034-bf9e34f7c2d4}}. However, these papers do not deal with the
question of how to attach the partial boundaries together in order
to form the (total) causal boundary. In this section we are going to
apply Theorem REF  to cover this deficiency.
First, apply a conformal transformation to (REF ), with
conformal factor FORMULA . We obtain the new metric
FORMULA 
So, the conformal invariance of the causal boundary reduces the
problem to study the product spacetime:
FORMULA 
where we have renamed FORMULA  by FORMULA . This spacetime falls
under the hypothesis (i) of Theorem REF . Therefore:
Theorem 4.1  Let FORMULA  be a static spacetime as in (REF ). Assume that the spatial part
FORMULA  endowed with metric FORMULA  falls under the hypotheses
of Proposition REF . Then, the causal boundary (with the
chronological topology) is formed by two null cones, one for the
future and another for the past, with base
FORMULA  and apexes FORMULA  and
FORMULA , resp., and timelike lines on each element of
FORMULA , with future and past extremes FORMULA  and
FORMULA , resp. (Figure 1). Moreover, FORMULA  is formed by
two spaces FORMULA  and FORMULA , attached at
FORMULA  and FORMULA , resp., with each
FORMULA  (FORMULA ) being FORMULA  or an unique point
FORMULA : FORMULA  if
FORMULA , and
FORMULA  if
FORMULA . Finally,
FORMULA  belongs to the Cauchy boundary FORMULA  if and
only if the extreme FORMULA  is finite.


Next, we are going to apply this result to some
classical static spacetimes:

FORMULA  Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime:

In local coordinates, this spacetime can be written as:
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
It models the gravitational field outside an electrically charged
massive object which is spherically symmetric. The constants FORMULA 
and FORMULA  can be identified with the gravitational mass and the
electric charge of the object. The static regions of this spacetime
are determined by condition FORMULA . So, we distinguish two cases:

-Case weakly or critically charged, FORMULA : Here, FORMULA 
is positive for FORMULA , where
FORMULA . First, consider the exterior
region FORMULA . We have
FORMULA 
Observe that FORMULA  endowed with metric FORMULA  falls under
the hypotheses of Proposition REF , being
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
Moreover,
FORMULA 
Therefore: the causal boundary of the exterior region of weakly
or critically charged Reissner-Nordstrom (with the chronological
topology) is formed by two null cones at FORMULA  with base
FORMULA  and apexes FORMULA , FORMULA , and two null cones at infinity
with base FORMULA  and the same apexes FORMULA , FORMULA  (Figure 5).
In particular, this is also the causal boundary for the exterior
region of Schwarzschild spacetime (FORMULA ).
This is in agreement with the conformal approach. The double cone at
FORMULA  is due to the fact that only the region FORMULA  is
considered. On the other hand, the double cone at infinity is due to
the similarity between Reissner-Nordstrom and Minkowski far away
from the source.

Consider now the interior region FORMULA . We have
FORMULA 
The spatial part FORMULA  endowed with metric FORMULA  falls
again under the hypotheses of Proposition REF , with
FORMULA  and FORMULA  as before, but now
FORMULA 
Moreover,
FORMULA 
Therefore: the causal boundary of the interior region of weakly
or critically charged Reissner-Nordstrom (with the chronological
topology) is formed by two null cones at FORMULA , with base
FORMULA  and apexes FORMULA  and FORMULA , joined by both extremes to
an unique timelike line at FORMULA , the central singularity (Figure
5).
This result justifies rigourously the identifications between the
future and past timelike lines at FORMULA  suggested in {{cite:35ae9248-caec-4081-9034-bf9e34f7c2d4}} `without proof'. Notice also that the Reissner-Nordstrom
singularity becomes 1-dimensional, in contraposition to the
well-known FORMULA  structure of the Schwarzschild
singularity.
FIGURE 

-Case strongly charged, FORMULA : Now, FORMULA  for all FORMULA ,
and so, the static region coincides with the whole spacetime
FORMULA . Therefore, FORMULA , and FORMULA , FORMULA  maintain the same expression as
before. The spatial part FORMULA  endowed with metric FORMULA 
falls under the hypotheses of Proposition REF , being
FORMULA  and FORMULA  as in previous cases, and
FORMULA 
Moreover,
FORMULA 
Therefore: the causal boundary of strongly charged
Reissner-Nordstrom (with the chronological topology) is formed by
two null cones at FORMULA  with base FORMULA  and apexes FORMULA ,
FORMULA , and a timelike line at FORMULA  with the same extremes
FORMULA , FORMULA . (In this case, the diagram corresponds to the
right picture in Figure 5 with FORMULA  and FORMULA 
replaced by FORMULA .)

FORMULA  Anti-de Sitter spacetime:

This spacetime of constant sectional curvature FORMULA  and topology
FORMULA  does contain closed timelike curves. In
particular, it is not strongly causal, and thus, the causal boundary
approach cannot apply. However, this spacetime is not 1-connected,
being its universal cover strongly causal and static. Consequently,
in this section by Anti-de Sitter spacetime we will understand
its universal cover.
In local coordinates, Anti-de Sitter spacetime can be written as
FORMULA 
According to the notation previously introduced, we have
FORMULA 
The spatial part FORMULA  endowed with metric FORMULA  falls
under the hypotheses of Proposition REF , being
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
Moreover,
FORMULA 
Therefore, if we ignore the boundary region associated to FORMULA ,
which is not representative because it corresponds to a coordinate
singularity, we obtain the following structure: the causal
boundary of Anti-de Sitter spacetime (with the chronological
topology) is formed just by a timelike surface at FORMULA  of
section FORMULA , which connects the points FORMULA  and FORMULA 
(Figure 6).

In particular, this structure coincides with the conformal boundary.
Notice however that points FORMULA , FORMULA  are isolated in the
conformal approach {{cite:d4042383-d9ab-41dd-9d5a-77b7f0bbc11d}}.

FORMULA  Taub spacetime:

This spacetime, firstly introduced by A. H. Taub in {{cite:ec6f4083-1558-4ef9-8077-0a97de697b84}}, can
be written as:
FORMULA 
It is the unique solution of empty Einstein equations without
cosmological term, which is plane symmetric and static. The causal
boundary of Taub spacetime was studied by Kuang, Li and Liang in
{{cite:48f25c2d-64c1-42cf-b821-6e4efebcb386}}. Surprisingly, they found that the singular region of the
boundary reduces to one point when the GKP construction is applied,
in contraposition to the 1-dimensional structure physically
expected. Since then, this result has been claimed as an important
evidence that GKP approach is not totally satisfactory. Next, we are
going to apply Theorem REF  in order to show that this defect
is not present in the approach followed in this paper.
According to the notation previously introduced, now we have:
FORMULA 
Therefore,
FORMULA 
In this case, the spatial part FORMULA  endowed with metric
FORMULA  does not fall under the hypotheses of Proposition
REF , since FORMULA  is not compact. However, from the
analysis and classification of the pasts and futures of inextensible
causal curves developed in {{cite:48f25c2d-64c1-42cf-b821-6e4efebcb386}}, it implicitly
follows
FORMULA 
Therefore, from the first part of Theorem REF  (recall Remark
REF ), we obtain: the causal boundary of Taub spacetime is
formed by a timelike line at FORMULA  of future and past extremes
FORMULA , FORMULA , resp., and two null cones at FORMULA , one
for the future and another for the past, with base FORMULA  and
apexes FORMULA , FORMULA , resp. (Figure 7).

In conclusion, this result does reproduce the 1-dimensional
character of the Taub singularity, represented by the region of the
boundary at FORMULA .

Generalized Robertson-Walker spacetimes
By Generalized Robertson-Walker (GRW) spacetimes we understand the
family of spacetimes given by:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is an open interval of FORMULA  called base, FORMULA  is an arbitrary Riemannian manifold called fiber and FORMULA  is a positive function defined on FORMULA 
called warping function or scale factor. This family is
quite important in Relativity, since it provides a first approach to
the global structure of the universe: not for nothing it arises as a
natural generalization of the standard cosmological models (studied
in a moment). See {{cite:b3ff6693-1cc0-432f-9590-eaddd59b2d5d}}, {{cite:d6a04281-a16f-4132-a3ce-45fe793c0b53}} for local and global geometrical
characterizations of GRW spacetimes.
The causal boundary of these spacetimes can be obtained by applying
the result {{cite:62270553-73b8-4e35-a696-57cba6482f0c}}, which describes the partial
boundaries for the more general family of multiwarped
spacetimes (i.e., multiple fibers and multiple warping functions
considered). However, this result does not work when the resulting
boundary has non-spacelike regions. In this section we are going to
use Theorem REF  to extend this result to cover any causal
character for the boundary, at least in the smaller class of GRW
spacetimes.
To this aim, first apply a conformal transformation to
(REF ), with conformal factor FORMULA . We
obtain the new metric
FORMULA 
where the variable FORMULA  is defined by the relation
FORMULA . Taking into account the conformal
invariance of the causal boundary, we only need to study the product
spacetime
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the domain for the new variable FORMULA , and thus, it
may be different from the initial interval FORMULA . From the
relation between FORMULA  and FORMULA  it directly follows:
FORMULA 
Therefore, we conclude that the causal boundary of GRW spacetime
(REF ) coincides with that of the spacetime
FORMULA 
where we have renamed FORMULA  and FORMULA  by FORMULA  and FORMULA , resp.
Theorem REF  applied to (REF ) then provides the
following result:
Theorem 4.2  Let FORMULA , FORMULA  be a GRW spacetime with spatial part
FORMULA  under the hypotheses of Proposition REF . Then, the
causal boundary (with the chronological topology) has the following
structure:
(i)
If
FORMULA 
then it is formed by two infinity null cones, one for the future and
another for the past, with base
FORMULA  and apexes FORMULA  and
FORMULA , resp., and timelike lines of future and past extremes
FORMULA  and FORMULA , resp., on each point of FORMULA 
(Figure 1).
(ii)
If FORMULA  then it is formed by
two copies, one for the future and another for the past, of the
Cauchy completion FORMULA  of FORMULA , and timelike lines
based on each point of FORMULA  which connect both copies
(Figure 2).
(iii)
If
FORMULA ,
FORMULA  then it is formed by
an infinity null cone for the future with base
FORMULA  and apex FORMULA , a copy
of FORMULA  for the past, and timelike lines based on each
point of FORMULA  which connect FORMULA  with
FORMULA  (Figure 3).
(iv)
If
FORMULA ,
FORMULA  then it is formed by
an infinity null cone for the past with base
FORMULA  and apex FORMULA , a copy
of FORMULA  for the future, and timelike lines based on
each point of FORMULA  which connect FORMULA  with
FORMULA  (Figure 4).

Moreover, FORMULA  is formed by two spaces FORMULA 
and FORMULA , attached at FORMULA  and
FORMULA , resp., with each FORMULA 
(FORMULA ) being FORMULA  or an unique point FORMULA :
concretely, FORMULA  if
FORMULA , and
FORMULA  if
FORMULA . Finally,
FORMULA  belongs to the Cauchy boundary FORMULA  if
and only if the extreme FORMULA  is finite.

In particular, the structure of the causal boundary for GRW
spacetimes depends on both, the spatial part FORMULA  and the scale
factor FORMULA . If the spatial part FORMULA  is complete
(FORMULA ), the boundary presents at each extreme
of the temporal interval FORMULA , either a spacelike cover
structure FORMULA  or a null cone with base FORMULA , depending
on the growth of the scale factor at each extreme. However, if the
spatial part FORMULA  is incomplete (FORMULA ),
the boundary will also contain timelike lines on each point of
FORMULA , reachable by observers of the universe in finite
proper time. Hence, the boundary is not necessarily time symmetric
and may contain regions of any causal character (null, timelike or
spacelike).

FORMULA  FLRW spacetimes:

By completeness, we are going to particularize previous result to
Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetimes, i.e. the
spatial part is now a geometric model. In this case, the spacetime
manifold FORMULA  is either FORMULA  if FORMULA  or
FORMULA  if FORMULA . In local coordinates, the line
element reads
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the scale factor and
FORMULA 
Therefore, Theorem REF  gives:
Theorem 4.3 
The causal boundary of a FLRW spacetime, FORMULA ,
FORMULA  with FORMULA  or FORMULA ,
has the following structure:
(i)
If
FORMULA 
then it is formed by two infinity null cones, one for the future and
another for the past, with base FORMULA  and apex FORMULA  and
FORMULA , resp., if FORMULA , or it is formed just by
FORMULA , FORMULA  if FORMULA .
(ii)
If
FORMULA  then it is formed by
two spacelike copies, one for the future and another for the past,
of FORMULA  if FORMULA , or FORMULA  if FORMULA .
(iii)
If
FORMULA ,
FORMULA  then it is formed by
an infinity null cone for the future with base FORMULA  and apex
FORMULA  and a copy of FORMULA  for the past if FORMULA , or
it is formed by FORMULA  for the future and a copy of FORMULA  for
the past if FORMULA .
(iv)
If
FORMULA ,
FORMULA  then it is formed by
an infinity null cone with base FORMULA  and apex FORMULA  and a copy
of FORMULA  for the future if FORMULA , or it is formed by
FORMULA  for the past and a copy of FORMULA  for the future if
FORMULA .


Proof. If FORMULA , the spatial part is
FORMULA 
In particular, FORMULA  falls under the hypotheses of Proposition
REF . Therefore, the conclusion directly follows from Theorem
REF  and the integrals
FORMULA 
(Obviously, we have ignored the boundary region at FORMULA .)
Assume now that FORMULA . In this case, FORMULA , and thus,
the spatial part does not fall under the hypotheses of Proposition
REF . However, from Remark REF  the first part of Theorem
REF  still holds. Whence, the conclusion directly
follows from FORMULA 
and FORMULA .  FORMULA

An immediate application of this result gives the causal boundary
for Einstein Static Universe. This spacetime is a FLRW model
with base FORMULA , fiber FORMULA  and scale factor
FORMULA . Therefore, taking into account that
FORMULA : the causal
boundary of ESU is formed by the points, FORMULA , FORMULA . In this
case, the weak (indeed, null) asymptotic growth of the scale factor
implies degeneration of the boundary in two unique points. On the
opposite side we have de Sitter spacetime. This is a FLRW
model with base FORMULA , fiber FORMULA  and scale factor
FORMULA . Therefore, taking into account that
FORMULA :
the causal boundary of de Sitter spacetime is formed by two
spacelike copies of FORMULA , one for the past and another for the
future. So, it is the strong asymptotic growth of the scale factor
FORMULA  which produces this big boundary.

Conclusions
The main result in this paper is Theorem REF , which
describes the causal boundary for product spacetimes of a Lorentz
interval and a Riemannian manifold. The huge conformal class of
these spacetimes, which includes both, (standard) static spacetimes
and Generalized Robertson-Walker spacetimes, makes this result
specially useful to deduce the boundary of multiple classical
spacetimes. In particular, we have explicitly described the causal
boundary for Reissner-Nordstrom (including Schwarzschild), Anti-de
Sitter, Taub and standard cosmological models as de Sitter spacetime
and Einstein Static Universe.
In this paper we have used the formulation of the causal boundary
introduced in {{cite:fe643458-a465-49bc-84f6-5b5288174e3d}}, and modified later in {{cite:cbab7c27-cf84-4947-ab34-c38380362dfd}}. As
consequence, we have tested this new formulation for the classical
spacetimes previously cited. In particular, we have found that the
causal boundary essentially reproduces the structure of the
conformal boundary in these cases: right identifications between the
temporal lines of the boundary, expected dimensionality for the
singular regions, satisfactory topology for the completion...
This paper can be considered a very initial step in the ambitious
project of describing the causal boundary of spacetimes FORMULA  with metric FORMULA , where FORMULA  may depend on time.
As an indication of the importance and generality of this problem,
just recall that any globally hyperbolic spacetime admits this
decomposition, see {{cite:63e376d2-b9ff-4407-b506-e38cb6277fd7}}. Another step within this program may
consist of completing the results about the boundary of multiwarped
spacetimes in {{cite:62270553-73b8-4e35-a696-57cba6482f0c}}. These spacetimes are very interesting
because, apart from including certain regions of Schwarzschild and
Reissner-Nordstrom uncovered in this paper, they also include
Bianchi type IX spacetimes (as Kasner), spacetimes with internal
degrees of freedom attached at every point and multidimensional
inflationary models.
