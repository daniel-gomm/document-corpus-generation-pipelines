GRB 051022 was undetected to deep limits in early optical
observations, but precise astrometry from radio and X-ray showed
that it most likely originated in a galaxy at FORMULA . We
report radio, optical, near infra-red and X-ray observations of
GRB 051022. Using the available X-ray and radio data, we model the
afterglow and calculate the energetics of the afterglow, finding it
to be an order of magnitude lower than that of the prompt emission.
The broad-band modeling also allows us to precisely define various
other physical parameters and the minimum required amount of
extinction, to explain the absence of an optical afterglow. Our
observations suggest a high extinction, at least FORMULA  magnitudes in
the infrared (FORMULA ) and at least 5.4 magnitudes in the optical (FORMULA ) in
the host-galaxy restframe. Such high extinctions are unusual for
GRBs, and likely indicate a geometry where our line of sight to the
burst passes through a dusty region in the host that is not directly
co-located with the burst itself.
gamma rays: bursts — dust, extinction
Introduction
Dark gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) — at the most basic level those without
optical afterglows — are a long-standing issue in GRB observations.
Although in many cases the non-detection of an afterglow at optical
wavelengths may simply be due to an insufficiently deep search, or one
which takes place at late times {{cite:74cba95b-10c0-4558-8d52-6a7a54b2aae7}}, a
subset of GRBs with bright X-ray afterglows remains undetected despite
prompt and deep optical searches {{cite:3b9144aa-59a3-4eb7-9440-5e2c909f267f}}
and directly implies suppression of the optical light.
There are several plausible explanations for this, the most likely
being that the burst is at high redshift, such that the Ly-alpha break
has crossed the passband in question, or that there is high extinction
in the direction of the GRB. Examples of both have been found, with a
small number of GRBs at FORMULA  appearing as FORMULA  and FORMULA  band dropouts
{{cite:eba28b34-59bb-45be-a0cc-35a74f14010c}}, {{cite:d8d5cc2e-2cf0-4640-b318-f295b13722a2}} and
some GRB afterglows appearing very red at lower redshift, due to
effects of extinction
{{cite:3a59db52-c152-4818-a97c-089d556a6e19}}, {{cite:775af546-54fb-4fa1-ad64-908fc2562784}}.
Identification of GRBs at very high redshifts is the key to using them
as cosmological probes. The proportion of bursts exhibiting
high dust extinction is also interesting from the point of view of
estimating the proportion of star formation that
is dust enshrouded, as well as understanding the environments
which favor GRB production {{cite:b3ec7453-c00d-41f9-975a-df8e0d454499}}, {{cite:fe011016-c688-4d80-af28-d3bf3010abb2}}.
The detection and follow-up of dark bursts at other
wavelengths is essential, as it enables 1) the modeling of the
afterglow, deriving estimates of the extinction and energies involved,
potentially providing information about the direct burst environment, 2)
pinpointing the burst position in the host, to enable late-time
high resolution imaging and the detection of dust enhanced regions in
the host, and 3) determination of the properties of the GRB host itself,
such as the SFR and average host-galaxy extinction.
The High Energy Transient Explorer 2 mission (HETE-2;
{{cite:5c932213-6377-4cd9-9f2f-c58bb04fdb2e}}) detected and located an unusually
bright gamma-ray burst {{cite:ebc310da-deb0-4c76-89a4-0cc897adcd05}}
with its three main instruments, the French Gamma Telescope (FREGATE),
the Wide field X-ray monitor (WXM) and the Soft X-ray Camera, (SXC), on
October 22, 2005. A 2.5 arcminute localization was sent out within
minutes, enabling prompt follow-up observations
{{cite:dc882179-fecc-423e-988a-916f22b2945b}}, {{cite:399c6844-e68d-48b3-ac48-08ee0090fe4b}}; a
target-of-opportunity observation was also performed with Swift.
Details of the HETE-2 observations can be found in
{{cite:39127288-e831-43b0-9a0f-a64323682873}}.
The Swift observations resulted in the detection of a single fading
point source inside the SXC error region, which was consequently
identified as the X-ray afterglow of GRB 051022 {{cite:40c88624-7ae4-4217-98fe-a82f5d3f854e}}. However, optical and near infra-red (nIR)
observations failed to reveal any afterglow to deep limits, while
radio and millimeter observations with the Very Large Array (VLA), the
Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) and the Plateau de Bure
Interferometer detected the radio counterpart
{{cite:9886b905-7a7b-47b7-ad98-f022f520cf16}}, {{cite:e2a6eced-7dc0-4a1e-ba1b-9c07fe3951e4}}, {{cite:5e416485-4823-4b51-8e0e-2fb186b11db2}}.
The position coincides with its likely host galaxy
{{cite:bf9502e3-4da8-401d-880a-7ffe0d01a063}} at a redshift of FORMULA 
{{cite:d1506256-14fe-47d7-a10d-2939c1752222}}.
In this paper, we describe our X-ray, optical, nIR and radio
observations of [GRB 051022]GRB 051022. The outline of the
paper is as follows: in Section  we describe our
observations, data reduction and initial results. In Section
, we analyze these results and form our
afterglow picture, which is discussed in Section
. Our findings are summarized in Section
.
In the following, we have used FORMULA  in
our definition of FORMULA  and FORMULA . We assume a cosmology with
FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA . All quoted errors in this paper
are 1 sigma (68%) errors.

Observations and data reduction
X-ray observations
X-ray observations were performed with the Swift X-Ray Telescope
(XRT) and the Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO).
The XRT started observing the afterglow of GRB 051022 3.46 hours after
the HETE-2 trigger, for a total effective integration time of 137 ks
between October 22 and November 6.
Observations were performed in Photon Counting (PC) mode, the most
sensitive observing mode. We reduced the data using the Swift software version 2.6 in the HEAsoft package version 6.2.0. Data were
obtained from the quick-look site and processed from level 1 to level
2 FITS files using the xrtpipeline tool in its standard
configuration. The first two orbits (until FORMULA  seconds
post burst) show pile-up and were therefore extracted with an annular
rather than circular region, with an inner radius of 19 and 12 for orbits 1 and 2, respectively, and an outer radius of 71.
Orbits 3 – 7 (FORMULA  – FORMULA  seconds) were
extracted with a circular region of 71 radius, and later
orbits were extracted using a 47 radius circle instead. The
data for the light curve were extracted between channels 100 and 1000,
corresponding to 1 and 10 keV, respectively; while the commonly used
range is 0.3 – 10 keV, the large absorption prevents the detection of
any data from the source below 1 keV. Otherwise, the procedure is
similar to that described in {{cite:b472df4a-0e61-4b45-99ab-d3b5c9292867}}.
Observations with the CXO started on October 25, 2005, 21:14:20, 3.34
days after the HETE trigger, for a total integration time of 20 ks
{{cite:8202b0f2-a80e-4ec1-ba9a-8324419c3d40}}. Data were reduced in a standard fashion
with the CIAO package.
We performed astrometry by matching X-ray sources with an optical
FORMULA -band image that was astrometrically calibrated to the 2MASS
catalog. Our CXO position is RA, Dec = 23:56:04.115, +19:36:24.04
(J2000), with positional errors of 0.33 and 0.12 for
the Right Ascension and Declination, respectively. This puts the
afterglow within 0.5 of the center of its host galaxy.
We modeled the XRT spectra with an absorbed power law in XSpec
{{cite:88a9ae16-065d-4fb4-afef-7c04d6ee7275}}, using data from the first seven orbits. A
good fit (FORMULA ) was obtained with a resulting
spectral energy index of FORMULA  and excess absorption
(at FORMULA  and for assumed Galactic abundances) of FORMULA  on top of the estimated
Galactic absorption at this position (FORMULA , {{cite:6985e9a8-834a-4ab8-8fe3-4dc9656205f1}}). The CXO data are
fully in agreement with these values, showing no change in the
spectrum over time between 0.3 and 3.3 days after the burst. The
absorption measured is far less than that measured by the HETE team in
their prompt data, FORMULA  {{cite:39127288-e831-43b0-9a0f-a64323682873}}. This could
indicate a change in absorption between the early (prompt)
measurements and those at the time of the XRT observations. For the
prompt emission spectrum, however, the values found by Konus-Wind
{{cite:496c7b84-f255-40c1-877c-e60b1ecebbc4}} are rather different than those found
by HETE-2, and may be the result of the lower energy cut-off for
FREGATE compared to Konus-wind. Alternatively, the fact that these
spectra are an average over the whole emission period may also result
in incorrect model parameters. In the two last cases, the FORMULA  in the
prompt emission could be as low as the XRT value and still produce an
equally well fit, but with slightly different model parameters.
For the XRT data, {{cite:fd03e572-94df-4812-8530-14ccc4afb5a4}} and
{{cite:39127288-e831-43b0-9a0f-a64323682873}} find a value somewhat higher than our
value (FORMULA  and FORMULA  respectively, when scaled by FORMULA ,
{{cite:7786603d-f60c-49d4-8639-0fa8ee874297}}). This difference could be explained by
a different count-binning or an updated XRT calibration used in our
modeling.
The XRT light curve count rates have been converted to 1–10 keV
fluxes using the results from our spectral modeling and calculating
the ratio of the flux and count rate at the logarithmic center of the
orbits. The 1 – 10 keV CXO flux was derived using the actual spectral fit.
A broken power law fit to the X-ray light curve results in FORMULA , FORMULA  and a break time of
FORMULA  ks, or around 1.27 days. The difference between
FORMULA  and FORMULA , and the fact that the spectral slope does
not change across the break (the CXO measurement is past the break),
are highly indicative that the observed break in the light curve is a jet
break. In Section REF , we perform full
modeling of the afterglow using the fireball model, indeed resulting
in a jet-break time FORMULA  that agrees reasonably well with the break time as
determined from only the X-rays. We point out that our value for
FORMULA  is different than that cited in {{cite:feee57a9-d9c5-4e2d-ae20-bf557048b00d}},
largely because their measurement of FORMULA  was based on a preliminary
XRT light curve.

Optical and near infra-red observations
Observations were obtained in FORMULA  and FORMULA -band with the William
Herschel Telescope (WHT) using the Auxiliary Port and the Prime Focus
Imaging Camera, respectively, in FORMULA  with
the Gemini South telescope using the GMOS instrument, in FORMULA  with
the Wide Field Camera on the United Kingdom InfraRed Telescope
(UKIRT), in FORMULA  with the DFOSC instrument on the Danish 1.54m
telescope and in FORMULA  and FORMULA  with the Southern Astrophysical
Research (SOAR) telescope using OSIRIS. The optical data were reduced
in a standard fashion using the ccdproc package within the
IRAF software {{cite:99123077-9f5c-40da-99f1-378f286c4368}}, whereas the SOAR data were
reduced using the cirred package within IRAF. The UKIRT
data were reduced using the standard pipeline reduction for WFCAM.
Photometric calibration was done using the calibration provided by
{{cite:6e146981-79ff-404f-9a3e-a8e0f93ae465}} for Johnson-Cousins filters. For the
FORMULA  GMOS filters, we converted the
magnitudes of the calibration stars provided by Henden to the Sloan
filter system using the transformations provided by
{{cite:feee335b-491a-46d3-8c93-daa3802902c0}}, and verified by the published GMOS zero
points. The WHT FORMULA -band was calibrated using the spectroscopic
standard star SP2323+157. Calibration of the infrared FORMULA 
magnitudes was done using the 2MASS catalog
{{cite:8891daf1-e8fe-4b33-add5-2b81177c4b6e}}.
No variable optical source was found at the position of the X-ray and
radio afterglow. For the early epoch images (FORMULA  day post burst), we
estimated a limiting magnitude by performing image subtraction between
this and a later image using the ISIS image subtraction package
{{cite:6ec7d5e3-d682-4752-b243-f6fafd000faf}}. To this end, artificial low signal-to-noise
sources were added onto the images, with a Gaussian PSF matched in
size to the seeing (some artificial sources were added on top of
existing sources, e.g. galaxies, some on the background sky). We
determined our upper limit to be the point where we could retrieve
50% of the artificial sources in the subtracted image. This assumes that
the change in brightness of any point source on top of the host
galaxy is sufficient to be seen in such a subtracted image. With the
difference in time between the epochs, this seems a reasonable
assumption (for example, for a source fading with a shallow power law like
slope of FORMULA , the magnitude difference between the
two WHT FORMULA -band observations is FORMULA  magnitudes).
Photometry of the host galaxy has been performed using aperture
photometry, with an aperture 1.5 times the seeing for each image,
estimated from the measured FWHM of the PSF for point sources in the
images.
Table REF  shows the log of our optical/nIR
observations, while Table REF  shows the upper limits
for any optical/nIR afterglow.

Radio observations
Radio observations were performed with the WSRT at 8.4 GHz, 4.9 GHz
and 1.4 GHz. We used the Multi Frequency Front Ends
{{cite:c9f9e95b-4631-4e65-a238-37f2e86c964b}} in combination with the IVC+DZB back
endSee sect. 5.2 at
http://www.astron.nl/wsrt/wsrtGuide/node6.html in continuum mode,
with a bandwidth of 8x20 MHz. Gain and phase calibrations were
performed with the calibrators 3C 286 and 3C 48, although at one 8.4
GHz measurement 3C 147 was used. Reduction and analysis were performed
using the MIRIAD software
packagehttp://www.atnf.csiro.au/computing/software/miriad.
The observations are detailed in Table REF . In our

Analysis
Broadband modeling
We have performed broadband modeling of the X-ray and radio
measurements, using the methods presented in {{cite:3bc834b8-35dd-408e-adc0-3dbe22ce6791}}. In our modeling we assume a purely
synchrotron radiation mechanism.
The relativistic blastwave causing the afterglow accelerates electrons
to relativistic velocities, which gives rise to a broadband spectrum
with three characteristic frequencies: the peak frequency FORMULA ,
corresponding to the minimum energy of the relativistic electrons that
are accelerated by the blastwave, the cooling frequency FORMULA ,
corresponding to the electron energy at which electrons lose a
significant fraction of their energy by radiation on a timescale that
is smaller than the dynamical timescale, and the self-absorption
frequency FORMULA , below which synchrotron self-absorption produces
significant attenuation. The broadband spectrum is further
characterized by the specific peak flux FORMULA  and the slope FORMULA  of the electron
energy distribution.
The dynamics of the relativistic blastwave determine the temporal
behavior of the broadband synchrotron spectrum, i.e. the light curves
at given frequencies. At first the blastwave is extremely
relativistic, but is decelerated by the surrounding medium. When the
Lorentz factor FORMULA  of the blastwave becomes comparable to
FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the opening angle of the jet, the
jet starts to spread sideways. At that time, FORMULA , the temporal
behavior of the broadband spectrum changes {{cite:7786211e-40ff-417e-a834-6efa523c1e11}}.
We fit our data to six parameters: FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  and
FORMULA . From these parameters and the redshift of the burst, FORMULA , we can find the physical parameters governing the blastwave and
its surroundings: the blastwave isotropic equivalent energy FORMULA , the
jet opening angle FORMULA , the collimation corrected blastwave
energy FORMULA , the fractional energy densities behind the relativistic
shock in electrons and in the magnetic field, FORMULA  and FORMULA  respectively, and the density of the surrounding medium. The meaning
of the latter parameter depends on the density profile of the surrounding
medium. For a homogeneous circumburst medium, we simply determine the density
FORMULA . For a massive stellar wind, where the density is proportional to
FORMULA  with FORMULA  the distance to the GRB explosion center, we
obtain the parameter FORMULA , which is the ratio of the mass-loss
rate over the terminal wind velocity of the GRB progenitor.
Our modeling results are shown in Table REF , for
both the homogeneous external medium and the stellar wind environment.
The light curves for the best fit parameters are shown in Figure
REF . We have performed Monte Carlo simulations
with synthetic data sets in order to derive accuracy estimates of the
best fit parameters, which are also given in the table. It is evident
from the results that our six fit parameters are reasonably well
constrained in both cases for the circumburst medium. The derived
physical parameters are also well constrained, except for FORMULA  and
FORMULA . The values we find for both the isotropic and the collimation
corrected energy, are similar to those found for other bursts; this is
also true for FORMULA . See e.g. {{cite:78a16b44-0492-40b3-a1b3-59700500fd89}} and
{{cite:83548c09-95da-4a48-9eaf-a782bc62c20c}}. The jet opening angle and the density of
the surrounding medium are quite small, but both not unprecedented.
The jet-break time FORMULA  is somewhat smaller than estimated in
Section REF , but both estimates have relatively
large errors, likely because of the lack of (X-ray) data around the
jet-break time.
With the absence of optical light curves, it is not possible to
discriminate between the two different circumburst media. This is
mainly due to the fact that the X-ray band lies above both FORMULA  and
FORMULA , in which case the slopes of the light curves do not depend on
the density profile of the circumburst medium (even at 0.15 days,
back-extrapolating FORMULA  from Table REF  results in
its value being below the X-ray band). The FORMULA  is somewhat
better for the stellar wind case, but the homogeneous case cannot be
excluded. From the X-ray light curve, however, one can conclude that
the density profile of the medium does not change between
approximately 0.15 and 12 days after the burst. If there were a
transition from a stellar wind to a homogeneous medium, the X-ray flux
has to rise or drop significantly, unless the densities are the
fine-tuned at the transition point {{cite:c78c20a2-5c17-48a7-ad7b-9049e680d945}}. From
the fact that the medium does not change during the X-ray
observations, one can draw conclusions on the distance of the wind
termination shock of the massive star: if one assumes that the medium
is already homogeneous at FORMULA  days, the wind termination
shock position is at FORMULA  (0.32 pc); if the circumburst medium is a
stellar wind up to FORMULA  days after the burst, FORMULA  (3.7 pc).

The non-detection of the optical afterglow
It is quickly seen that GRB 051022 falls into the category of the
so-called “dark bursts”. Using, for example, the quick criterion
proposed by {{cite:e5c40ca6-d042-4d0b-9c8c-1d5e7bdaf788}}, we find FORMULA  at 12.7 hours after the burst using the Gemini FORMULA 
band observation, well below the proposed limit of FORMULA .
A more precise criterion would combine the available spectral and
temporal parameters of the X-ray afterglow, allow all valid
combinations, and from that infer the range of possible optical
magnitudes from the X-rays {{cite:ec4bd85c-0d38-404d-a948-8d9ecc735805}}.
This is, in fact implied in our previous modeling: the modeled
specific fluxes corresponding to the band and epoch of our optical and
nIR upper limits are listed in Table REF  (see
also Table REF ).
While the values in this table are given for local extinction, not
K-corrected to FORMULA , it is
immediately obvious that our FORMULA -band observations put a
stringent constraint on the required extinction directly surrounding
the burst.

To estimate the amount of local extinction in the host galaxy, we have
modeled the nIR to X-ray spectrum around 0.5 days after the burst,
considering 3 different extinction curves: those of the Milky Way
(MW), the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Small Magellanic Cloud
(SMC), from {{cite:032c8862-dd7d-4198-b390-ca76fe24bb74}}, with FORMULA  of 3.08, 3.16 and
2.93, respectively.
For this, we used the unabsorbed XRT flux obtained from the spectral
fit to orbits 3 – 7 (which do not contain piled-up data), and fixed
the energy spectral slope in the X-rays at FORMULA  (also from the
X-ray spectral fit). The optical specific fluxes were scaled to the
logarithmic mid-observation time of the X-ray observations with an
assumed FORMULA  decline. This estimated optical decay is
derived from the pre-break X-ray decay value, allowing for the cooling
break between the two wavelength regions, and averaging the two
possible values for FORMULA  (-0.25 and
0.25). We can further put the most stringent constraint on the broken
power law spectral shape, by setting the spectral break just below the
X-rays, at FORMULA  Hz, which follows from our previous
broad-band modeling. Our results indicate that, for the aforementioned
extinction curves, a local extinction of FORMULA  (for all
three extinction curves) is necessary to explain the FORMULA -band upper
limit.
We can relate the resulting FORMULA  from our X-ray spectral fits to any
local FORMULA , using the relations found in {{cite:15e23e31-90a9-406c-b068-b04769a8cc6e}},
{{cite:dcfc8a21-73e8-43b3-b045-b42f181c1051}} and {{cite:a32995c6-44f3-49a4-beab-218aafb8bd56}} for
FORMULA , and adjusting the metallicity in our X-ray absorption
model accordingly. We obtain FORMULA  and 0.84 for a MW, LMC
and SMC extinction curve respectively, with the MW value showing the
best agreement with our findings for optical extinction (both
{{cite:39127288-e831-43b0-9a0f-a64323682873}} and {{cite:3bb45b14-cc01-45db-a3e3-054ab95c4ed0}}
find FORMULA  values roughly twice as high here, for a MW extinction
curve only, since their FORMULA  estimate is larger than ours). This,
obviously, depends on the assumption that the MW (or otherwise, LMC or
SMC) extinction curves are valid models to compare with our observed
data here. Since these data happen to originate from just one sight
line in a galaxy, this may very well not be the case. Further, even
if the extinction curve is correct, the actual value of FORMULA  may be
rather different for the host galaxy. Finally, the FORMULA  – FORMULA  relations show a rather large scatter, especially at higher column
densities, nor is the FORMULA  always derived using X-ray spectroscopy.
Our above results are therefore approximations, which are useful to
compare with other (GRB host) studies, but should be taken with the
necessary caution.

Using the optical data described above, we fit the SED of the host of
GRB 051022 using the HyperZ programSee
http://webast.ast.obs-mip.fr/hyperz developed by
{{cite:394423cc-ac72-436a-9954-0a9d49a9ea22}}. The photometry of the host has been
performed using apphot within IRAF, in an aperture 1.5
times the estimated seeing in the different exposures. The results are
reported in Table REF  (see also
{{cite:61d28418-f291-43da-a694-2b9fac70d937}}). The range of photometric
magnitudes reported in this paper provides one of the most complete
broadband optical datasets of a GRB host galaxy to date. We fit using
the eight synthetic galaxy templates provided within HyperZ at the
redshift of the host, and find that the host galaxy is a blue compact
galaxy of type irregular, with a dominant stellar population age of
FORMULA  Myr, similar to other long GRB hosts
{{cite:cde2f619-6403-4098-b3fa-f2ac2c4eaf27}}. A moderate amount of extinction
of FORMULA  mag is required to fit the SED, with an SMC-type
extinction curve providing a best fit, and the luminosity of the host
is approximately 1.5 FORMULA  (assuming FORMULA ); these findings
are in full agreement with {{cite:1b4955a4-862b-486e-b8b9-a08fa0bec3db}}. The
amount of extinction in the line of sight towards the GRB required to
suppress the optical light of the afterglow to the observed limits is
clearly higher than the FORMULA  value found from the host SED: FORMULA  magnitudes towards the GRB, estimated from blueshifting our
measured (observer frame) FORMULA  band extinction to FORMULA .
The host galaxy SED extinction is, however, an average value derived
from the integrated colors of the host.
The host of GRB 051022 is located in a field crowded with galaxies of
various Hubble types. We perform photometry on several galaxies close
to the GRB host (within 1 arcminute) to investigate the possibility
that the high star formation rate seen in the optical
({{cite:1b4955a4-862b-486e-b8b9-a08fa0bec3db}} report an SFR of
FORMULA MFORMULA yrFORMULA ) is induced by a recent interaction
with one of the neighboring galaxies. As formation of high mass stars
has also been observed to occur in dusty regions in merging systems
{{cite:2d9c0fe7-83a5-436b-af05-f9b85112a2f9}}, this could help to explain the
excess optical extinction towards GRB 051022. We performed HyperZ
fits to these galaxies, and find that none of them is well fit by a
photometric redshift of FORMULA . Particularly the two galaxies
closest to the GRB host galaxy are not compatible with a redshift 0.8,
and show best fits with photometric redshifts of FORMULA  – 0.25. Out of the sample of six galaxies close to the GRB host
we find that four have best-fit photometric redshifts in the range
0.20 – 0.25, making it unlikely that a possible overdensity of
galaxies near the host galaxy is due to a cluster or galaxy group at
the host redshift.

Discussion
The issue of non-detected (“dark”) GRB afterglows has received
significant interest ever since the discovery of the first GRB
afterglow, starting with the non-detection of GRB 970828 to very deep
limits {{cite:3b9144aa-59a3-4eb7-9440-5e2c909f267f}}, {{cite:1975e9a1-3cd1-48d3-a663-6c1e7134cd5c}}. For this
particular afterglow, its non-detection has been attributed to a
dust-lane in its host galaxy {{cite:cc59fafe-c052-46f5-b4d9-2ea31abb597d}}. Dust
extinction as the cause of the non-detection of the optical afterglow
has been inferred in the case of several other GRBs, notably those
with a precise X-ray or radio position, where one can pinpoint the
afterglow position on top of its host galaxy (e.g. GRB 000210,
{{cite:3ca291f4-7fd2-4d38-a6d0-1b64af0f7f5f}}).
Optical drop-outs due to high redshift will also result in dark
bursts, but are harder to confirm, since it would require at least one
detection in a red band, to detect the LyFORMULA  break. Otherwise, it
becomes indistinguishable from dust extinction.
Other explanations of afterglow non-detections include the intrinsic
faintness of the afterglow. For HETE-2 detected GRBs, this has been
inferred for e.g. GRB 020819 {{cite:bd5b695a-028c-4696-b614-0f7590388f2f}}. For
Swift bursts, where rapid and accurate X-ray positions are often
available, this is a major cause of non-detections
{{cite:7470ad3e-f278-477e-bd91-84d2e119b8dc}}, largely attributed to a higher average
redshift.
In our case here, the host galaxy has been detected at a relatively
modest redshift, which almost automatically points to the dust
extinction scenario. The radio and X-ray detections even allow us to
accurately model the necessary amount of extinction between us and the
GRB.
The burst environment
The issue of the role of dust extinction in the lines of sight towards
GRBs is still very much an open one. While clear signs of dust
depletion are seen in several afterglow spectra, the FORMULA  values that
are predicted from these depletion measures are generally much higher
than the observed ones, that can be found from the continuum shape
{{cite:6f98adcf-17ce-4fd8-8961-eccf6d80e238}}. Recently, selected samples of GRB
afterglows were homogeneously analyzed for X-ray and optical
extinction, showing dust to gas ratios different from Galactic and
Magellanic cloud values
{{cite:c7d594cd-72d1-4890-a9c3-e966b1a1ce4b}}, {{cite:db9d891a-cbd3-4aba-9ed8-cf270239b8ac}}.
{{cite:2f07ecea-a0c3-49fc-bf6f-bdc75129abda}} and {{cite:5a885d95-446b-47f9-b0c9-9cf554b831a1}} had
already found dust (optical) to gas (X-ray) ratios to be lower than
the Galactic value (in all cases, however, there is a bias in
these samples to optically and X-ray detected afterglows). Comparison
of neutral hydrogen columns and metallicities of afterglow lines of
sight with X-ray extinction values {{cite:f1d14f30-f5fa-4cdf-a10b-818a9a86cded}}
showed that the absorption probed by these two wavelength regimes is
generally located at different positions in the host. In all these
cases there may be significant biases against bursts with low apparent
magnitudes, preventing optical spectroscopy, which are hard to
quantify.
In the case of GRB 051022  there is a significant discrepancy between
the extinction for the host as a whole and that along the line of
sight to the burst, or at least along our line of sight towards the
burst. This is perhaps not too surprising if one assumes, for example,
that the burst occurred inside a Giant Molecular Cloud (GMC).
{{cite:51248fd4-1111-46fb-80ac-9a3c07c9b4e5}} compared the GRB FORMULA (HI) distribution
to that of modeled GRBs located inside Galactic-like GMCs. They found
that the two distributions are incompatible, and possibly GRBs are
more likely to occur inside clouds with a lower FORMULA (HI), or
alternatively, outside the actual GMC. (Note that their study
concentrates on bursts with FORMULA , where the Ly-FORMULA  absorption
is visible in the optical wavebands; it is also biased towards
optically detected afterglows). A GMC could therefore actually be
positioned in front of the GRB, where the required optical and X-ray
extinction is easily achieved. This agrees with the findings by
{{cite:242bc541-7483-40d8-8649-5f4ad8fdeddd}}, who analyzed several
GRB-Damped Lyman Alpha spectra and from observed depletion levels
infer that the gas is not located directly near the GRB (e.g. its
molecular cloud) but further out. The specific case of GRB 060418
confirmed this through time-resolved high resolution spectroscopy,
showing that the observed metal lines originate past 1.7 kpc from the
burst itself {{cite:2af4d77a-ef31-47fa-a17d-b187f496397f}}. In fact, X-ray radiation
from the burst could easily destroy grains out to 100 pc
{{cite:b53b95e0-660c-4d8e-a60c-9e5864841cdb}}, {{cite:169893c4-0010-40ff-b8a6-e48c2e26edef}}, {{cite:c77b330c-be80-4dfb-9545-dbe63aaa1fd1}}
and permit the afterglow radiation to penetrate the surrounding
molecular cloud. Dust extinction is therefore likely to occur further
out, perhaps to several kiloparsecs.
It is interesting to find a non-SMC type of extinction curve from the
combination of X-ray and optical absorption (though not completely
ruled out): in most cases modeled, an SMC extinction curve fits the
optical–X-ray spectra best
{{cite:c7d594cd-72d1-4890-a9c3-e966b1a1ce4b}}, {{cite:db9d891a-cbd3-4aba-9ed8-cf270239b8ac}}, presumably
attributable to the absence of the 2175 Å feature
{{cite:eb130ef2-f422-4cb8-9fac-91cac331d7ed}} and the low dust to gas ratio. Our
findings indicate that the extinction along the line of sight to the
GRB will generally be different than one of the three assumed
extinction curves. Local small scale density variations in clouds,
such as found by from infrared studies in the Taurus region and from
simulations {{cite:fef4865e-859d-475c-969e-b6a440c80982}}, could cause this fairly
easily.

Energetics
Our modeling provides us with a detailed set of parameters of the
afterglow energetics, including FORMULA , the energy of the afterglow.
For the prompt emission energy, we use the data from the Konus-Wind
measurements {{cite:496c7b84-f255-40c1-877c-e60b1ecebbc4}}. We calculate a prompt
isotropic energy of FORMULA  erg in
the 20 keV – 20 MeV observer frame, and, by applying a K-correction
{{cite:c590a72d-24e4-4cfc-833e-8832243b3ceb}}, FORMULA  erg in the 1 – FORMULA  keV
rest frame. The collimation corrected energy depends on the assumed
density profile of the surrounding medium: for a homogeneous medium, we
obtain FORMULA  erg, and for a wind-like
medium, FORMULA  erg. With FORMULA  keV in the burst rest frame, we find that the
FORMULA  – FORMULA  relation {{cite:1d9a7426-b2e8-4fa7-9faa-7e0951c93601}}
somewhat underestimates the FORMULA  when calculated from FORMULA :
FORMULA  keV for a homogeneous medium, and FORMULA 
keV for a wind medium (the difference between our chosen cosmology and
that used by {{cite:1d9a7426-b2e8-4fa7-9faa-7e0951c93601}} amounts to only a
0.3% difference in FORMULA ). These estimates, however, come with a few
caveats: 1) the FORMULA  from the Konus-Wind data is calculated
using an exponential cut-off model, not the Band function
{{cite:4a2f5ad0-4560-4120-8412-9358b8592cf9}}. Since the Band function includes the case
of an exponential cut-off model (with FORMULA , this should,
however, pose no problem in estimating the actual FORMULA ), 2)
our break time, and therefore the jet-opening angle, are calculated
from the full modeling of the afterglow, which effectively means
derived from the available X-ray and radio data. Further, the original
Ghirlanda relation was derived using optical break times. Recent
efforts show that estimating jet-break times from X-ray light curves
may not lead to the same results
{{cite:ee8bca31-b4db-4d1b-b05d-d05efcea329a}}, and 3) the
relatively large error on the jet opening angle estimate allows for a
relatively large range in collimation corrected energies. We have
simply used here our best value, but an FORMULA  value of 1498 keV
derived from FORMULA  can still be accommodated within our errors. (We
note that, with a different FORMULA  estimate and an incorrect value
for the jet-break time, {{cite:39127288-e831-43b0-9a0f-a64323682873}} still found
their results to lie on the Ghirlanda relation). The break time
problem can be avoided by looking only at the FORMULA  – FORMULA  relation {{cite:b29d70e5-fc00-4153-9187-8878f2dc2503}}, {{cite:3b63ad72-12c4-4dcd-aa83-4549a025d6e4}}. From this,
we estimate FORMULA  keV, nicely in agreement with the
value found directly from the spectra fit.
Comparing the prompt emission energy (FORMULA ) and afterglow blast
wave kinetic energy (FORMULA ), we find their ratio to be FORMULA  in the case of a wind-like circumburst medium, while for
a homogeneous medium, FORMULA . These ratios are
similar to those found for other bursts {{cite:65426757-7f0e-4fd7-9a08-31da3f65e663}}.
GRB 051022 is also one of the brightest bursts observed by HETE, with a
prompt 30–400 keV fluence of FORMULA  erg cmFORMULA 
{{cite:39127288-e831-43b0-9a0f-a64323682873}}. In fact, compared to the sample of 35
FREGATE bursts analyzed by {{cite:50a73565-588b-44f8-8ead-849c802d5b3c}}, GRB 051022 has
the largest fluence, even topping the relatively close-by GRB 030329
({{cite:81f5ac91-3ab8-4458-a7da-a9a901df1993}}; note that for GRB 051022, its
redshift is close to the median redshift of HETE-2 detected GRBs and
therefore distance effects will play a very minor role).
{{cite:ec4bd85c-0d38-404d-a948-8d9ecc735805}} noted this potential correlation of fluence
with the non-detection of a GRB afterglow for the small subset of
genuinely dark bursts in their sample: the truly dark bursts all have
a much higher than average fluence (although this is for a relatively
small sample only). Potentially, this could point to an external
origin for the prompt emission, instead of being due to internal
shocks: a large amount of dust may result in more matter that will
radiate, while at the same time the radiation will be suppressed at UV
and optical wavelengths. This would indicate an origin of the
extinction quite close to the burst instead, in contrast to previous
findings for other bursts, as discussed in Section
REF . These latter bursts, however, were all
optically selected to obtain spectroscopy, and may therefore show
different surroundings than GRB 051022. Unfortunately, with the small
sample size of genuine dark bursts a firm conclusion on this
correlation is not possible, but remains something to watch for in
future dark bursts.

Conclusions
GRB 051022 is a prototypical dark burst, with the local extinction
exceeding FORMULA  magnitudes in FORMULA  and 5.4 magnitudes in FORMULA , in the
host-galaxy restframe, with the exact limits depending on the
circumburst density profile. The extinction curve derived from an
X-ray – optical spectral fit points towards a Galactic type of
extinction curve, although it is likely that this is more or less a
coincidence: the host galaxy itself is best modeled with an SMC-like
extinction curve, with a modest amount of extinction, FORMULA  mag. The large optical absorption towards the afterglow of
GRB 051022 is therefore probably the effect of an unfortunate
position in the host where the line of sight crosses dense regions
within the host.
The X-ray and radio afterglow data allow for a full solution of the
blastwave model, although we unfortunately cannot distinguish between
the density profile (homogeneous or wind-like) of the circumburst
medium. We estimate a collimation-corrected energy in the afterglow
emission of 0.92 – 2.3 FORMULA  erg, while the energy in
prompt emission (1 – FORMULA  keV rest frame) is 8.4 – 18 FORMULA  erg. Aside from the large optical extinction, the afterglow
otherwise appears as an average afterglow, with no outstanding
properties. The potentially interesting point here is that the
30-400 keV fluence of the prompt emission is one of the largest ever
detected in the HETE-2 sample.
In the era of Swift GRBs, dust-extincted bursts can actually be
found in optical/nIR thanks to the rapid availability of precise
positions: examples are found where the burst is relatively bright
early on at optical/nIR wavelengths, while the afterglow proper (post
few hours) often can go undetected

This allows targeted follow-up of such dark bursts, i.e. determining
the host galaxy (and the bursts precise position therein) and a
redshift measurement. In our case, a precise CXO and radio position
pinpointed the host galaxy, but such data may not always be available.
High resolution late-time observations of the host, at the location of
the GRB, may then reveal whether the burst indeed occurred inside a
dense host region.

Interstellar scintillation in the radio modeling
The 4.9 GHz measurements show scatter around the best fit light curve,
which can be accounted for by interstellar scintillation (ISS). In
Figure REF  we have indicated the predicted rms
scatter due to ISS. We have calculated the scattering measure from
the {{cite:d3ea7fce-eb7e-4b8e-a0cf-f787d7c50fa9}} model for the Galactic
distribution of free electrons: FORMULA . The radio specific flux will be
modulated when the source size is close to one of the three
characteristic angular scales, i.e. for weak, refractive or
diffractive ISS. From {{cite:232f5490-835c-459f-8392-28840d228f51}}, we calculate
the transition frequency between weak and strong ISS,
FORMULA , and the angular size of the first Fresnel
zone, FORMULA . Our
measurements were all performed at frequencies below FORMULA , i.e. in
the strong ISS regime, which means that only refractive and
diffractive ISS modulate the specific flux significantly. We calculate the
evolution of the source size in the extreme relativistic phase
(FORMULA ) and after the jet-break
(FORMULA ), and compare this source
size with the diffractive angular scale
FORMULA  and the refractive angular
scale
FORMULA  to calculate the modulation
index FORMULA . In the case of diffractive ISS the modulation
index is 1, and in the case of refractive ISS
FORMULA . Because of the expansion of the
blastwave the angular source size exceeds one of the characteristic
angular scales at some point in time. Then the modulation will begin
to quench as FORMULA  in
the case of diffractive ISS, and as
FORMULA  in the case
of refractive ISS.
