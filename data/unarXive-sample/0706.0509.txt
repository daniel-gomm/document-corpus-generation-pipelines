We employ the Monte Carlo particle collision code DPMJET3.04 to determine the multiplicity spectra of various secondary particles (in addition to FORMULA 's) with FORMULA 's as
the final decay state, that are produced in cosmic-ray (FORMULA 's and FORMULA 's) interactions with the interstellar medium. We derive an easy-to-use FORMULA -ray production matrix for cosmic rays
with energies up to about 10 PeV. This FORMULA -ray production matrix is applied to the GeV excess in diffuse Galactic FORMULA -rays
observed by EGRET, and we conclude the non-FORMULA  decay components are insufficient to explain the GeV excess, although they have contributed a different spectrum from
the FORMULA -decay component. We also test the hypothesis that the TeV-band FORMULA -ray emission of the shell-type SNR RX J1713.7-3946
observed with HESS is caused by hadronic cosmic rays which are accelerated by a cosmic-ray modified shock. By the FORMULA  statistics, we find a continuously softening
spectrum is strongly preferred, in contrast to expectations. A hardening spectrum has about 1% probability to explain the HESS data, but then only if a hard
cutoff at 50-100 TeV is imposed on the particle spectrum.
FORMULA -ray production matrix in hadronic Interactions
This work presents a careful study of the FORMULA -ray production in cosmic-ray (both FORMULA  and FORMULA ) interactions, by accounting for all decay processes including
the direct production. For that purpose we employ the
event generator DPMJET-III {{cite:d53621c4-3f98-46b0-95b1-1fdfe769485e}} to simulate secondary productions in both p-generated and
He-generated interactions. We include all relevant secondary particles with FORMULA -rays as the
final decay products. For the composition of the ISM, we assume 90% protons, 10% helium nuclei, 0.02% carbon, and 0.04% oxygen.
Around the energy of FORMULA  production threshold, where DPMJET appears unreliable, we apply a parametric model {{cite:08a9b320-94c5-4ada-9e40-d103228ca36a}},
that includes the resonance production for the FORMULA  production. We thus derive a FORMULA -ray production matrix for cosmic rays
with energies up to about 10 PeV that can be easily used to interpret the spectra of cosmic FORMULA -ray sources.
We consider all the decay channels and their decay fractions published by the Particle Data Group to account for all secondaries (resonances included) calculated
by DPMJET and the parametric method. The calculation shows the non-FORMULA  resources in hadronic interactions have contributed about 20% of the total FORMULA -ray
photons, mostly from directly produced FORMULA -rays and decays of FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  {{cite:f36e06ba-7e31-4bd1-bd8a-1509b06c225e}}.
In the cosmic-ray interactions, we calculate the FORMULA -ray spectrum contributed by decays of unstable secondary particles
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the FORMULA -ray decay spectrum from secondary species FORMULA . Eq. (REF ) can be re-written into
FORMULA 
thus reducing this problem to a matrix operation with the FORMULA -ray production matrix FORMULA  for which, each element FORMULA  shows the value of
the resultant particle energy spectrum FORMULA , with FORMULA  being the index for the generating cosmic-ray particle (FORMULA  or FORMULA )
and FORMULA  being the index indicating the FORMULA -ray energy. The energy binnings FORMULA  and FORMULA  are defined with good resolutions {{cite:f36e06ba-7e31-4bd1-bd8a-1509b06c225e}}.
We use the FORMULA -ray production matrix to analyze the observed spectra of diffuse Galactic emission and of the shell-type SNR RX J1713.7-3946. We find that
the GeV excess is probably not the result of an inappropriate model of hadronic FORMULA -ray production. We also test the hypothesis that the TeV-band FORMULA -ray
emission of SNR RX J1713.7-3946 observed with HESS is caused by hadronic cosmic rays that have a spectrum according to current theories of cosmic-ray
modified shock acceleration.

Application: the GeV-band FORMULA -ray spectrum and the TeV-band spectrum of RX J1713.7-3946
With the FORMULA -ray production matrix, we calculate the diffuse FORMULA -ray spectrum generated by the observed cosmic-ray spectrum {{cite:b52150dd-dcb2-4b87-a14a-7524559b7a5e}}.
Fig. REF  (Left) shows the observed GeV-band FORMULA -ray emission from the inner Galaxy {{cite:e3c19a6d-3057-496f-abf5-1cbbae1e0536}} in comparison with the contributions
from FORMULA  decay as well as bremsstrahlung emission describe by a power-law spectrum FORMULA :
FORMULA 
with power-law spectral index FORMULA , the electron energy density
FORMULA , and the gas column density
FORMULA , respectively.
The generating cosmic-rays are assumed with an energy
density FORMULA .
Models based on the locally observed cosmic-ray spectra generally
predict a softer spectrum for the leptonic components, even after accounting for inverse
Compton emission {{cite:e3c19a6d-3057-496f-abf5-1cbbae1e0536}}, so we may in fact overestimate the GeV-band intensity
of the leptonic contribution.
Nevertheless, it is clearly seen in this figure, that in the total intensity an over-shooting around
FORMULA  appears in the modelled FORMULA -ray energy
distribution, whereas a deficit is present above 1 GeV. The observed spectrum of diffuse emission is
always harder than the model spectrum, and we therefore conclude that an inaccurate description of
hadronic FORMULA -rays is ruled out as the origin of the GeV excess.
For the TeV-band FORMULA -ray spectrum of the shell-type SNR J1713.7-3946 observed by the HESS collaboration {{cite:a6d0cf39-ef40-4116-8073-f83d64c8c348}}, we use the
FORMULA -ray production matrix to test cosmic-ray acceleration models {{cite:bb385d63-e4fc-4d29-854e-841cf3b1cf7e}}, {{cite:be547da8-9a52-4cd9-a245-d8228b4cb3fb}}, which predict a continuous hardening of the cosmic-ray spectrum up to a
high-energy cutoff. We therefore parametrize the spectrum of accelerated hadrons as
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the step function and FORMULA  TeV is a normalization chosen to render variations in the power-law index FORMULA  statistically independent from the
choice of spectral curvature, FORMULA . The cutoff energy, FORMULA , is a free parameter. The normalization FORMULA  is obtained by normalizing
both the data and the model to the value at 0.97 TeV. By the FORMULA  statistics, we obtain the best-fitting values and the confidence
ranges of the three parameters, FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA , given values as FORMULA , FORMULA ,
and FORMULA  TeV, i.e. no cutoff. The best fit, shown in Fig. REF  (Right), involves a continuous softening and is thus not
commensurate with expectations based on acceleration at a cosmic-ray modified shock {{cite:bb385d63-e4fc-4d29-854e-841cf3b1cf7e}}, {{cite:be547da8-9a52-4cd9-a245-d8228b4cb3fb}}. Noted that very valuable would be data in the energy
range between 1 GeV and 200 GeV that may be provided by GLAST in the near future. Fig. REF  shows the confidence ranges of the parameters in Eq. (REF ),
with confidence levels of 1, 2 and 3 sigma. The analysis strongly suggests a negative spectral curvature, FORMULA , with confidence more than 95%, in contrast to
the expectation of standard cosmic-ray modified shock models.

Conclusion
We have considered a full picture of the hadronic FORMULA -rays in cosmic-ray interactions and introduced an easy-to-use FORMULA -ray production matrix which can be
used for arbitrary cosmic-ray spectrum. The matrices are available for download at website http://cherenkov.physics.iastate.edu/gamma-prod.
We apply the production matrix to calculate the FORMULA -ray GeV excess and also the TeV-band spectrum of SNR RX J1713.7-3946. We conclude that 1) the modifications in
the GeV-band FORMULA -ray emission of
hadronic origin are insufficient to explain the GeV excess in diffuse galactic FORMULA -rays; 2) a soft cut-off at about 100 TeV is statistically required in the
particle spectrum if the TeV-band spectrum of RX J1713.7-3946 as observed with HESS is caused by cosmic-ray nucleons; 3) no evidence for efficient nucleon acceleration
to energies near the knee in the cosmic-ray spectrum, nor evidence of the spectral curvature and hardness predicted by standard models of cosmic-ray modified shock
acceleration. We emphasize the need for GLAST data to better constrain the FORMULA -ray spectrum below 100 GeV.
