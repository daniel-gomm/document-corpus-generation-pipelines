Introduction
Let FORMULA  be a finite Coxeter
group with set of distinguished generators FORMULA ,
length function FORMULA ,
and Bruhat order FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be the asymptotic Hecke algebra
of FORMULA , as defined by Lusztig in
{{cite:e7da283d-6424-4c14-9dbf-d4c78d56d746}} (see also
{{cite:c1498bc2-4e91-4cdb-9c5f-b40b63266893}}). As an
additive group,
FORMULA  is a free abelian group with basis
FORMULA  indexed by FORMULA .
The multiplication
operation of FORMULA  is given by
FORMULA 
where the structure constants
FORMULA 
are described in the next section.
It is known that FORMULA  is an associative ring
with identity.
Moreover,
if FORMULA  is a left cell of FORMULA , then
FORMULA 
is a FORMULA -subalgebra of FORMULA .
We denote this ring FORMULA .
Fokko du Cloux
has computed FORMULA 
for all FORMULA .
In fact,
du Cloux has determined all of the coefficients,
not just the leading coefficients,
of the structure constants FORMULA  of
the Hecke algrebra: see {{cite:b8e593e3-6e2d-4889-8f4b-f5a2517b99b6}}.
By du Cloux's calculations, the coefficients
of the FORMULA  are nonnegative integers.
Since the same is known for the
Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials,
results of Lusztig ({{cite:c1498bc2-4e91-4cdb-9c5f-b40b63266893}})
show that all of the conjectures of
{{cite:c1498bc2-4e91-4cdb-9c5f-b40b63266893}},
hold in type FORMULA .
In particular, each left cell FORMULA 
of FORMULA  contains a unique element
of FORMULA , the set of distinguished
involutions. Moreover, if
FORMULA ,
then FORMULA  is the identity element of
FORMULA .
In the current investigation, the
structure constants FORMULA 
are needed only
for FORMULA ,
FORMULA  a left cell of FORMULA .
These constants
were calculated by computer using
the algorithm described in Section 2,
which differs from that used by du Cloux.
There are a total of 206 left cells in
type FORMULA  ({{cite:b06ac8f9-f8a2-4786-9280-fab3e65da1cd}}).
For FORMULA  a
left cell of FORMULA , the associated
FORMULA -graph gives rise to a corresponding
FORMULA -module as in {{cite:715d1f09-5ebf-40f5-87d3-d3033bc03d56}},
which will be denoted
FORMULA .
We say a bijection
FORMULA 
is a
permutation isomorphism
from FORMULA  to FORMULA  if
FORMULA 
for all
FORMULA .
A computer search of the matrices
of structure constants reveals the following
result. (The author knows of no a priori
proof of this result.)
Theorem 1.1 Suppose FORMULA  is of type FORMULA  and
FORMULA , FORMULA  are left cells of FORMULA 
such that the corresponding modules
FORMULA , FORMULA  are isomorphic.
Then there is a unique permutation
isomorphism
from
FORMULA  to
FORMULA .

For a left cell FORMULA  not in the largest
two-sided cell FORMULA , we have
FORMULA  or 2,
and hence FORMULA  is easily described (see Section 3).
Thus the interesting cases are those
for which FORMULA . There are
three isomorphism classes of modules
FORMULA , FORMULA , represented
by FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  (in the notation
of {{cite:b06ac8f9-f8a2-4786-9280-fab3e65da1cd}}).
Sections 4–6 describe the rings FORMULA 
for these cases. A CAS program was used to find
a set of generators over FORMULA , the
characteristic polynomials for the left multiplication
operators FORMULA ,
and the subsets of
FORMULA 
spanning subalgebras of FORMULA .
The author is indebted to Victor Ostrik for suggesting
this problem, and to George Lusztig and Victor Ostrik
for several helpful communications.

The computation of the structure constants
Let FORMULA , FORMULA  be as in the previous section.
Let FORMULA  be the corresponding Hecke algebra
over FORMULA ,
FORMULA  an indeterminate, with standard basis
FORMULA  satisfying
FORMULA 
for FORMULA , FORMULA .
(This notation of {{cite:c1498bc2-4e91-4cdb-9c5f-b40b63266893}} differs
slightly from that in {{cite:715d1f09-5ebf-40f5-87d3-d3033bc03d56}}.)
The semilinear involution FORMULA 
of FORMULA  is given by FORMULA ,
FORMULA .
The basis
FORMULA  for
FORMULA  (denoted
FORMULA 
in {{cite:715d1f09-5ebf-40f5-87d3-d3033bc03d56}}) satisfies
FORMULA 
where FORMULA 
when FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  when FORMULA ,
and
FORMULA .
For FORMULA ,
define FORMULA  by
FORMULA 
Then FORMULA  is determined
by
FORMULA 
({{cite:c1498bc2-4e91-4cdb-9c5f-b40b63266893}}), where
FORMULA  is a nonnegative integer depending
only on the two-sided cell containing FORMULA 
(see below).
Now, if FORMULA  are given by
FORMULA 
then
FORMULA 
by {{cite:c1498bc2-4e91-4cdb-9c5f-b40b63266893}},
where
FORMULA  is the inverse matrix
of
FORMULA .
Further, if FORMULA  is finite then
FORMULA 
by {{cite:c1498bc2-4e91-4cdb-9c5f-b40b63266893}},
where FORMULA  is the longest element of FORMULA  and
FORMULA .
Put
FORMULA ,
and let
FORMULA 
so FORMULA 
is the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial for FORMULA , FORMULA .
Define
FORMULA 
Then
FORMULA 
Therefore
formula (REF ) is equivalent to
FORMULA 
To find the structure constants
FORMULA 
for FORMULA  in type FORMULA ,
the polynomials
FORMULA  were evaluated by computer for a
fixed FORMULA 
and all FORMULA , FORMULA ,
using a
straightforward calculation based on
(REF ).
The leading term of the sum on the left
side of (REF ) was then found for
FORMULA , using the
Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials computed in the
course of determining the left cells
in {{cite:b06ac8f9-f8a2-4786-9280-fab3e65da1cd}}.
Varying FORMULA 
over FORMULA  produced the
value of the FORMULA -function on FORMULA :
if FORMULA  denotes the degree of the
left side of (REF ) and
FORMULA 
then FORMULA  for FORMULA .
Once the value FORMULA  had been found,
the structure constants FORMULA 
were then determined using (REF ).
The results of these calculations are summarized
in the next sections.

Small left cells
For the remainder of this paper
FORMULA  is of type FORMULA .
The notations of {{cite:b06ac8f9-f8a2-4786-9280-fab3e65da1cd}} are used
for the left and two-sided cells.
(There is a typographic error in {{cite:b06ac8f9-f8a2-4786-9280-fab3e65da1cd}}:
the left cell FORMULA  is equal to FORMULA ,
not FORMULA .)
In particular, the two-sided cells of FORMULA 
are FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , with
FORMULA  the “big” cell.
If FORMULA  is contained in one
of the two-sided cells FORMULA , FORMULA  or FORMULA , then
FORMULA .
In this case FORMULA 
where FORMULA ,
and FORMULA .
Now suppose FORMULA  is contained in one
of the two-sided cells FORMULA , FORMULA , or FORMULA .
In this case
FORMULA ,
and
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the distinguished involution
and FORMULA  is the other involution in FORMULA .
Then
FORMULA 
with identity element FORMULA .
Moreover, the calculations described in
Section 2 show
FORMULA 
From these results and the structure of the
modules FORMULA  given in {{cite:b06ac8f9-f8a2-4786-9280-fab3e65da1cd}},
Theorem REF  holds
for left cells FORMULA  not contained in FORMULA .

The case  FORMULA
It remains only to consider the left cells
FORMULA  such that
FORMULA .
Suppose FORMULA  is the left cell FORMULA , so
FORMULA  and
FORMULA  ({{cite:b06ac8f9-f8a2-4786-9280-fab3e65da1cd}}).
Let
FORMULA , where
FORMULA .
The elements FORMULA , ..., FORMULA  of
FORMULA  are indexed
according to the
list of reduced expressions given in
Table REF .
TABLE 
The structure constants
FORMULA  are described below
by giving matrices
FORMULA , ..., FORMULA , where
for fixed FORMULA , FORMULA  is the
matrix FORMULA ,
with FORMULA  and FORMULA  varying over
FORMULA  in the order given in
Table REF .
Note that FORMULA  is the transpose of the
left multiplication operator
FORMULA .
To save space, only a set of generators is
given explicitly, and the other matrices
are then described in terms of those
generators.
The calculations described in
Section 2 yield FORMULA , the identity matrix,
so FORMULA  is the distinguished involution of FORMULA .
Also,
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
Moreover,
FORMULA

FORMULA 
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
This completes the description of the multiplication structure
constants when FORMULA .
After similar calculations were carried out
for the left cells FORMULA ,..., FORMULA ,
a computer search established the
corresponding cases of Theorem REF .
In addition, we have the following.
Theorem 4.1 Suppose FORMULA  and
FORMULA  is a nonempty subset of FORMULA .
Then
FORMULA  is a subring (with 1) of
FORMULA  if and only if
FORMULA  is one of the sets
FORMULA ,
FORMULA ,
FORMULA .

The characteristic polynomials of
the matrices FORMULA  appear in Table REF .

The case  FORMULA
In this section FORMULA  is the left cell FORMULA 
of FORMULA , so
FORMULA  and
FORMULA .
We use a adapt the notation of the previous section
to this case.
The elements FORMULA , ..., FORMULA  of
FORMULA  are indexed as in
Table REF .
TABLE 
Let FORMULA  be the FORMULA -matrix
FORMULA .
Then
FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
by the calculations described in
Section 2.
Further,
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
This completes the description of the structure constants
for the left cell FORMULA .
As before, after the structure constants for
FORMULA ,...,FORMULA  were also computed,
the relevant cases of Theorem REF  were verified by a
computer search.
We also have the following.
Theorem 5.1 Suppose FORMULA  and
FORMULA  is a nonempty subset of FORMULA .
Then
FORMULA  is a subring (with 1) of
FORMULA  if and only if
FORMULA  is one of the sets
FORMULA 

The characteristic polynomials of
the matrices FORMULA  appear in
Table REF .
TABLE 

The case  FORMULA
Suppose FORMULA  is the left cell FORMULA .
Thus
FORMULA  and
FORMULA .
A notation similar to that in the previous
two sections is used for the elements of
FORMULA  and the matrices
of structure constants.
Table REF  lists the
elements FORMULA , ..., FORMULA  of
FORMULA .

Let FORMULA  be the FORMULA  matrix
FORMULA .
Then

Also,

FORMULA 
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
As before, a computer search was used to verify the cases
of Theorem REF  corresponding to left cells with
FORMULA -modules isomorphic to FORMULA .
Moreover, the following holds.
Theorem 6.1 Suppose FORMULA 
and
FORMULA  is a nonempty subset of FORMULA .
Then
FORMULA  is a subring (with 1) of
FORMULA  if and only if
FORMULA  is one of sets
FORMULA 

Table REF  contains the characteristic polynomials
of the matrices FORMULA .

Concluding remarks
We consider the effect of extending scalars to
FORMULA .
It is known that FORMULA  is a splitting
field for FORMULA  and FORMULA  is a splitting
field for FORMULA  by {{cite:7affa1e9-d38a-4eb7-88d2-0328dc8e05dd}}.
For FORMULA  a left cell of FORMULA  and FORMULA  a field, put
FORMULA 
Since the coefficients of the structure constants
FORMULA  are nonnegative for FORMULA 
by the calculation of du Cloux {{cite:b8e593e3-6e2d-4889-8f4b-f5a2517b99b6}}, a
result of Lusztig ({{cite:c1498bc2-4e91-4cdb-9c5f-b40b63266893}})
shows that
FORMULA 
is semisimple.
Thus FORMULA  is semisimple.
A CAS program was used to compute the dimension of
the derived algebra
FORMULA 
This dimension is 0 unless FORMULA , and is
3, 6, and 12 if
FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA ,
respectively. Another CAS program has
verified that the number of central idempotents
in FORMULA  is 11, 12, and 12 if
FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA ,
respectively.
From these observations and the structure
of the modules FORMULA 
given in {{cite:b06ac8f9-f8a2-4786-9280-fab3e65da1cd}}, the following holds.
Theorem 7.1 Let FORMULA  be a left cell of FORMULA .
Then FORMULA 
is spit semisimple over FORMULA , and is isomorphic
to the endomorphism algebra of the FORMULA -module
FORMULA .

Databases containing the
structure constants for FORMULA 
for all left cells FORMULA  and the
Kazhdan-Luztig polynomials are available
