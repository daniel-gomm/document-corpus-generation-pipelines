We report our search for optically thick radio cores in sixteen
narrow-waist bipolar nebulae. Optically thick cores are a
characteristic signature of collimated ionized winds. Eleven
northern nebulae were observed with the Very Large Array (VLA) at
1.3 cm and 0.7 cm, and five southern nebulae were observed with the
Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 6 cm and 3.6 cm. Two
northern objects, 19W32 and M 1-91, and three southern objects,
He 2-25, He 2-84 and Mz 3, were found to exhibit a compact radio
core with a rising spectrum consistent with an ionized jet. Such
jets have been seen in M 2-9 and may be responsible for shaping
bipolar structure in planetary nebulae.

Introduction
Planetary nebulae (PNs) show a remarkably broad range of often
intricate morphologies. Butterfly nebulae, classified as bipolar
nebulae with a narrow pinched waist at the center {{cite:5e87f5fc-4f25-4474-a751-2dfbed0d2b91}},
are probably the most spectacular, and yet at the same time most
puzzling. Under the classical interacting stellar winds (ISW) model
{{cite:4af1c16c-f634-45af-9f0c-fa512c4ef8fd}}, a PN is formed when the fast ionized wind from its
central star overtakes the material ejected earlier by the slow
neutral wind and compresses the material into a dense shell. This
produces a round PN if both winds are isotropic. A dense equatorial
torus, which blocks the fast wind in that direction, is added to the
interacting winds system to explain how asymmetric structure in PNs
(e.g., bipolar) can be developed {{cite:4e3c0053-b863-43b0-b941-1e9c30aed03e}}, {{cite:c20b1542-243c-49e8-91b0-15b787bb3e92}}. This,
however, can only produce bipolar nebulae with wide waists, not
those with narrow “pinched” waists. It has been suggested that
the creation of the latter nebulae requires a collimated fast wind
{{cite:b76839fe-da42-414a-bf02-5484cb23fe06}}. {{cite:b76839fe-da42-414a-bf02-5484cb23fe06}}'s model invokes a
binary star system to produce a collimated fast wind. The system
consists of a mass-losing AGB star and a main-sequence or white
dwarf companion. The AGB wind captured by the companion forms an
accretion disk around the companion that loads and drives a
collimated fast ionized wind.
The existence of collimated outflows (COFs) has been suggested by
numerous observations, usually from the ionized gas images. For
example, the highly collimated lobes of some PNs and PPNs
(proto-planetary nebulae) imply that their morphology is shaped by a
collimated outflow {{cite:9eb9eabe-bae5-4a00-b955-c874c5e89669}}. The first discovery of strongly collimated
high-velocity bipolar outflows in a PN was by {{cite:7067dcd3-a1e5-4f2e-b4cc-d24a3bae327b}}, in
NGC 2392, the Eskimo nebula. They analyzed from spectroscopic
observations of this nebula, particularly in the [N II] FORMULA 6583 emission line, they found a set of bipolar jets
with a expansion velocity of FORMULA  200 km sFORMULA  and a small
angle of collimation less than 10FORMULA . Although unexpected at
first, the pervasiveness of COFs in PNs is now widely recognized.
COFs have diverse characteristics. They are prominent in emission
lines such as [N II] and [S II] and
are observed as bipolar, multipolar, point-symmetric and jet-like
outflows. The expansion velocities of these COFs range from several
tens to a thousand km sFORMULA  {{cite:d265baf0-6da9-4e87-b225-bf343631e128}}, {{cite:03da2098-7991-4f5e-a5e3-8ecce1ad7408}}.
In addition to ionized gas, COFs have also been seen in neutral gas.
Several authors have made detailed studies on CO emission lines of
individual PNs and PPNs {{cite:8269d1d1-5013-41e5-80bf-ed7f7a47292f}}, {{cite:5b60cb2e-82de-4c8c-bb01-d56834f5d7bd}}.
The velocities for these CO outflows are found to be much smaller
than those of the ionized COFs. {{cite:745b182b-bda7-4e7b-93cf-edea4ac01421}} studied the CO
emission from a large sample of PPNs as well as two yellow
hypergiants and one young PN. They reported collimated fast
outflows in 28 of 32 objects, indicating that such outflows are a
common phenomenon in the early PN stage.
In the model proposed by {{cite:b76839fe-da42-414a-bf02-5484cb23fe06}}, the collimated winds
responsible for shaping butterfly nebulae are formed and collimated
close to the central star system. They are difficult to observe in
optical wavelengths directly, because dust around the equator limits
the depth into the center that optical observations can probe. The
dust is optically thin to radio emission, which can therefore probe
deep into the center to look for central jets, if the jets are at
least partially ionized. Using the VLA, {{cite:fe51d551-21aa-4094-a6ae-515a6f4242f7}}, {{cite:9849733d-da4d-4517-8e12-9bcc1050ebae}} have
indeed found a collimated wind in the form of a pair of ionized jet
in the core region of the narrow-waist bipolar nebula M 2-9.
M 2-9 has a bright central core and two cigar-shaped lobes extending
from opposite sides of the core FORMULA  to the north and south.
The lobes of the nebula contain three pairs of symmetric knots or
bright features: two of them are with mirror symmetry and one pair
with point/mirror symmetry. Because of its spectacular morphology,
M 2-9 is one of the most well-studied planetary nebulae. Since its
discovery in 1947, the core and the outline of the lobes have
remained stationary, but the knots and bright features have moved
laterally from the west to the east {{cite:681609e4-4548-48bc-8fd5-d3fe722c3733}}, {{cite:e6ca27c3-b6d7-4ab3-8584-2f10a887ec6e}}. Various models have been proposed to explain the
lateral motions of bright features of M 2-9. For example,
{{cite:681609e4-4548-48bc-8fd5-d3fe722c3733}} proposed that the changes were the result of a
rotating beam of ionizing radiation from the star shining through a
matched pair of holes in orbiting clouds. {{cite:e6ca27c3-b6d7-4ab3-8584-2f10a887ec6e}} noted
that it is unlikely such model can result in positional changes only
in the east-west direction, and instead suggested that the nebula
was rotating as a whole. However, since {{cite:1a47ec34-811d-4e69-985c-0fdb6ff67a37}} concluded
that the distance of M 2-9 cannot be only 50 pc as proposed by
{{cite:e6ca27c3-b6d7-4ab3-8584-2f10a887ec6e}}, the unreasonable large velocities of the knots
have made their model problematic.
Recently in explaining the structural changes of M 2-9,
{{cite:5e3fb013-c051-47d7-9e2d-7504d3299567}} and {{cite:7055fdf0-b4bc-4990-b55d-4793da9839e2}} both invoke a symbiotic star
system to produce a mirror-symmetric jet. Direct evidence of such a
jet is provided by observations of M 2-9 at 6 cm, 3.6 cm, 2 cm, and
1.3 cm by {{cite:9849733d-da4d-4517-8e12-9bcc1050ebae}}. Their observations were largely
insensitive to the large-scale free-free emission from the nebula
and focused instead on the compact radio core at the center found by
{{cite:3f5b4dd9-908d-4e75-9ca2-1ba0a8d600c1}}. Their results indicate that this optically thick
core has a spectral index of FORMULA , which is close to the
spectral index of 0.6 expected from an isothermal outflow expanding
at a constant velocity and opening angle {{cite:fb71e16e-90a0-4550-86a9-4b0561f63e6a}}. More
importantly, at the shortest wavelength of 1.3 cm where the jet is
best resolved, its bipolar lobes show a mirror-symmetric structure
{{cite:9849733d-da4d-4517-8e12-9bcc1050ebae}}. Both lobes point in the directions of
mirror-symmetric brightenings in the nebular walls seen in the HST image observed just 2 years earlier {{cite:5e3fb013-c051-47d7-9e2d-7504d3299567}}. The qualitative properties of this jet are in
good agreement with those predicted by {{cite:7055fdf0-b4bc-4990-b55d-4793da9839e2}}.
Motivated by the discovery of the ionized jets in M 2-9, we launched
a search for collimated ionized winds in butterfly nebulae using the
VLA and the ATCA. We selected a total of 16 objects from Table 1 of
{{cite:b76839fe-da42-414a-bf02-5484cb23fe06}} to search for optically thick radio cores – a
characteristic signature of ionized jets. The selected objects were
classified by {{cite:b76839fe-da42-414a-bf02-5484cb23fe06}} to have either narrow waists (10
objects) or possibly narrow waists (6 objects), whose morphology
cannot be determined with absolute certainty based on the optical
images obtained by {{cite:86f486f0-f37e-4dfd-aca2-1977df49cefd}}. We are interested in finding
any central source that is optically thick at short wavelengths
where the nebular material is already optically thin. Our goal is
to identify suitable candidates for follow-up observations with
higher sensitivity and resolution to reveal the structure of the
source. We observe each nebula with two wavelengths to calculate
its spectral index, which tells us if the emission is optically
thick. In this paper, we report the results of our search for the
radio cores. The observations and data reduction are described in
Section . In Section , we
report that radio emission were detected in 9 sources, and that 5 of
those detected have optically thick radio cores. Section
 discusses the implication of the high mass loss
rates derived from the flux densities of the radio cores. Lastly, a
summary is given in Section .

Observations and Data Reduction
The survey sample comprises 11 northern objects (Declination FORMULA  for the VLA observation limits), IRAS 07131-0147, M 1-16,
NGC 2818, NGC 6302, 19W32, HB 5, NGC 6537, M 3-28, M 1-91, M 2-48,
and NGC 7026, observed with the VLA at 1.3 cm and 0.7 cm, and 5
southern objects, He 2-25, He 2-36, He 2-84, Th 2-B, and Mz 3,
observed with the ATCA at 6 cm and 3.6 cm. The observing
wavelengths are the shortest wavelengths feasible at the time of
observations, which give the highest angular resolutions possible.
The optical properties of the objects are listed in Table
, with columns 1 and 2 giving the common name
and the PN G name based on galactic coordinates, columns 3 and 4
giving Right Ascension and Declination, column 5 indicating if they
appear to have a very narrow waist, column 6 stating if the PN has a
compact central source visible in optical images, and columns 7
indicating if the nebula shows point or mirror symmetric structure.
These properties are mainly from {{cite:b76839fe-da42-414a-bf02-5484cb23fe06}}, with some update
obtained from recent optical images. A question mark means the
attribute cannot be determined from available images.
VLA Observations
The 11 northern objects were observed at 1.3 cm and 0.7 cm with the
A-configuration in 2002 March 10. The A-configuration is the most
extended configuration, hence it provide the highest angular
resolution achieved with the VLA. It allows us to not just look for
but resolve if possible a central compact and optically think
source, as well as to better discriminate against if not resolve out
extended nebular emission. The observations were conducted in
fast-switching mode with a calibration cycle time of just 2-3
minutes in order to correct for rapid phase variation at such short
wavelengths. The integration time for the individual sources is
about 20 minutes each at 1.3 cm and 0.7 cm. 3C286 was observed for
about 5 minutes in order to calibrate the flux scales for individual
sources. The data were reduced and analyzed using the package AIPS
following the standard procedures for reducing high-frequency data
outlined in Appendix D of the AIPS Cookbook {{cite:86719568-38f5-4db0-8b68-fbf4b55d3240}}. The
calibrated data were then Fourier transformed, weighted and CLEANed
to generate the final CLEAN images. Natural weighting was applied
in order to obtain images with minimum-noise levels. We achieved an
angular resolution of FORMULA  at 1.3 cm and FORMULA  at
0.7 cm for the final CLEAN maps.

ATCA Observations
The 5 southern objects were observed at 6 cm and 3.6 cm with the
6-km “6C” configuration in 2003 March 15 and 16. These two
wavelengths were the shortest wavelengths feasible when the
observations took place. With 6-km being the most extended
configuration, they provide the highest angular resolution
achievable at the time of observation. We observed each source for
15 minutes roughly every 40 minutes over a period of 12 hours in
order to optimize the uv-coverage, obtaining a total
integration time of 4-5 hours on each object. The primary
calibrator 1934-638 was observed for flux calibration. The data
were reduced using the reduction package MIRIAD following the
procedures outlined in Miriad Users Guide {{cite:ee2b021a-f760-4c7a-b911-626719c1e769}}. The
final CLEAN images were obtained by performing inverse Fourier
transforms from the calibrated visibility datasets to images, and
then deconvolve the sidelobes using the CLEAN algorithm. Natural
weighting was used and we attained an angular resolution of FORMULA  at 6 cm and FORMULA  at 3.6 cm. Where applicable, the
self-calibration was performed to improve the image quality. In the
end, only He 2-84 has strong enough emission to allow phase
self-calibration.

Optical Observations
Three objects, He 2-36, He 2-84, and 19W32, which have radio
emission detected in our study but have no high resolution optical
images, were observed with the 2.3m Telescope in Siding Spring
Observatory (SSO) in 2003 May 26-30. The Imager instrument and
three narrow-band filters, HFORMULA , [N II] and
[O III] were used to take photometric images. The
center wavelength and bandwidth of each filter are listed in
Table , along with the best achieved FWHM during the
observations. These filters' bandwidths of FORMULA  10 Å allow
minimize contaminations from adjacent emission lines. The CCD has
dimensions of 1024x1024, with a focal plane scale of 0.59FORMULA /pixel
determined by the telescope optics.
The images were reduced with standard techniques using IRAF software
{{cite:b4328724-3283-4979-af39-dc458fe54658}}. The averaged bias frames and the overscan level
were subtracted from each target image, which was then trimmed to
discard the overscan region and the first and last few columns and
rows. The dark current was negligible during the observations, so
no dark current subtraction was performed. Finally, the images were
divided by the flat-field image for each filter. The exposure
frames of each object were then combined to generate the final
images in each filter, using a statistical method that removes
cosmic ray contamination.

Results and Analyses
Among the 16 objects observed, we detected radio emission in nine of
them, and five of which have a central compact source. In Table
 we list the detect limits (3FORMULA ) of our
observations, and the type of emission that were detected. A more
detailed description of the detections and the analysis for the
compact sources are given in the following subsections.
Northern Survey
Of the 11 objects observed by VLA, we found that NGC 6302, Hubble 5
and NGC 6537 only exhibit extended radio emission at 1.3 cm that
could not be properly mapped due to the lack of short baselines in
our observations. Two objects, 19W32 and M 1-91, show only a
compact central source at both 1.3 cm and 0.7 cm. No emission was
detected for the remaining six objects. This is the first time the
centers of all these nebulae have been examined at such high angular
resolutions at radio wavelengths. Note that for the six objects with
non-detection in our observations, some have been detected at 6 cm
by {{cite:298c5592-b1ac-4378-a0be-0dd5dcc3f239}} and {{cite:15290ba0-d2a4-42a9-8d14-f33525698b01}}, whose surveys are more
sensitive to the extended emission.
Here we present the images for the radio cores of 19W32 and M 1-91,
along with their optical images (Figures REF  and
REF ). Both objects exhibit a compact stellar-like
optical core. We obtained the optical images of 19W32 from SSO 2.3m
telescope observations as described above, those of M 1-91 from the
IAC (Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias) catalog
{{cite:d5003a0b-175e-4ddc-93fe-b01a5e6ed7ca}}. All images are oriented with north up and east
to the left.
19W32
The HFORMULA  and [N II] images of 19W32 show a
prominent stellar-like optical core and two lobes in opposite
directions, extending FORMULA  to the northeast and southwest.
Only the HFORMULA  image is presented in Figure REF . No
[O III] emission was detected for this nebula. The
radio continuum images only show a compact core, which coincides
with the optical stellar core.

M 1-91
The HFORMULA , [N II] and [O III]
images of M 1-91 shows an optical core and two lobes in opposite
directions, extending at least FORMULA  to the northeast and
southwest. Since the images of the three filters show similar
structures, only the HFORMULA  image is presented in
Figure REF . M 1-91's morphology is very similar to
M 2-9, except that the brightenings of the lobes being point
symmetric instead of mirror symmetric. The radio continuum images
only show a compact core, which coincides with the optical stellar
core. The 1.3 cm emission of M 1-91 shows some extended structures
that might align with the point-symmetric structures. This needs
further observations to confirm.

Spectral Indices of the Radio Cores
The spectral index, defined as the slope of the radio spectrum
FORMULA , indicates the emission
mechanisms and optical depths of the radio emission. Optically
thick free-free emission has a rising spectrum, optically thin
free-free emission has a flat spectrum (FORMULA ), and optically
thin nonthermal emission has a steeply falling spectrum. In the
case of a spherically symmetric nebula, the radio emission has a
spectral index of 0.6 (FORMULA ) for an
isothermal stellar wind with a constant expansion velocity
{{cite:ef4af000-8980-47fb-b694-f550727b2ba3}}, {{cite:be68695a-6bc7-4e18-aae4-f20a71faeeda}}. For a special case of collimated
ionized winds with constant opening angle, the radio emission also
has a spectral index of 0.6 {{cite:fb71e16e-90a0-4550-86a9-4b0561f63e6a}}.
In order to determine the properties of the radio cores of 19W32 and
M 1-91, we calculated the spectral indices of their radio emission.
To determine the flux densities of the radio cores observed in 19W32
and M 1-91, a two-dimensional Gaussian structure was fit to the
measurements by applying the AIPS tasks IMFIT to the clean map and
OMFIT to the visibility data. Because of the low S/N ratio in these
observations, neither task gives an obviously superior fit.
Therefore results from both tasks are given. The entire dataset
were used for fitting at both 1.3 and 0.7 cm. We also fit a more
restricted dataset at 0.7 cm chosen to have the same sampling range
in angular scales as at 1.3 cm to check for a greater inclusion of
any extended nebula emission in the larger synthesized beam. We
found that both procedures gave the same results within measurement
uncertainties (FORMULA ). Thus, in Table , only
the results obtained by fitting the datasets over their entire uv range are listed. The rising spectra of both 19W32 and M 1-91
suggest that their radio cores are produced by optically thick
free-free emission. Fits to the measured visibilities show that
these cores are resolved along one dimension; i.e., the minor axis
of the synthesized beam. The size of the emitting source will be
discussed further in § REF

Southern Survey
Of the five objects observed by ATCA, He 2-36 shows only extended
emission, He 2-25 and He 2-84 shows only a compact central source,
Mz 3 has both, and no emission was detected from Th 2-B.
Figures REF  to REF  present the radio and
optical images of the four objects with detections. For the three
objects with radio core detections, their optical images all show a
compact stellar-like cores. The optical images of He 2-25 were
obtained from {{cite:505b1847-5173-4a7b-80db-7bf2662f0d4c}}, those of Mz 3 from the HST
archive, and those of He 2-36 and He 2-84 from SSO 2.3m telescope
observations. As before, images are oriented with north up, east to
the left.
He 2-25
The optical images of He 2-25 display a bright central source and a
pair of very faint bipolar lobes extending toward north and south
(Figure REF ). The radio emission of this object is only
detected at 3.6 cm, which shows a central unresolved source
coinciding with the optical core.

He 2-36
The optical images of He 2-36 display a bright central source and an
equatorial torus with limb brightening arms extending clockwise from
the torus edges toward the north and south. The brightening
resembles an S-shape point symmetrical distribution. We presented
the HFORMULA  image in two different scales in order to show the
detailed structures (Figure REF ). The nebula possesses
a more moderate degree of bipolarity (lobes are less collimated)
than other butterfly nebulae observed in this work. The radio
images only show emission from the equatorial band. Although the
radio images show some interesting features, these are not relevant
to current investigation.

He 2-84
The HFORMULA  and [N II] images of He 2-84 show an
optical core with an equatorial torus. The two lobes extending at
right angles to this torus toward the northeast and southwest appear
to have a point symmetrical geometry. The HFORMULA  image is
displayed in two different scales in order to show the detailed
structures (Figure REF ). The lobes are very faint and
cannot be seen in the [O III] image. The radio
continuum images only show a central unresolved bright source, which
coincides with the optical core.

Mz 3
The optical images of Mz 3 show a bright core, two approximately
spherical bipolar lobes, and even more extensive filamentary
nebulosities on either side of the central star can be seen from its
HFORMULA  and [N II] images. Only the HFORMULA 
images is presented in Figure REF . The total size of the
nebula spans over 50FORMULA  on the sky. The radio images of Mz 3 show
emission from the central source and the two lobes, similar to the
radio images of M 2-9 {{cite:3f5b4dd9-908d-4e75-9ca2-1ba0a8d600c1}}. The radio central source and
the two lobes coincide with the optical core and the brightest
structures of the optical lobes.

Spectral Indices of the Radio Cores
He 2-25 has a compact radio core detected only at 3.6 cm. The fact
that no detection at 6 cm has already indicated that this core is
optically thick. Using the detection limit at 6 cm, a lower limit
of spectral index is estimated to be 1.25. However, a more precise
evaluation of the spectral index of He 2-25 has to wait for
observations at shorter wavelengths.
He 2-84 and Mz 3 have radio cores detected both at 3.6 cm and 6 cm,
suitable for spectral index determination. For He 2-84, we applied
the task IMFIT to the clean map and UVFIT to the visibility data to
determine the flux densities of its radio core assuming the radio
core to have a two-dimensional Gaussian structure. For Mz 3, the
flux density was obtained only for the bright compact core in the
CLEAN map. This core can be seen in Figure REF . The total
flux density was obtained by summing up the flux densities of the
CLEAN components in the radio core region, since the convolution of
the Clean components with the CLEAN beam might result in the
confusion of the core emission and nebular emission. The results
are listed in Table  with 1FORMULA  uncertainties.
Even with only clean components in the core region considered, it
seems only part of the diffuse emission is excluded. An analysis of
this is given later.
The radio core of He 2-84 has a spectral index significantly more
negative than the value of FORMULA  expected for optically thin
free-free emission. This suggests that the emission of the observed
radio core is dominated by more extended emission that is, as
expected, better resolved out at shorter than at longer wavelengths.
Therefore the extended emission makes a stronger contribution at
6 cm than at 3.6 cm, resulting in a spectral index that is even more
negative than expected for optically thin free-free emission. To
illustrate the effects of the extended emission on the flux
measurements, Figure REF  plots amplitude vs. uv-distance for He 2-84 at 6 cm and 3.6 cm. The real component of
the amplitudes have been averaged in several uv bins. The
binning size is wider at longer uv-distance in order to
increase the signal to noise ratio at longer baseline. As shown in
the figure, the amplitude decreases with increasing uv-distance which clear demonstrates that an extended component is
present.
In order to mitigate against contamination from the diffuse nebular
emission, we excluded the short baselines (FORMULA  50 kFORMULA ) that
pick up the extended nebular component. We also excluded the
longest baselines at 3.6 cm in order to provide the same angular
resolution as at 6 cm. Because of the noise increases caused by
removing uv data, the visibility and map fits did not yield
reliable results. Consequently, flux densities were derived by
summing the flux densities of the CLEAN components. The results are
listed in Table , which indeed shows that the
extended emission constitutes FORMULA  90% of the flux at 6 cm, and
FORMULA  80% of the flux at 3.6 cm for He 2-84. A similar analysis
was also performed on Mz 3, since some contamination from the
extended emission is also possible. The results listed in
Table  show that for Mz 3, the flux contributed from
the extended emission is relatively small at 6 cm, and there is
virtually no contamination at 3.6 cm.
The differences between the core flux densities and resultant
spectral indices obtained using the different uv distances
suggest that for both He 2-84 and Mz 3, the emission comes from two
sources, one compact and one diffuse. In both cases, the more
careful analysis incorporating the same uv-coverage (Table
) indicates that an optically thick radio core has
been detected. A separate ATCA investigation of the radio
properties of Mz 3 by {{cite:4d0c4805-caba-4a3b-aff6-0d9f20d227b1}} also concluded that Mz 3 has an
optically thick core.
It is worthwhile mentioning that we did find a compact radio source
both in 6 cm and 3.6 cm inside the primary beam of the Th 2-B
observation as shown in Figure REF . However, after
carefully examining the position of this source with the known
objects in the field using
SIMBADhttp://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/, we determined that
this is a background radio source not related to Th 2-B, since it is
about 3FORMULA  away from the optical postion of Th 2-B. This background
radio source has a spectral index of FORMULA , characteristic of
nonthermal radio emission. It is probably a quasar.

Discussion
The Mass Loss Rate
The VLA and ATCA radio flux densities obtained in the previous
sections can be used to estimate the mass loss rates of the nebulae,
following the procedure in {{cite:ef4af000-8980-47fb-b694-f550727b2ba3}}. {{cite:ef4af000-8980-47fb-b694-f550727b2ba3}}
gave the mass loss rate for a spherical wind with a spectral index
of 0.6 as
FORMULA 
where v is the velocity of the mass loss flow in km sFORMULA ,
FORMULA  is the flux observed at frequency FORMULA  in Jy, FORMULA  is in
Hz, D is the distance in kpc, Z is the nuclear charge,
FORMULA  is the mean atomic weight per electron, FORMULA  is the ratio
of electron density to the number density of ionized H, i.e., FORMULA , and g is the Gaunt factor, which can be approximated
in the radio regime as
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the electron temperature {{cite:2aaad7d0-dd2d-42dc-bda8-ac74679b3b52}}.
The constants FORMULA  and FORMULA  can be found by assuming the He to H
number ratio y and the fraction of He that is singly ionized
FORMULA , since the contributions from heavy elements are negligible due
to their low abundance. The singly ionized He to H ratio is FORMULA 
and the doubly ionized He to H ratio is FORMULA  if there is no
neutral He. The ratio of electron density to the number density of
ionized H becomes FORMULA , and the mean atomic weight
per electron is
FORMULA 
For FORMULA  and FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  have values of 1.165
and 1.236, respectively.
Assuming FORMULA  K {{cite:4dc5e36c-23a7-448e-9c90-f2de8edcd41a}} and FORMULA ,
we calculate the mass loss rate as a function of distance and wind
velocity using the flux densities found in our observations. Due to
the large uncertainties of the mass loss rate parameters, the
differences from the flux densities at different wavelengths for the
same object are nebligible. Therefore we give a best estimate of
the mass loss rate for each object in Table .
To calculate the actual mass loss rates, the wind velocities and the
distances to the nebulae are needed. Assuming a typical wind
velocity of 1000 km sFORMULA , and using the distances available from
the literature as given in Table , we obtain FORMULA  for He 2-25,
FORMULA  for He 2-84,
FORMULA  for 19W32,
FORMULA  for M 1-91
and FORMULA  for
Mz 3, respectively. The mass loss rate for Mz 3 is consistent with
that derived by {{cite:4d0c4805-caba-4a3b-aff6-0d9f20d227b1}}. They found FORMULA  using the range of FORMULA 
available in the literature.
We also used the Eq. (11) in {{cite:ef4af000-8980-47fb-b694-f550727b2ba3}} to calculate the size
of the emitting source, under the spherical wind assumption. The
size equation, when incorporated Eq. (REF ), reduced to
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  corresponds to the radius of the emitting region where the
optical depth FORMULA . For the unresolved sources,
Eq. (REF ) predicts a source size smaller than the
synthesized beam. For the two resolved sources 19W32 and M 1-91, we
listed the measured dimensions along the resolved axis and the
predicted source sizes in Table . The predicted
sizes are about 4 or 5 times smaller than the measured dimensions.
It is possible that we underestimated the predicted size by giving
the wrong assumption of temperature in Eq. (REF ).
However, to make the predicted size consistent with the measured
dimension, the temperature has to be unrealistically small (FORMULA 
200 K), in which case the winds are not ionized. Therefore, we
concluded that the predicted sizes are smaller is because these
sources are elongated, possibly by collimated winds (jets).
If we approximate a collimated source as an ellipse with major and
minor axes of FORMULA  and FORMULA , and the collimated wind has an emission
area as the same as a spherical wind, then
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the opening angle of the jet in radians.
Using the measured dimension of the resolved axis as FORMULA , we can
derive the opening angle of the collimated jet for 19W32 and M 1-91
as listed in Table . The opening angle can then be
used to revise the mass loss rate. As pointed out by
{{cite:fb71e16e-90a0-4550-86a9-4b0561f63e6a}}, a collimated wind with a much lower mass loss
rate can easily produce the same radio intensity as an uncollimated
wind with a much higher mass loss rate, with the relationship for a
spectral index of 0.6 is
FORMULA 
where i is the inclination of the major axis of the wind to
our line of sight. Assuming FORMULA , which gives a lower
limit of the ratio, we derived the ratio is FORMULA  in both
cases. Thus we revised the mass loss rates of 19W32 and M 1-91 to
FORMULA  for collimated winds,
which are about 50 times lower than assuming spherical symmetry.
From the analysis of central-star wind P-Cygni profiles observed
with the International Ultraviolet Explorer, the mass loss
rates from central stars of PNs are FORMULA  MFORMULA 
yrFORMULA  {{cite:2fd09602-d8cd-4adc-a702-fcc2a3120f5e}}. These values are consistent with
theoretical values expected from winds driven by radiation pressure
on ionized gas {{cite:a5698ad9-d980-4c55-a7c6-40825f679508}}. The mass loss rates we inferred are
at least an order of magnitude higher than expected. Such high mass
loss rates can be explained if the central stars of these nebulae
are symbiotic stars, as in the case suspected for M 2-9 whose
inferred mass loss rate is FORMULA  {{cite:9849733d-da4d-4517-8e12-9bcc1050ebae}}. Similarly, {{cite:4d0c4805-caba-4a3b-aff6-0d9f20d227b1}} also
favored a binary companion scenario instead of the superwind of a
single progenitor to explain the observational properties of Mz 3.

PNs or Symbiotic Stars?
Symbiotic stars are interacting binary systems, typically consisting
of a white dwarf that accretes material from the wind of a cool red
giant companion, sometimes forming a disk around the white dwarf.
The radiation from the hot star partially ionizes the wind from the
cool star. A spectrum of the two together thus shows a combination
of absorption lines from the surface of the cool red giant and
emission lines from the nebula. First noticed by {{cite:89f0ee82-3ba4-4ced-8e2c-ed8c1e502a42}},
{{cite:e00bf2aa-e2c9-4f77-a8d2-6ed3b14bab12}}, and {{cite:174750cf-5b48-457a-a4be-21e286cc5214}} as stars with combination of
spectra, these objects were named symbiotic stars by
{{cite:4be57db5-40a0-4cbe-9699-22aeec698035}}.
The possibility of some well-known PNs can in fact be symbiotic
stars was discussed by {{cite:284769a5-2158-4c50-b43d-083cdce0a486}} and {{cite:cdf4ac17-6d39-4714-8717-6a42dec971aa}}. With
the discovery of increasing number of PNs with binary nuclei, the
simplistic notion that PNs have single central stars and symbiotics
are binaries is no longer viable. It is often difficult to
distinguish the two classes of objects by morphology, spectrum, or
spectral energy distribution. Only in cases where periodic
photometric variability as a result of pulsation, or the
observations of photospheric molecular absorption band in the
spectrum, that one can be certain that we are dealing with a
symbiotic system. However, it is difficult to rule out that certain
PNs, including those under study here, are NOT symbiotic stars.
Even the evolutionary status of extremely well-studied objects such
as M 2-9 is still not certain.
If these nebulae with radio cores are indeed symbiotic star systems,
the ionized wind we measured would originate from the white dwarf
companion. The mass loss rate of this wind does not directly tell
the mass loss rate of the AGB star, but they must be related since
the accretion disk is material captured from the AGB star wind. If
there is a balance between accretion onto the disk and ejection to
form a jet, then the mass loss rate of the AGB star must be at least
as high as the mass loss rate of the jet. Assuming a spherically
symmetric outflow and only a fraction of the slow neutral wind from
the AGB star is captured by the WD dwarf, the corresponding mass
loss rate of the AGB star would be at least in excess of FORMULA 
MFORMULA  yrFORMULA . Such values are seldom observed in AGB stars.
This problem can be overcome if the AGB star wind is strongly
concentrated in the binary orbital plane, as is predicted for
symbiotic star systems with relatively small orbital separations.
The remaining objects have no detected radio core emission because
they are either too distant or too faint. None of those with known
distances (0.5 - 7 kpc) are farther than the most distant PN with a
detected radio core (M 1-91, 7 kpc). If all these objects have the
same radio luminosity, we should be able to detect all of them.
Therefore the more likely explanation is that these objects have
intrinsically faint radio emission. It is possible that those
objects evolved from single stars thus do not produce strong radio
emission. Since the mass loss rate from the central stars of PNs
are at least an order of magnitude smaller than that of the
symbiotic systems, even if these nebulae do have ionized jets from
the central stars, their radio emission would be too faint to be
detected. Thus radio observations may provide a way to separate
symbiotic nebulae from genuine planetary nebulae. This would also
mean that there is more than one mechanism to give a nebula a
narrow-waist shape. For single stars, one of the more possible
mechanisms for shaping nebulae is magnetic fields
{{cite:99c5b192-8ef4-4f9e-bf5c-2114c2aa41cb}}.

Summary
We have used the VLA and ATCA to search for signatures of ionized
winds – optically thick radio cores – in sixteen narrow-waist
bipolar nebulae. Eleven nebulae were observed with the VLA at
1.3 cm and 0.7 cm with resolutions of 0.08FORMULA  and 0.04FORMULA ,
respectively. This is the first time that the centers of these
objects have been systematically studied at such high angular
resolution at radio wavelengths. Two objects, 19W32 and M 1-91,
were found to exhibit a compact central source with a positive
spectral index. Three more objects examined with the VLA, NGC 6302,
Hubble 5, and NGC 6537, exhibit extended radio emission that cannot
be mapped properly at such short wavelengths. No emission was
detected for six other objects in the VLA survey.
Five nebulae were observed with the ATCA at 6 cm and 3.6 cm with
resolutions of 3FORMULA  and 1.5FORMULA , respectively. He 2-25 was found
to have a compact central source only at 3.6 cm. He 2-84 and Mz 3
were found to contain a compact central source at both wavelengths.
When short baselines that are sensitive to extended nebular emission
were excluded, we found that the spectral index of these two radio
cores changes with uv-coverage, suggesting that an optically
thick core has been detected. In addition to its compact radio
core, Mz 3 also exhibits extended nebulae emission that coincides
with the two lobes seen in the HST optical images. He 2-36
also shows extended nebular emission but no compact core. No radio
emission was detected for Th 2-B in the ATCA study.
For 19W32 and M 1-91, we found that the predicted source sizes are
smaller than the measured dimensions, which we attribute to the
radio cores being elongated, implying a collimated wind or jet. The
possibility that these radio cores represent COFs responsible for
shaping the bipolar morphology of the nebulae is particularly
intriguing. The derived mass loss rates of the wind from the radio
observations are high in comparison to typical fast winds from
central stars of planetary nebulae, and one possible solution is
that the winds are not spherical symmetric but instead are
collimated. If these winds are collimated by a binary system, then
the radio imaging offers the best way to test such models. The five
objects with radio core detections all exhibit a compact
stellar-like optical core. This needs further investigation in
order to understand the connection between the optical morphology
and the radio ionized jets.
We are planning follow-up observations of these radio cores with
higher angular resolution in order to study the structures of the
cores. We have recently obtained observations of M 1-91 with the
VLA A+PT (Pie Town) configuration. The addition of the Pie Town
antenna will increase the resolution of the VLA by a factor of two
while keeping the full sensitivity of the VLA. The new data will
add to our knowledge of the core properties of M 1-91 once the
analysis is completed.
