We study the spin-orbit splitting (FORMULA -splitting) for the proton FORMULA -orbits
in FORMULA F in the Hartree-Fock framework with the tensor force
in the exchange channel.
FORMULA F has one more proton around the neutron-rich nucleus FORMULA O. A
recent experiment indicates that the FORMULA -splitting for the proton FORMULA -orbits in FORMULA F is
reduced
from that in FORMULA F. Our calculation
shows that the FORMULA -splitting in FORMULA F becomes smaller by about a
few MeV
due to the tensor force. This
effect comes from the interaction between the valence proton and the
occupied neutrons in the FORMULA  orbit through the tensor force
and makes
the FORMULA -splitting in FORMULA F close to the experimental data.

Introduction
The spin-orbit splitting (FORMULA -splitting) is important for the structure of
nuclei. A large FORMULA -splitting between single-particle orbits with
the same orbital angular momentum is responsible for the shell
structure of nuclei {{cite:8c559f25-3b00-41fb-b098-ed2a2f2bc2de}}. Recently we have been obtaining much
information about unstable nuclei from various experiments. There are
experimental evidences, which indicate that the shell structure in
neutron-rich nuclei changes from that in stable nuclei. To confirm
the change of the shell structure, the information about
single-particle orbits around closed-shell or sub-closed-shell
nuclei is important. Michimasa and his collaborators studied the
proton single-particle orbits in FORMULA F experimentally through the
proton transfer reaction {{cite:bc41123d-586d-482f-aad7-2f5dbbc059cc}}. FORMULA F has one more
proton
around FORMULA O. They reported that the FORMULA -splitting for the
proton FORMULA -orbits (FORMULA -FORMULA ) is 4.06MeV, while the FORMULA -splitting
for the proton FORMULA -orbits in FORMULA F is 5.00MeV {{cite:89007331-c76a-4294-9237-df7455c980cc}}, {{cite:e7b44b3a-7c4e-4cd3-b811-7c2515c96d60}},
which is similar to the neutron FORMULA -orbits in FORMULA O (5.08MeV) {{cite:89007331-c76a-4294-9237-df7455c980cc}}, {{cite:e7b44b3a-7c4e-4cd3-b811-7c2515c96d60}} due to the isospin symmetry.
It indicates that there is a possibility that the FORMULA -splitting is
changed by the excess neutrons around FORMULA O. The shell model
calculations reproduce the change of the FORMULA -splitting from FORMULA F
to FORMULA F nicely
{{cite:bc41123d-586d-482f-aad7-2f5dbbc059cc}}. In the shell model calculation the
FORMULA -splitting in FORMULA F (FORMULA O) is an input parameter. Hence, it is
interesting to study the FORMULA -splitting with a mean-field-type model,
where the FORMULA -splitting is obtained self-consistently.
Hartree-Fock and Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations can now be
performed in the whole mass region over the nuclear chart. Such
mean-field
calculations can reproduce binding energies and radii of
nuclei including unstable ones using effective forces with
relatively simple forms like the Skyrme or Gogny force
{{cite:9c50a273-fc53-42ec-b714-8fa1059d8173}}, {{cite:135608ad-1766-43eb-9bc0-7d8fd4d5f01d}}. In the mean field calculations the
FORMULA -splitting of single-particle orbits is produced mainly by the
LS force. The FORMULA -splitting of single-particle orbits and the magic
number for binding energies can be explained with the LS force
having the same strength in almost the whole mass region at least
near the stability line. Some studies show that the FORMULA -splitting
in neutron-rich nuclei becomes small because the diffuseness of
the neutron density becomes large and the spin-orbit potential is
weakened {{cite:276c731a-2bde-465f-bc4c-996508bb0ef0}}, {{cite:9cb25dbf-727a-427f-a9a4-f0ad43b02704}}.
The tensor force acts on the spin of nucleon directly and should
affect the FORMULA -splitting. Although the tensor force is not usually
included in the mean field calculations, some Hartree-Fock
calculations explicitly including the tensor force or the pion in
the relativistic model showed that the tensor force affects the
FORMULA -splitting in spin-unsaturated nuclei
{{cite:12403696-c909-4fca-9e99-c2bcec968a07}}, {{cite:43501609-5d04-449e-a620-6dd2e5010c2e}}, {{cite:7b854aa9-5ca8-489a-90a5-1b9c5eef73dc}}, {{cite:186ac4f6-e24e-47d7-b356-e198de13cf12}}, {{cite:2fd69b71-541c-43f3-855e-097df6354021}}, {{cite:648e5e69-0e2e-4ce9-8b41-e04af031b4a8}}, {{cite:46cc99cc-0ec1-48c9-a47b-657120f001df}}, {{cite:fd5a4149-b69f-4b00-a5ee-ae904a0b0f97}}.
Only one orbit of the spin-orbit partners is occupied in a
spin-unsaturated nucleus, while both the spin-orbit partners are
fully occupied in a spin-saturated nucleus. For example, FORMULA Ca
is a spin-unsaturated nucleus, where the neutron FORMULA  orbit is a
spin-unsaturated orbit and FORMULA Ca is a spin-saturated nucleus.
Because the total spin coming from the intrinsic spin of nucleon is
zero in a spin-saturated nucleus if the wave functions of spin-orbit partners have
the same radial forms, the tensor force does not act between the
spin-saturated core and a particle or a hole around the core. In a
spin-unsaturated nucleus, the total intrinsic spin coming from the
spin-unsaturated orbit has a finite value and the tensor force
becomes active. In fact, the sizes of the FORMULA -splitting for hole
orbits change from FORMULA Ca to FORMULA Ca and FORMULA O to FORMULA O
in the results of the Hartree-Fock calculations with the tensor force
or the pion {{cite:43501609-5d04-449e-a620-6dd2e5010c2e}}, {{cite:7b854aa9-5ca8-489a-90a5-1b9c5eef73dc}}, {{cite:186ac4f6-e24e-47d7-b356-e198de13cf12}}, {{cite:2fd69b71-541c-43f3-855e-097df6354021}}, {{cite:648e5e69-0e2e-4ce9-8b41-e04af031b4a8}}.
For the calcium isotopes, there is an experimental
evidence {{cite:2dc3443c-c272-46d3-8e7a-dcf3397e0998}} that the FORMULA -splitting becomes smaller from
FORMULA Ca to FORMULA Ca and the order of the change is comparable to
that induced by the tensor force or the pion
{{cite:7b854aa9-5ca8-489a-90a5-1b9c5eef73dc}}, {{cite:648e5e69-0e2e-4ce9-8b41-e04af031b4a8}}. It should be noted that
in the Hartee-Fock approximation the energy contribution from the tensor force or the pion from the direct channel
becomes zero and only that from the exchange channel has a finite value in closed-shell nuclei.
Otsuka and his collaborators discussed the effect of the tensor
force on single-particle energy in other mass regions. They nicely
reproduced the change of the splitting between FORMULA  and
FORMULA  in the Sb isotopes with neutron number
{{cite:ff794592-fd23-44a3-996e-1364f37ccf85}} by the monopole shift induced by the tensor force
{{cite:648e5e69-0e2e-4ce9-8b41-e04af031b4a8}}. They also suggested the effect of the tensor force
on the shell evolution in the neutron-rich FORMULA - and FORMULA -shell region
{{cite:648e5e69-0e2e-4ce9-8b41-e04af031b4a8}}, {{cite:46cc99cc-0ec1-48c9-a47b-657120f001df}}. They discussed that the neutron shell
structure changes with proton number due to the monopole interaction
between proton and neutron orbits and explained the appearance of
the magic number 16 and the disappearance of the magic number 20 in the
neutron-rich FORMULA -shell region {{cite:648e5e69-0e2e-4ce9-8b41-e04af031b4a8}}, {{cite:57f6cdc2-8bbd-4904-92a2-ad399b428304}}, {{cite:5a7b72d2-35ff-4949-a68d-8f9dbac1f089}}.
They claimed that the monopole interaction is caused by the tensor
force {{cite:648e5e69-0e2e-4ce9-8b41-e04af031b4a8}}, {{cite:46cc99cc-0ec1-48c9-a47b-657120f001df}}. To confirm such a discussion, the
direct information about a single-particle state is essential.
In this paper we perform the Hartree-Fock calculation for FORMULA O
and FORMULA F.
We include the tensor force and study its effect on the FORMULA -splitting.
We also calculate FORMULA O to see the effect of valence
neutrons on the FORMULA -splitting and its relation to the tensor force
by comparing with FORMULA O and FORMULA F.
The formulation is given in
Section  and the results are given in
Section . Section  is devoted to
the summary of the paper.

Formulation
In the preset paper we adopt two types of Hamiltonian. One includes
the 3-body force in addition to the kinetic term and the two-body
force. The other includes the density-dependent force instead of the
3-body force. The Hamiltonian with the 3-body force FORMULA 
and that with the density dependent force FORMULA  have the
following forms,

H3B=i=1A pi22 M +
i<jA v(ri,rj) +i<j<kA
v(3)(ri,rj,rk)-ECM
,
HDD=i=1A pi22 M +
i<jA v(ri,rj) +i<jA v(DD)(;
ri,rj)-ECM.

In the above expression, FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA  are the momentum,
coordinate including spin and isospin, and mass of nucleon
respectively. FORMULA  is a mass number. FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the 2-body
and 3-body potentials respectively. FORMULA  is the
density-dependent potential with the one-body density FORMULA . We
subtract the energy of the center of mass motion
FORMULA .
In the Hartree-Fock calculation we assume the wave function of the
nucleus has the following form,

= A  (r)

with the antisymmetrization operator FORMULA  for nucleon
coordinates. FORMULA  labels each single-particle state and runs
over all occupied state. With the wave function the total energies
become

E3B=|
p22M|+
< | v
| +
<< | v(3) | 
for FORMULA  and

EDD=|
p22M|+
< | v
| + <
| v(DD)()
| 
for FORMULA , where the tildes represent the antisymmetrization.
In the above equations, FORMULA  is dropped for simplicity. By
taking a variation of the total energy with respect to a
single-particle wave function FORMULA , we obtain the
Hartree-Fock equation for each case:

p22 M (x) + dy (y)
v(x,y) [ (y) (x) - (y)
(x) ]
+12, dy dz 
(y) (z)
v(3)(x,y,z) [
{ (y) (z) - (y)
(z) } (x)
+ {(y) (z) - (y)
(z) }(x)
+ { (y) (z)- (y)
(z) }(x)]
=(x)

for the three-body force case and

p22 M (x) + dy (y)
v(x,y) [ (y) (x) - (y)
(x) ]
+dy (y)
v(DD)(;x,y) [ (y) (x) -
(y) (x)]
+< dy dz (y)
(z)
 v(DD)(;y,z)   (x) [ (y) 
(z) - (y) (z) ]
=(x)

for the density-dependent force case. In the above expression the
integrations over FORMULA  and FORMULA  include the summation over the spin and
isospin index.
In the present study we assume each single-particle state as an
eigenfunction of total spin
FORMULA . With the assumption
a single-particle wave function can be expressed as

(r) = R (r) Yljm () (),

where FORMULA  is a radial wave function, FORMULA  is an
eigenfunction of FORMULA , and FORMULA  is an isospin wave
function. FORMULA  stands for node FORMULA , total spin
FORMULA , its projection on the FORMULA  axis FORMULA , and isospin
FORMULA . We do not assume the degeneracy for the orbits with the
same FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA  because the spherical
symmetry of a mean field is broken in odd nuclei. It means that the
states with the same FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA  but different FORMULA 's are
allowed to have different radial wave functions. In such a case we
need to perform an angular momentum projection to obtain a wave
function with a good angular momentum. The expectation value for the
total angular momentum FORMULA  with the wave function obtained in the
Hartree-Fock calculation for a one-particle or one-hole state does not
deviate from FORMULA  largely (less than 1%), where FORMULA 
is the total spin of the particle or hole orbit. It indicates the
obtained wave function is almost an eigenstate of angular momentum.
Hence, we do not perform the angular momentum projection.
We approximate the density in a density-dependent force as

(r) 14R(r) R(r)

for calculational convenience. This expression is exact for a closed-shell nucleus with the
spherical symmetry and should be a good approximation for
a one-particle or one-hole nucleus with almost a spherical core.
We expand a radial wave function FORMULA  by Gaussian functions
with widths of a geometric series {{cite:3ea0bc06-286f-472b-a401-816b5545f47f}}. We take 11 Gaussian
functions with the minimum width 0.5fm and the maximum width 7fm for
each single-particle state. The Hartree-Fock equation is solved by
the gradient or damped-gradient method {{cite:c81a885a-327d-42d7-af10-e20459e4719a}}.

Result
In this section we apply the Hartree-Fock method to
FORMULA O and FORMULA F. We assume FORMULA O as a closed-shell
nucleus up to the FORMULA -shell and FORMULA O as a sub-closed-shell
nucleus where the neutron FORMULA  orbit is fully occupied in
addition to the occupied orbits in FORMULA O. For FORMULA O there is
the experimental evidence which suggests it has the sub-closed-shell
structure of the neutron FORMULA  orbit {{cite:26c91cf9-09da-428d-a72b-45e06271bb07}}. In the FORMULA O case, one neutron is
subtracted from the neutron FORMULA  orbit or the neutron
FORMULA  orbit in FORMULA O. In the FORMULA O case we add one
neutron in the FORMULA  orbit around FORMULA O. We do not put a
neutron in the FORMULA  orbit in FORMULA O because there are no
bound states in this configuration. In the FORMULA F case we add a proton
in the FORMULA  or FORMULA  orbit around FORMULA O.
As for the effective interaction, we adopt the modified Volkov force
No. 1 (MV1){{cite:7eb8aa82-1c87-417b-bc7f-0baf88601384}} for the central part and the G3RS force
{{cite:a7da6061-3376-4c9d-9348-bdd0299fdd3f}} for the tensor part. We also include the Coulomb
force. The G3RS force is determined
to reproduce the nucleon-nucleon scattering data and, therefore, the
tensor
force in the G3RS force is the one in the free space. For the strength of the
tensor force in the nuclear medium we do not have a definite
guideline at present. The
effective interaction obtained from the FORMULA -matrix theory has a
tensor part with a strength comparable to the tensor force in the free
space {{cite:964094ba-7bd2-4359-b02c-c94ffc197626}}, {{cite:e26dcf54-f9b3-4ac0-990d-43021a089c3f}}, {{cite:1d488f30-1003-4e4a-812d-3ee810385129}}, {{cite:648e5e69-0e2e-4ce9-8b41-e04af031b4a8}} at least in the region
where the relative distance is greater than about 0.8fm. We use the
tensor force in the free space in the present calculation but we need a further investigation to determine the
strength of the tensor force to be used in a mean field calculation.
It should be noted that the difference in the short range (FORMULA fm)
does not influence the tensor force matrix elements significantly
{{cite:1d488f30-1003-4e4a-812d-3ee810385129}}. As
for the LS force we take the FORMULA -type LS force
{{cite:9c50a273-fc53-42ec-b714-8fa1059d8173}}, {{cite:135608ad-1766-43eb-9bc0-7d8fd4d5f01d}}:

i W0 (1+2)k (r1-r2)
k.

The Majorana parameter in the MV1 force is fixed to 0.59, which
is determined to reproduce the binding energy of FORMULA O. FORMULA  in
the LS force is taken as 115MeVfmFORMULA , which is the same as in the
Gogny D1 force and is determined to reproduce the FORMULA -splitting
for the FORMULA  orbits in FORMULA O {{cite:135608ad-1766-43eb-9bc0-7d8fd4d5f01d}}.
TABLE 
In Table REF , the results for FORMULA O, FORMULA O, and
FORMULA O are summarized. The experimental data are also given in the
parentheses if available. The potential energy from the tensor force
becomes quite small because FORMULA O is a LS-closed-shell nucleus.
In the LS-closed-shell nucleus both the spin-orbit partners are
completely occupied. Hence, the LS-closed-shell nucleus is a spin-saturated nucleus.
The LS-closed-shell nucleus does not have
a finite total orbital angular momentum
and a finite total spin angular momentum. The tensor force
consists of the rank 2 tensors of the orbital and spin angular
momenta. Thus, the tensor force does not work between the
LS-closed-shell nucleus and a particle or a hole around it, because a
particle or hole has a spin angular momentum 1/2. In the last row
the energy differences between FORMULA O (FORMULA ) and
FORMULA O (FORMULA ) are shown. It corresponds to
the FORMULA -splitting for the FORMULA  orbits. It is about 10% smaller than
the experimental value. The contribution from the LS force is 5.8MeV
and is almost the same as the total FORMULA -splitting. It indicates
that the FORMULA -splitting is mainly produced by the LS force. The
large contribution from the kinetic energy is almost canceled out with
the contributions from the central and three-body forces. In
FORMULA O the effect of the tensor force on the FORMULA -splitting is
negligible.
TABLE 
In Table REF  the results for FORMULA O and FORMULA F are
summarized. Although the binding energy of FORMULA F (FORMULA )
(the ground state) is about 5MeV smaller than the experimental value,
it probably does not affect our discussion on the FORMULA -splitting. In
FORMULA O the neutron FORMULA  orbit around the
FORMULA O core is fully occupied. Because the spin-orbit partner, the
neutron FORMULA  orbit, is empty, FORMULA O is a spin-unsaturated
nucleus. Hence, FORMULA O has a finite total orbital angular momentum
and a finite total spin angular momentum, and the expectation value for the
tensor potential energy in FORMULA F becomes finite. In FORMULA O, the energy
contributions from the LS force and the tensor force are FORMULA MeV and
1.9MeV respectively. In FORMULA F a proton is added to FORMULA O. If
the proton is put in the FORMULA  orbit the absolute value of the
LS potential energy
becomes small by 4.5MeV and if the proton is put in the FORMULA 
orbit that of the LS potential energy becomes large by 3.3MeV. In
contrast,
the tensor potential energy becomes small by 1.8MeV when the proton
is in the FORMULA  orbit and becomes large by 1.3MeV when the
proton is in the FORMULA  orbit. As a result, the contribution to
the FORMULA -splitting for the proton FORMULA  orbits in FORMULA F from the
LS force is 7.8MeV and that from the tensor force is FORMULA MeV. The
sum of them is 4.5MeV. The relatively small FORMULA -splitting 4.2MeV
after adding the contributions from the kinetic and other potential energies,
which is close to the experimental value, is realized by the
cancelation between the contributions from the LS force and the tensor force.
TABLE 
The energy differences between one-particle states and their
corresponding
cores are shown in Table REF . The LS potential energies
from the cores for the FORMULA  orbit are FORMULA MeV in FORMULA O and
FORMULA MeV in FORMULA F.
The LS potential energy for the FORMULA  orbit in FORMULA F is
smaller as expected from that for the FORMULA  orbit
(FORMULA MeV). It is probably due to a weak
binding of the
FORMULA  orbit compared to the FORMULA  one. The contribution
from the tensor force to the splitting for the FORMULA  orbits in FORMULA F
is about a half
of that from the LS force with the opposite sign as discussed in the
previous section. The results for FORMULA O and FORMULA F in
Table REF  indicate that the contribution to the
FORMULA -splitting from the LS force mainly comes from the FORMULA O core
and that from the tensor force comes from the excess neutron orbit
(the neutron FORMULA  orbit).
TABLE 
In Table REF , the contributions to the tensor potential
energy from the triplet-even and triplet-odd parts are shown
separately. In
FORMULA O the tensor potential energy mainly comes from the
triplet-odd part. It is natural because only the neutron FORMULA 
orbit is occupied and there are no valence protons around the
FORMULA O core. In FORMULA F the contribution from the triplet-even
part is comparable to that from the triplet-odd part for the
FORMULA  orbit and they have the opposite sign.
For the FORMULA  orbit the contribution from the triplet-even
part is smaller than that from the triplet-odd
part and they have the same sign. To see the effect of the tensor force
on the valence proton, the energy differences between FORMULA F and
FORMULA O are shown in the table. The differences are dominated by
the triplet-even part. It means that the contribution to the
FORMULA -splitting from the tensor force mainly comes from the
triplet-even tensor force.
TABLE 
Finally we compare the FORMULA -splitting calculated with other
effective interactions with our result discussed above (MV1) in
Table REF . We also show the result without the tensor
force (MV1 without FORMULA ). The Gogny D1S
force {{cite:16a82f8b-0a48-4f17-ba12-59419002b979}} does not have a tensor part and a stronger LS
part (FORMULA =130MeVfmFORMULA ) than one we adopted above. The M3Y-P2
force {{cite:8e17de76-2bae-4b9b-ad14-443787a75d1e}} has a weak tensor part and an LS part
comparable to the Gogny D1S force. The GT2 {{cite:46cc99cc-0ec1-48c9-a47b-657120f001df}}, {{cite:d686c13a-ae75-4bec-ac37-da1af4d8b178}}
force has a tensor part comparable to that in the free space and a
strong LS part (FORMULA =160MeVfmFORMULA ). While the rather schematic
form of the tensor force is adopted in Ref. otsuka06,
we replace the tensor part of the GT2 force with the G3RS force we
used above. The sizes
of the FORMULA -splitting for the MV1 force without the tensor force,
the Gogny force, and the M3Y-P2 force are large compared to the
experimental value. It indicates that the relatively strong tensor
force comparable to that in the free space is needed to reproduce the
FORMULA -splitting in FORMULA F. Although the GT2 force has a strong
tensor part, it gives quite large splitting. It is due to the
strong LS part of the GT2 force. The contribution from the LS force
to the FORMULA -splitting is much larger than those with other effective
forces. In fact, the FORMULA -splitting for the FORMULA  orbits in FORMULA O
with the GT2 force is 8.3MeV. It is much larger than the
experimental value. It indicates that the proper strength of the LS
force, which give the reasonable FORMULA -splitting in FORMULA O is
needed to reproduce the FORMULA -splitting in FORMULA F.
The tensor force also induces a 2-particle–2-hole (FORMULA )
correlation, which cannot be treated in a usual mean field
calculation. The FORMULA  correlation by the tensor force produces the
large attractive energy in nuclei {{cite:ee4a4a2f-d9b2-415c-9485-3f00502c9ed7}}, {{cite:06a73216-b310-48d1-8c62-631568efb878}}. Recently
we developed a mean field framework which can treat the FORMULA 
tensor correlation by introducing single-particle states with charge
and parity mixing {{cite:3bee9060-e341-4aff-9694-eceecd30deec}}, {{cite:6096663b-fcfb-423e-af12-2b3914c139a3}}, {{cite:33e10116-b3dc-4eee-b3d5-1a2a37d8866c}}, {{cite:28056453-8706-4ee8-975b-e596e70f485b}}. We
applied the extended mean field model to sub-closed-shell oxygen
isotopes {{cite:28056453-8706-4ee8-975b-e596e70f485b}} and found that the potential energy from
the tensor force is comparable to that from the LS force. The
importance of the FORMULA  tensor correlation for the FORMULA -splitting
is indicated in other studies {{cite:e94fd315-7f66-4814-a38e-27799a7a1eb5}}, {{cite:47b429d9-25bb-4bad-971a-a2ae8a5e47a5}}, {{cite:eef1c74a-26d2-4347-969b-05c44c2395f8}}, {{cite:6096663b-fcfb-423e-af12-2b3914c139a3}}.
It is interesting to study the effect of the FORMULA  tensor
correlation on the FORMULA -splitting with our extended mean filed model. Because our
calculation showed that the excess neutrons around FORMULA O do not
contribute to the FORMULA  tensor correlation strongly {{cite:28056453-8706-4ee8-975b-e596e70f485b}},
the Hartree-Fock calculation seems to be sufficient as the first step.

Summary
We have performed the Hartree-Fock calculation with the tensor force for
FORMULA O, FORMULA O, FORMULA O, FORMULA O, and FORMULA F to study the
effect of the tensor force on the FORMULA -splitting.
The tensor force does not affect the FORMULA -splitting for the FORMULA 
orbits in FORMULA O because FORMULA O is a LS-closed-shell nucleus.
The FORMULA -splitting is almost produced by the LS force in FORMULA O.
In FORMULA O, the neutron FORMULA  orbit is fully occupied. It
gives the finite expectation value for the tensor force in FORMULA O.
In FORMULA F a proton is added to FORMULA O. The LS force works to
provide the FORMULA -splitting for the proton FORMULA -orbits in FORMULA F by
7.8MeV. In contrast, the tensor force reduces the FORMULA -splitting by
3.1MeV. The effect of the tensor force mainly comes from the
occupied neutron FORMULA  orbit. The resulting FORMULA -splitting of
4.2MeV
close to the experimental data is realized by the cancelation
between the effects of the LS force and the tensor force. The
contribution from the tensor force to the FORMULA -splitting in FORMULA F mainly comes
from the triplet-even part of the tensor force.
We have compared the results with various effective interactions with
and without
the tensor force. The effective interaction without the tensor force
or with the weak tensor force does not explain the experimental
value for the FORMULA -splitting for the proton FORMULA -orbits in FORMULA F.
Our study indicates that the LS and tensor forces with reasonable
strengths are needed
