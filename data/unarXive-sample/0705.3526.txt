We report FORMULA Cu NQR measurements on slightly underdoped FORMULA  single
crystals heavily doped by Ni and Zn impurities. Owing to the impurity
doping superconductivity is fully suppressed in both cases. The Ni
strongly enhances magnetic correlations and induces a wipeout of the NQR
signal comparable to that found in stripe ordered lanthanum cuprates. In
contrast, the magnetism is suppressed in the Zn doped sample where no
wipeout effect is observed and the nuclear spin relaxation rate is
reduced. Our findings are in a striking correspondence with the different
impact of Ni and Zn impurities on the charge pseudogap evidenced by recent
optical data, uncovering thereby a close relationship between the magnetic
correlations and pseudogap phenomena.

Magnetic (Ni) and non-magnetic (Zn) substitution for copper in
superconducting cuprates can help to understand the still unveiled
mechanism of high temperature superconductivity (HTSC) by studying
the influence of these impurities on the electronic and magnetic
properties of the CuOFORMULA  planes. Adding a few percent of Ni or Zn
is sufficient to suppresses superconductivity in
LaFORMULA SrFORMULA CuOFORMULA  (LSCO) {{cite:f512ca13-6ec6-4699-9d77-6b6b8e8e885a}}. Ni and Zn doping
affects also the unusual normal state electronic properties of
HTSCs such as the pseudogap (PG) state {{cite:78ad15d6-00fb-46e8-bddf-5439aaf7dcae}}. In
particular, observation of the magnetic moments induced by a
nominally spinless Zn impurity in underdoped cuprates
{{cite:3c03aa56-6cf3-414a-baa2-86eb9b89dc04}}, {{cite:c50ba697-0cac-4e8d-b012-fe063730d151}}, {{cite:89fc6a21-0e58-4053-baea-981ae140873b}}, {{cite:54092f23-7488-421e-be68-4a310b40ea3d}}, {{cite:eed59b6f-77bb-439d-b1b4-6c28b20b6706}}, {{cite:ccb677e9-e43d-4eca-95e6-fca028e99e02}}, {{cite:423ded1d-4269-4925-9d40-95f420090092}}
has been one of the most spectacular manifestations of nontrivial
correlations operating in the PG state. Recently it was found
{{cite:8ae459d3-e874-4d8c-a7e0-c866b533aa82}} that higher amounts of Ni and Zn can be
incorporated in FORMULA  (NBCO), and thereby superconductivity is
fully suppressed even at optimal doping. Measurements of the
optical conductivity that probes the charge excitations
in these compounds show that Ni and Zn have a profoundly different
impact on the PG {{cite:8ae459d3-e874-4d8c-a7e0-c866b533aa82}}. Large Zn-doping suppresses the
PG, whereas Ni enhances its energy scale. Such a drastic
difference suggests that the nonmagnetic and magnetic doping may
have opposite effect on the spin dynamics and
antiferromagnetic (AF) correlations in the PG regime.
To elucidate the influence of the impurity doping on the spin
dynamics we have performed FORMULA Cu nuclear quadrupole resonance
(NQR) measurements of single crystals of Ni and Zn doped NBCO.
Since in addition to CuOFORMULA  planes responsible for HTSC the
crystal structure comprises CuO chains we have estimated the
distribution of the Ni and Zn ions between these two structural
units by analyzing the Cu NQR lineshape. The most striking result
of our study is a Ni induced wipeout of the Cu NQR signal at low
temperatures similar to that observed in stripe ordered rare earth
(RE) co-doped lanthanum cuprates
{{cite:b0036d88-bdd8-4f41-a03d-209f94d138e4}}, {{cite:cc2e7364-62e9-4f48-aea0-48d6545d869a}}, {{cite:9e03cc7a-1733-4848-adeb-8314fc077f4a}}, {{cite:4ac230c4-73b2-4145-8631-82e82c46323e}}, {{cite:f6e3a2a9-bdbb-48a5-ace6-95426dd131f4}}. The wipeout is caused by a
continuously slowing down of the Cu electronic spin fluctuations.
In contrast the Zn doping does not induce any wipeout albeit a
significantly larger concentration of the Zn in the planes
compared to Ni. Here the intensity as well as the linewidth and
shape of the spectra is unchanged down to 4.2 K. Also the spin
lattice relaxation is suppressed by the Zn in the whole
temperature range. This difference in the spin dynamics is in a
striking correspondence with the different charge dynamics
measured by optical conductivity. Doping by Ni leads to a slowing
of electronic spin fluctuations and a glassy magnetic order and
enhances the energy scale of the charge PG. On the other hand Zn
doping does not induce such a quasistatic magnetic order and
thereby a wipeout of the NQR signal, but suppresses the charge PG
and the spin lattice relaxation rate. Thus our data point out an
intimate interplay between the spin- and charge excitations in the
PG state of the cuprates and support theoretical predictions of
the different effect of magnetic and non-magnetic impurities on
the properties of the strongly correlated CuOFORMULA  planes in HTSCs.
We used high quality single crystals of NdBaFORMULA (Cu,Ni,Zn)FORMULA OFORMULA  with 11.5 FORMULA  Ni,
5 FORMULA  Zn, and 9.5 FORMULA  Zn, and a superconducting NBCO sample without
impurities as a reference. All samples are slightly underdoped with
FORMULA . For details of the sample preparation see Ref.
{{cite:8ae459d3-e874-4d8c-a7e0-c866b533aa82}}. Midpoint FORMULA  is 83 FORMULA 4 K in the pure sample and
26 FORMULA 5 K in the 5 FORMULA  Zn doped sample. Note that FORMULA  in
underdoped NBCO is lower than in underdoped FORMULA  (YBCO).
Superconductivity is completely suppressed in the samples with 11.5 FORMULA 
Ni and 9.5 FORMULA  Zn.
A tuned NMR/NQR circuit with an almost FORMULA -independent low quality factor
FORMULA  similar to that in Ref. {{cite:40574c00-710b-48d1-8f3e-80dfa2ad934d}} was used to minimize the influence
of FORMULA  on the spectrum intensity FORMULA . The intensity was
also corrected for the Boltzmann factor and for spin echo decay FORMULA 
{{cite:4ac230c4-73b2-4145-8631-82e82c46323e}}. The spin lattice relaxation time, FORMULA  was measured by
inversion recovery of the longitudinal magnetization FORMULA  which was
fitted to the expression
FORMULA  = FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA , where
FORMULA .
Fig. REF  shows FORMULA Cu NQR spectra of the chains and planes of
NBCO for different dopings at FORMULA  = 200 K.
FIGURE 
The resonance frequency FORMULA  of the planar Cu(2) in
pure NBCO is blue-shifted in comparison to YBCO by
FORMULA  1.5 MHz owing to the larger ionic radius of the Nd
compared to the Y {{cite:6a5b9b68-1c41-4ccb-9bd0-15225e3d4d92}}, but the linewidth and shape
corresponds well to that in YBCO {{cite:423ded1d-4269-4925-9d40-95f420090092}}, {{cite:e89bcf2e-48ed-46ca-b15f-9a50963401f7}}, {{cite:ade1d547-506d-48ef-aa11-39fa74a95189}}. In
contrast to the RE elements, Zn and Ni doping on the Cu site
affects FORMULA  only slightly, but changes significantly
the linewidth and shape. Thereby Ni broadens the chain signal
stronger than Zn, and Zn broadens the planar signal stronger than
Ni. This difference may occur since Ni preferably occupies the
chain Cu site in YBCO whereas Zn substitutes mainly for the Cu in
the planes {{cite:8ae459d3-e874-4d8c-a7e0-c866b533aa82}}. To estimate the impurity content in
the CuOFORMULA  planes we have fitted the spectra by three lines for
each Cu isotope using a model similar to that used by Itoh et al. {{cite:423ded1d-4269-4925-9d40-95f420090092}}. The black shaded line in Fig. REF 
corresponds to those Cu sites that are 5-th and farther nearest
neighbors to the impurity (5+NNs) {{cite:2c795bc9-0a76-4578-8d56-fcf6329d339a}}. The light grey
(online green) shaded line originates from the Cu sites that are
closer to an impurity, namely the 4NNs to 2NNs. Such a line has
also been found before in Zn doped YBCO and FORMULA  {{cite:423ded1d-4269-4925-9d40-95f420090092}}, {{cite:eed59b6f-77bb-439d-b1b4-6c28b20b6706}}, {{cite:ccb677e9-e43d-4eca-95e6-fca028e99e02}}, {{cite:3d59a0cd-27f0-4e8e-9d43-2940d6fedbfd}}, but not for the Ni doped
samples, probably due to a smaller Ni content in the planes (see
below). Finally, the dark grey (red online) shaded line
corresponds to the 1NNs Cu sites to the impurity. Such a line has
been suspected by Itoh et al. {{cite:423ded1d-4269-4925-9d40-95f420090092}}, but could not be
verified in the spectra. It has been assumed that this line as
well as the missing line in case of Ni doping {{cite:eed59b6f-77bb-439d-b1b4-6c28b20b6706}}, {{cite:ccb677e9-e43d-4eca-95e6-fca028e99e02}}
are wiped out. These lines are however not wiped out in our
spectra. We have then numerically calculated the number of
particular NN Cu sites around an impurity, and compared them with
the intensity of the respective lines of the fits. From that we
obtain FORMULA  4 % Ni and FORMULA  9.5 % Zn impurities in the
CuOFORMULA  planes. Since there are two CuOFORMULA  layers and one chain
layer in the unit cell we calculate for the chains an impurity
content of 9.5 FORMULA  Zn and 26.5 FORMULA  Ni. That the Ni prefers the
chain sites is evident from a much stronger broadening of the
chain spectrum in this case compared to the Zn doped sample.
Moreover, we compare in Fig.REF  (d) a spectrum of a
sample with 5 FORMULA  Zn with the spectrum of the Ni doped sample.
Clearly, the planar Cu(2) spectra of both samples are very similar
whereas the chain Cu(1) signal of the Zn sample is only weakly
broadened which evidences a preferential planar site occupancy by
Zn. Despite the controversial discussion about the Cu site
assignment in the CuOFORMULA  planes around a defect
{{cite:a47bf926-311a-4e3c-86d8-3df92503e453}}, {{cite:88249156-94f4-4b07-9cb7-0a7aafdddf3b}}, {{cite:16de5410-7ee4-4248-a8ff-6eb8fb098fc9}}, our data supports a model that
distinguishes different Cu sites close to an impurity by Cu NQR.
Also the frequency dependence of the relaxation rate FORMULA 
supports this model (see below).
Our most obvious observation that proves the different effect of
Zn and Ni doping on the electronic properties of the CuOFORMULA 
planes is a wipeout of the Cu NQR signal in the Ni doped sample
below FORMULA  K, whereas the Cu NQR intensity FORMULA  of the Zn doped sample is constant down to the lowest FORMULA 
{{cite:587d32ff-3e19-46db-b6b9-88e851c12fd0}}. Also FORMULA , the linewidth and shape of the
spectra of the Zn doped sample exhibit almost no FORMULA  dependence,
whereas the spectra of the Ni samples change with FORMULA , especially
in the region where the wipeout sets in. The FORMULA  dependences are shown in Fig. REF  and compared
with those obtained for an oriented powder of FORMULA  (LESCO) and a single
crystal of FORMULA 
(LBCO). The onset of wipeout in the Ni doped NBCO occurs at a
slightly lower FORMULA  and develops in a broader temperature range in
comparison to LESCO and LBCO. In lanthanum cuprates the wipeout of
the Cu signal is well known, and has been interpreted as the
stripe order parameter and as evidence for a glassy, inhomogeneous
freezing of Cu spin fluctuations
{{cite:cc2e7364-62e9-4f48-aea0-48d6545d869a}}, {{cite:9e03cc7a-1733-4848-adeb-8314fc077f4a}}, {{cite:4ac230c4-73b2-4145-8631-82e82c46323e}}, {{cite:b0036d88-bdd8-4f41-a03d-209f94d138e4}}, {{cite:f6e3a2a9-bdbb-48a5-ace6-95426dd131f4}}. However, to our knowledge a
complete wipeout of the Cu NQR intensity for an almost optimally
doped RBCO (R= RE or Y) has not been reported before
{{cite:ec2b4648-740c-44f0-aae0-9ec15d1191a2}}.
FIGURE 
In NQR the wipeout occurs when the Cu electronic spin fluctuation
frequency FORMULA  decreases with FORMULA  and approaches
FORMULA . At this point the field FORMULA  at the nuclear site
caused by the fluctuating electronic spins is most efficient in
shortening the nuclear spin relaxation rate FORMULA  so that the NQR response
relaxes before it can be measured. Here FORMULA  is the
gyromagnetic ratio. The slowing down of spin fluctuations with
decreasing FORMULA  in Ni doped NBCO is evidenced by the strong
enhancement of FORMULA  (Fig. REF ) concomitant the
wipeout. Remarkably, Zn doping has an entirely different effect:
FORMULA  is suppressed even compared to the pure NBCO at high
FORMULA  and increases only slightly in the low-FORMULA  regime. The latter
is probably related to the fluctuating Nd moments whose
susceptibility increases with decreasing FORMULA  {{cite:5048894d-20e6-44a0-bbc7-2f3b7a3bd89c}}. The
frequency dependence of FORMULA  (inset of Fig. REF )
clearly demonstrates the different effect of Ni and Zn on the spin
relaxation and supports the model of the site assignment in the
CuOFORMULA  planes: for the Zn doped sample FORMULA  decreases with
decreasing the frequency, i.e. by approaching the impurity site
(cf. Fig. REF ), whereas it tends to increase in the Ni
doped case. The magnetization decay FORMULA  is single exponential
(FORMULA ) at high temperatures for the Ni doped and
the pure NBCO. Remarkably we find FORMULA  for the Zn
doped sample, and below FORMULA 70 K for the Ni doped sample,
implying the distribution of the rates FORMULA , similar to the
Zn doped YBCO {{cite:88249156-94f4-4b07-9cb7-0a7aafdddf3b}}, {{cite:3d52f581-5844-4bb3-93d4-9dce7d226a79}}, and stripe ordered LSCO at
temperatures where the wipeout sets in {{cite:b0036d88-bdd8-4f41-a03d-209f94d138e4}}. Supporting
evidence for the different spin dynamics in Ni and Zn doped NBCO
comes from FORMULA SR measurements of this compound {{cite:8ae459d3-e874-4d8c-a7e0-c866b533aa82}}.
It reveals static magnetic moments on the time scale of FORMULA SR in
case of Ni doping but not for Zn doping. This is also a feature of
the stripe order in lanthanum cuprates {{cite:38c2d848-8a92-43e4-880c-46bc7348e613}}. In
particular, the weakening of the spin correlations by large Zn
doping was found in a FORMULA SR study of LSCO {{cite:2e845297-2309-448e-b351-87014e5f6bbf}}.
The distinction of NQR data between the Zn- and Ni-substituted
NBCO samples is remarkable. Given that a small amount of
both Zn and Ni impurities induce magnetic moments and enhance AF
correlations in cuprates
{{cite:3c03aa56-6cf3-414a-baa2-86eb9b89dc04}}, {{cite:c50ba697-0cac-4e8d-b012-fe063730d151}}, {{cite:89fc6a21-0e58-4053-baea-981ae140873b}}, {{cite:54092f23-7488-421e-be68-4a310b40ea3d}}, {{cite:eed59b6f-77bb-439d-b1b4-6c28b20b6706}}, {{cite:ccb677e9-e43d-4eca-95e6-fca028e99e02}}, {{cite:423ded1d-4269-4925-9d40-95f420090092}},
their opposite impact on low energy spin dynamics of CuOFORMULA 
planes that we observe here is highly surprising. Unexpected
suppression of AF correlations by large Zn doping – in
contrast to the Ni case – suggests that a picture of Zn induced
magnetic moments and associated enhancement of AF is no longer
applicable at large Zn-doping. The reason is that while Ni ion
introduces its own local spin FORMULA  coupled antiferromagnetically
to the neighboring Cu spins, the Zn induced magnetic moment has a
completely different microscopic origin
{{cite:7299107f-f914-41b6-890b-c9f599fa3bf3}}, {{cite:6cba8f1b-fd10-4537-bf9a-7631093c897b}}, {{cite:53d65156-8712-43e9-bf2f-8dc3ddfc3568}}. Namely, it can be viewed
as a spatially extended bound state near the Fermi energy,
originating from the many-body response of a correlated Cu-spin
background on a "missing-spin" defect. Because of their highly
nonlocal hence fragile nature, low-energy resonances induced by
different Zn ions should strongly overlap and may eventually
disappear at larger Zn-doping because of the destructive
interference. In this limit, nonmagnetic Zn impurities would
mainly act to suppress low-energy spin collective modes via the
dilution and/or disorder effects {{cite:65606d4b-6b2d-4355-af84-5a1779a39c65}} amplified at the
presence of charge carriers. Apparently, this is what we see here
as a decrease of NQR relaxation rates. On the contrary, Ni induced
moments are robust because of their local origin, and thus have a
positive impact on AF at all the doping levels {{cite:2adaa53e-2172-44d6-95ac-181d672cb0d7}}.
It seems that there is a one-to-one correspondence between our
finding that the spectral weight of low-energy magnetic
excitations in heavily Ni (Zn) doped cuprates is enhanced
(suppressed), and that of Ref. {{cite:8ae459d3-e874-4d8c-a7e0-c866b533aa82}} reporting an
increase (decrease) of the optical pseudogap by Ni (Zn) doping. A
straightforward implication of this comparison is that quasistatic
(as probed here by NQR) AF correlations are essential for the
understanding of a celebrated pseudogap phenomenon in cuprates.
Clearly, an enhancement of both PG and AF by Ni doping would be
difficult to rationalize solely in terms of binding of spins into
singlet-pairs, as this would lead to a suppression of the nuclear
spin relaxation rate in contradiction to what is observed.
Therefore, both AF correlations and pairing effects should be
considered on equal footing, which remains a challenge for theory.
One may speculate that similar to the RE doped LSCO
{{cite:1c7a43d3-4967-4207-ada4-6bc88afdaaa6}} the renormalized classical regime with a
reduced spin stiffness can be recovered in the Ni doped NBCO in
spite of a substantial concentration of holes in the planes. In
this scenario the frequency of the spin fluctuations may decrease
exponentially with decreasing temperature causing the wipeout of
the NQR signal, as found in the RE doped LSCO
{{cite:b0036d88-bdd8-4f41-a03d-209f94d138e4}}, {{cite:cc2e7364-62e9-4f48-aea0-48d6545d869a}}, {{cite:9e03cc7a-1733-4848-adeb-8314fc077f4a}} and widely discussed in connection with
the stripe physics, i.e. spatial modulations of the spin density
in the CuOFORMULA  planes. Structural distortions induced by RE
co-doping of LSCO result in the pinning of dynamic stripes and
suppression of superconductivity {{cite:1c7a43d3-4967-4207-ada4-6bc88afdaaa6}}. These
findings in RE doped LSCO are in an apparent similarity with our
data that show a strongly enhanced nuclear relaxation rate
FORMULA  (slow electron spin dynamics) in the heavily Ni doped
NBCO. One can speculate therefore on a possible relevance of the
stripe scenario to the physics of NBCO.
Regardless a particular model, our Cu NQR results on the different effect
of the Zn and Ni doping on the spin dynamics in NBCO suggest it as a
generic property of the HTSC cuprates. The slowing down of the electronic
spin fluctuations should have a direct implication on the dynamics in the
charge sector. Indeed, the recovery of the antiferromagnetism owing to the
strong interaction between the Ni impurities enhances the tendency of the
hole localization and thus inhibits the charge dynamics. For this reason
the PG energy scale is pushed up to much higher energies as compared with
the pure NBCO as it has recently been observed {{cite:8ae459d3-e874-4d8c-a7e0-c866b533aa82}}.
In summary, our Cu NQR study of the heavily Ni doped NBCO reveals
a complete wipeout of the NQR intensity concomitant with the
strong enhancement of the nuclear relaxation rate FORMULA . In a
striking contrast the Zn doping yields a reduction of FORMULA 
and does not cause a wipeout, although the impurity content of Zn
in the planes is much higher. The data enlighten an entirely
different effect of the magnetic and nonmagnetic doping on the
spin dynamics and correlations in the CuOFORMULA  planes that is in a
remarkable correspondence with the different impact of the Ni and
Zn impurities on the charge excitations probed by optical
measurements. In particular, the Cu NQR results provide strong
experimental evidence that magnetic correlations play a vital role
in the charge PG phenomenon in cuprates.
