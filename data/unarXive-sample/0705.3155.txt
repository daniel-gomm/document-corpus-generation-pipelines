A Ramsey interrogation scheme was used to measure the phase shift of laser-cooled FORMULA Rb clock-transition pseudospins arising as a result of a reversal of a bias magnetic field, i.e., FORMULA , during the interrogation. While no phase shift occurred when the reversal was sudden, the Ramsey fringes were shifted by a factor of FORMULA  when the reversal was adiabatic. We thus verified the prediction that the spin states FORMULA  acquire a purely topological and parity-dependent phase factor of FORMULA  as a result of FORMULA .

One of the most astonishing prediction of quantum mechanics is the FORMULA -phase shift of spin-1/2 particles by FORMULA  rotations {{cite:2905e52a-f8d9-47f3-a9ab-c35fd0f560c4}}. The non-trivial FORMULA -phase shift was claimed to be measurable {{cite:8ad707e4-d75d-464c-84f2-26737bda02fc}}, {{cite:9f376df5-cf13-4bb8-926c-a79838432d53}}, and later proved by the beautiful neutron interference experiments {{cite:fcf0c023-7f0b-41b3-9545-e4ef5f06a373}}, {{cite:4c2916f3-6714-45a5-ae0a-3e4a84e0ac02}}. The phase shift can be interpreted by the double-valuedness of the spinor wave function under three-dimensional rotations {{cite:d9b7f3d5-1991-4fbc-b241-3b9fa1917eae}}.
In this Letter, we report on an experiment on the non-trivial FORMULA -phase shift of a seemingly trivial integer spin. To see its curious behavior, let us consider the following situation: an atom with integer total spin, FORMULA  (here, we assume the orbital angular momentum FORMULA  for brevity), and its z-component, FORMULA , goes through a reversal of a bias magnetic field from, say, FORMULA  at time FORMULA  to FORMULA  at FORMULA . When the bias magnetic field is kept finite in the course of the reversal (i.e.,FORMULA ) and changes sufficiently slowly as to avoid energy level crossing and satisfy the adiabatic condition, each spin eigenstate remains as an instantaneous one {{cite:b27581dc-09bc-40bb-92ae-026f63575a57}}, {{cite:57552714-29ec-440a-bf00-c036230b01ae}}. Here, the peculiar thing about the FORMULA  eigenstate is that the final state at FORMULA  is exactly the same state as the initial eigenstate FORMULA  up to a certain phase factor. Then, the question is “what phase factor arises?" Quantum mechanics tells us that the phase is FORMULA  as is derived as follows: Without loss of generality, the adiabatic reversal FORMULA  with FORMULA  is equivalent to a y-axis [or x-axis] FORMULA  rotation of the FORMULA , i.e., FORMULA  [or FORMULA ], where FORMULA  are the spherical harmonics and FORMULA  [or FORMULA ] corresponds to a y-axis [or x-axis] FORMULA  rotation. Since the spherical harmonics for FORMULA , i.e., FORMULA , do not depend on FORMULA , then the y-axis [or x-axis] FORMULA  rotation is identical to the space inversion FORMULA . Thus, we have the aforesaid phase factor:
FORMULA 
from the parity of FORMULA  {{cite:2905e52a-f8d9-47f3-a9ab-c35fd0f560c4}}, {{cite:d9b7f3d5-1991-4fbc-b241-3b9fa1917eae}}.
The phase factor of FORMULA  in Eq. (REF ) is interesting in the following three points: First, the phase is neither a dynamical phase nor a conventional geometric phase {{cite:5a8649ba-a442-47d5-9fb3-2ad81cea80c9}}. The dynamical phase is 0 because the Zeeman energy, FORMULA , remains 0 for the FORMULA  eigenstate throughout the course of the bias-magnetic-field reversal, where FORMULA  is the Landé factor and FORMULA  is Bohr magneton. The conventional geometric phase is also 0 because the “magnetic field" induced by the parameter space FORMULA  {{cite:5a8649ba-a442-47d5-9fb3-2ad81cea80c9}} (in other words, Berry's curvature {{cite:67330b40-557c-4d60-b1aa-187355dd7829}}, {{cite:92fa2cba-5dc0-4e70-afca-b80456b3d24f}}) is 0 for the FORMULA  eigenstate. Robbins and Berry, in their imaginative paper {{cite:2b30f06e-120e-4e44-a037-90c017504c9d}}, gave a topological explanation for the phase factor of FORMULA . The underlying topology is elucidated by considering the parameter space FORMULA  for the FORMULA  eigenstate, in which each point determines the FORMULA  eigenstate up to a phase, as a real projective plane {{cite:92fa2cba-5dc0-4e70-afca-b80456b3d24f}}. Here, FORMULA  and the point FORMULA  can be identified with the antipodal point FORMULA . The non-trivial closed cycle on the real projective plane results in the phase factor of FORMULA  {{cite:2b30f06e-120e-4e44-a037-90c017504c9d}}. The phase, FORMULA , is the key to a novel non-relativistic account of the spin-statistics connection {{cite:5a6a9654-b3ab-4206-900e-a679c5a4c101}}. Note that the phase has just two values, FORMULA , and should be robust against perturbations of the closed cycle paths due to its topological character.
Second, despite the above distinction between the conventional geometric phase {{cite:5a8649ba-a442-47d5-9fb3-2ad81cea80c9}} and the topological phase there is a similarity: the phase is associated with the level crossing at FORMULA , which is in fact a hallmark of the former {{cite:5a8649ba-a442-47d5-9fb3-2ad81cea80c9}}, {{cite:65f608c6-f3c9-4b81-ac4c-d2d025ff7972}}. Thus, to obtain the phase factor of FORMULA , the bias-magnetic-field reversal must be adiabatic, otherwise the parameter space FORMULA  becomes topologically trivial {{cite:65f608c6-f3c9-4b81-ac4c-d2d025ff7972}}.
Third, the phase, FORMULA , is parity-dependent. This is a remarkable consequence of quantum mechanics. As mentioned earlier, the reversal of a bias magnetic field is identical to the space inversion FORMULA  for the FORMULA -independent FORMULA  eigenstate, FORMULA . We can say that this is another aspect of the real projective plane. Thus the FORMULA  eigenstate can go to the mirror world just by rotating FORMULA  around the y axis (or x axis). Consequently, whether the phase is non-trivial FORMULA  or trivial 0 depends on whether FORMULA  has odd or even parity.
The principle of the topological phase measurement is based on a Ramsey interrogation scheme {{cite:997026fb-8eac-4977-a5cf-6685fc5e6a02}} for a laser-cooled FORMULA Rb clock-transition pseudospin that consists of FORMULA  and FORMULA . The first microwave FORMULA  pulse tuned to the FORMULA Rb hyperfine splitting rotates the clock-transition pseudospin, say, from the initial state FORMULA  to the superposition state FORMULA  in the bias magnetic field FORMULA  along the z axis. When the detuning, FORMULA , between the hyperfine splitting FORMULA  and the microwave frequency FORMULA  is zero, the clock-transition pseudospin remains in the above superposition state in a frame rotating at FORMULA  as long as the coherence of the pseudospin is preserved. The second microwave FORMULA  pulse rotates the pseudospin to FORMULA , thus the pseudospin is completely flipped. By changing the detuning, FORMULA , and probing the final population of, say, FORMULA , we can obtain the celebrated Ramsey fringes {{cite:997026fb-8eac-4977-a5cf-6685fc5e6a02}}. This is in a sense a measurement of the dynamical phase due to the hyperfine splitting with the FORMULA -detuned microwave field. If, however, the bias magnetic field is adiabatically reversed during the interrogation time, i.e., the time between two resonant FORMULA  pulses, the states FORMULA  and FORMULA  acquire the topological phases FORMULA  and 1, respectively. The resultant superposition state is then FORMULA . In this case we have the state FORMULA  after the second microwave FORMULA  pulse. Accordingly, the topological and parity-dependent phase FORMULA  manifests itself as the FORMULA -phase shifted Ramsey fringes.
FIGURE 
A schematic of the apparatus used in our measurements is shown in Fig. REF . One cycle of measurement consisted of a cooling period (35 ms) and a probing period (5 ms). We began by preparing cold atoms of FORMULA Rb with a magneto-optical trap (MOT) {{cite:997026fb-8eac-4977-a5cf-6685fc5e6a02}}. The quadrupole magnetic field for the MOT was on only for the first 25 ms in the cooling period to reduce the eddy-current-induced magnetic field in the probing period {{cite:7cd9f5ec-4b91-4396-9247-33d929edc5e2}}. The cooling laser was switched off at the end of the cooling period. The probing period began by optically pumping the atoms into the FORMULA  hyperfine state by using a 500-FORMULA W FORMULA -polarized laser tuned to the FORMULA  transition during 150 FORMULA s with the repumping laser tuned to the FORMULA  transition and a bias magnetic field (FORMULA  200 mG) along the z axis as shown in Fig. REF . All the measurements were performed within the last 4 ms in the probing period. Note that during the probing period the stray magnetic fields around the atomic cloud were actively canceled down to less than 1 mG with three magneto-impedance (MI) sensors (Aichi Micro Intelligent) {{cite:d97691f2-6dad-4364-a6d4-3cec12b537d0}} and three pairs of compensating coils for the respective directions {{cite:e775ed55-da2f-4502-8c12-8c868041482d}}.
FIGURE 
Figure REF  (a) shows the linear birefringent phase shift as a function of the detuning of the probe laser from FORMULA  transition. Here, a 1-FORMULA s probe pulse with a diameter of FORMULA  3 mm and a power of 30 FORMULA W propagated through the atomic cloud along the y axis as shown in Fig. REF  and underwent linear birefringent phase shift between x and z polarization components, that is proportional to the quadruple moment of the atomic angular momentum {{cite:d0aabdc3-25bd-41ed-a01f-b5691a9550ab}}, {{cite:ec6c7152-5407-4bc1-abc4-0332cfeb90dc}}. The linear birefringent phase shifts were detected using a shot-noise-limited time-domain balanced polarimeter {{cite:2e6839c2-da83-4090-8d36-f44780351f7c}} with a quarter-wave plate (QWP) and a polarization beam splitter (PBS) and stored in a PC with a boxcar integrator (SRS SR250) and an A/D converter. The optical density of the atomic cloud was roughly estimated to be 2.0 from the fit of the data to the theoretical calculation based on ref. {{cite:d0aabdc3-25bd-41ed-a01f-b5691a9550ab}}, {{cite:ec6c7152-5407-4bc1-abc4-0332cfeb90dc}}.
Figure REF  (b) shows the Rabi oscillations of the clock-transition pseudospins, which were obtained by the birefringent phase-shift measurement under irradiation of the resonant microwave field at the FORMULA Rb ground-state hyperfine splitting {{cite:dc53aa93-f320-4294-8ea8-ef43f05796f9}}. To generate the microwave field with the required precision (for our experiment at least 10 Hz), a rubidium frequency standard (SRS FS725) was used. The 10-MHz reference signal was fed into a 5.8-GHz phase locked signal source (Herley-CTI) and a frequency-variable (up to 1.1 GHz) signal generator (R&S SML01). After mixing the above two signals, filtering out the spurious frequency components, and amplifying the desired frequency components, we converted the signal in the coaxial cable into one in the waveguide and then one in free space with a home-made microwave horn. The resulting microwave field (FORMULA  32 dBm) was then focused on the atomic cloud with a 20 FORMULA  15 cm concave gold-coating microwave mirror. Before the amplifier, there was a PIN diode switch (UMCC) for microwave-pulse clipping. Each point in Fig. REF  (b) corresponds to the average of 100 birefringence measurements. Here, the probe laser was detuned to 100-MHz blue from the FORMULA  transition to diminish any absorptions yet to obtain appreciable birefringence exclusively due to the atoms in the state, FORMULA . Thus, we could measure the population of FORMULA  without destroying the z component of the angular momentum of the collective pseudospin {{cite:ec6c7152-5407-4bc1-abc4-0332cfeb90dc}} and thus with a excellent signal-to-noise ratio. The observed Rabi frequency was about 12.2 kHz and the decay time was about 0.4 ms, which may be primarily due to the inhomogeneity of the microwave power over the atomic cloud. Without irradiation of the microwave field, the decay time was about 5.5 ms and may be interpreted as resulting from atomic diffusion.
FIGURE 
Figure REF  (c) shows the Ramsey fringes, which were obtained by the birefringent phase-shift measurement after the second microwave FORMULA -pulse irradiation. Each point corresponds to the average of 100 birefringence measurements with a given microwave detuning, FORMULA . Here, the interrogation time, i.e., the time between two FORMULA  pulses, was 1 ms, which resulted in the fringe width of 1 kHz. The bias magnetic field of FORMULA  200 mG along the z axis and the active magnetic-field cancellation for the other axes prevented the atoms in FORMULA  states from changing to the other Zeeman sublevels during the interrogation.
Figures REF  (a), (b), (c), and REF  (a) show the Ramsey fringes as a result of reversals of the bias magnetic fields during the interrogation. The ways in which the bias magnetic fields were reversed are presented in Figs. REF  (A), (B), (C), and REF  (A), which show the real traces of the magnetic fields along the z axis (circle) and x axis (cross) probed by the MI sensors (one unit on the vertical scale is roughly equivalent to 40 mG). Here, the interrogation periods are indicated by boxes. Whether the bias-magnetic-field reversal is adiabatic or sudden can be crudely determined by whether FORMULA  or FORMULA  {{cite:57552714-29ec-440a-bf00-c036230b01ae}}, {{cite:65f608c6-f3c9-4b81-ac4c-d2d025ff7972}}, where FORMULA  is the typical time scale of the bias-magnetic-field reversal and FORMULA  is the minimum energy gap between FORMULA  Zeeman sublevel and the nearest one during the reversal. Thus, the reversals shown in Figs. REF  (A), (B), and (C) were supposed to be adiabatic since FORMULA  2 ms and FORMULA  140 kHz, 14 kHz, and 2.8 kHz, respectively; whereas the reversal shown in Fig. REF  (A) was supposed to be sudden since FORMULA  2 FORMULA s and FORMULA  700 Hz (due to the residual magnetic fields about 1 mG). The FORMULA -phase shifted Ramsey fringes in Fig. REF  (a) evidently show that the clock-transition pseudospins acquired the topological and parity-dependent phase FORMULA  as a result of the adiabatic bias-magnetic-field reversal. On the other hand, the Ramsey fringes in Fig. REF  (a) were, as expected, not shifted from the original ones in Fig. REF  (c) since the bias-magnetic-field reversal was sudden. Note that to obtain the Ramsey fringes in Fig. REF  (a), we adjusted the magnetic fields of the x and y axes to be zero with great care, otherwise the residual magnetic fields during the interrogation would have caused the mixing of the Zeeman sublevels and thus resulted in the disappearance of the Ramsey fringes. By the same token, the fringe visibilities in Figs. REF  (b) and (c) worsened as the minimum values of the bias magnetic fields during the interrogation became small. Nevertheless, we can observe the FORMULA -phase shifted Ramsey fringes plainly in Fig. REF  (b) and barely in Fig. REF  (c) showing the robustness of the topological phase per se against perturbations.
FIGURE 
In conclusion, we have observed the topological and parity-dependent phase shift of laser-cooled FORMULA Rb clock-transition pseudospins as a result of a reversal of a bias magnetic field with the Ramsey interrogation scheme. The distinctive features of the phase, i.e., its robustness against perturbations and the relation to adiabaticity, have been confirmed. The unique character of the phase is its parity dependence, which may provide a new scheme for testing parity non-conservation in atoms {{cite:567bc6fc-4815-4250-b529-d8c69a79f82f}}.
