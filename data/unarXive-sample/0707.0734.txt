Abstract: We prove strong theorems for the
local time at infinity of a nearest neighbor transient random
walk. First, laws of the iterated logarithm are given for the
large values of the local time. Then we investigate the length of
intervals over which the walk runs through (always from left to
right) without ever returning.

Introduction
Let FORMULA  be a Markov chain with
FORMULA 
where FORMULA . This sequence
FORMULA  describes the motion of a particle which starts at zero,
moves over the nonnegative integers and going away from 0 with a
larger probability than to the direction of 0. We will be
interested in the case when FORMULA  goes to zero.
That is to say 0 has a repelling power which becomes small if the
particle is far away from 0. We intend to characterize the local
time of this motion.
A slightly different but symmetric variation of the same motion
can be defined as follows.
Let FORMULA  be a Markov chain
with
FORMULA 
Our results can be rephrased with the obvious modification for
this walk as well. However to be in line with the existing
literature we will use the definition in (REF ).
The properties of this model, often called birth and death chain,
connections with orthogonal polynomials in particular, has been treated
extensively in the literature. See e.g. the classical paper by Karlin and
McGregor {{cite:1d58be9e-4cab-4dcd-a19e-2a4d1928c2cd}}, or more recent papers by Coolen-Schrijner and Van
Doorn {{cite:14e5a7f1-2f71-404c-b819-2ae0378c0381}} and Dette {{cite:7d403ca0-e032-43f3-ba62-2928ea1aac22}}.
As it will turn out in this paper, the properties of the
walk and its local time is very sensitive even for small changes
in FORMULA -s.
There is a well-known result in the literature (cf. e.g. Chung
{{cite:5015607a-ea53-406d-9ecd-9d809ee1e074}}) characterizing those sequences FORMULA  for which FORMULA 
is transient (resp. recurrent).
Theorem A: ({{cite:5015607a-ea53-406d-9ecd-9d809ee1e074}}, page 74) Let FORMULA  be a Markov chain
with transition probabilities given in (REF ).
Define
FORMULA 
Then FORMULA  is transient if and only if
FORMULA 
This criteria however does not reveal explicitly what are the
transient/reccurent type of FORMULA  sequences.
Lamperti
{{cite:d936a847-819f-4253-9c69-60e8b453047f}}, {{cite:fcc94587-d2b4-4c9b-b07f-14e4346ffe63}} proved a more general theorem about
recurrence and transience of real nonnegative processes (not
necessarily Markov chains). Here we spell out his result in our
setup only, which easily follows from Theorem A as well.
Corollary: If for all
FORMULA  large enough,
FORMULA 
then FORMULA  is recurrent. If instead, for some  FORMULA
FORMULA 
for FORMULA  large enough, then FORMULA  is transient.
As we proceed to find the necessary tools for getting results
about the local time, as a byproduct,
we will get a much sharper version of this Corollary.
In this paper we concentrate only on the transient case.
There are many results in the literature about the limiting behavior of
FORMULA , depending on the sequence FORMULA  Lamperti {{cite:dbcd127b-49f5-41ce-85b1-0663c0ba71ac}}
determined the limiting distribution of FORMULA .
Theorem B: ({{cite:dbcd127b-49f5-41ce-85b1-0663c0ba71ac}})
If FORMULA , then
FORMULA 
In fact, Lamperti {{cite:dbcd127b-49f5-41ce-85b1-0663c0ba71ac}} (see also Rosenkrantz {{cite:73d9f13d-3849-4113-a286-34f39f7a016d}}) proved
weak convergence of FORMULA  to a Bessel process as well. We
intend to give further connections (strong invariance, etc.) between FORMULA 
and Bessel process in a subsequent paper.
The law of the iterated logarithm for FORMULA  was given by Brézis
et al. {{cite:3b86bbab-25b4-4d1d-b7bf-31b28ce3ded9}}, Székely {{cite:84b336bb-fffb-4b24-8694-a2d47ebe5e94}}, Gallardo {{cite:0070d751-6ada-4924-95bd-2e40639ce353}}, Voit
{{cite:333764bd-9dc9-4b7b-8148-ad879b5c8240}}. Their somewhat more general results specialized in
our setup, reads as follows.
Theorem C: ({{cite:3b86bbab-25b4-4d1d-b7bf-31b28ce3ded9}}, {{cite:84b336bb-fffb-4b24-8694-a2d47ebe5e94}}, {{cite:0070d751-6ada-4924-95bd-2e40639ce353}},
{{cite:333764bd-9dc9-4b7b-8148-ad879b5c8240}})
If FORMULA , then
FORMULA 
Voit {{cite:35e8b9e5-bf76-423b-b837-1df4ec514be4}} has proved a law of large numbers for certain
Markov chains, which we quote in our setup only.
Theorem D: ({{cite:35e8b9e5-bf76-423b-b837-1df4ec514be4}})
If FORMULA  for some FORMULA ,
then
FORMULA 
Our main concern in this paper is to study the local time of
FORMULA , defined by
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 

Lemmas and Notations
For FORMULA  defined in (REF ) we get by elementary calculation
that
Fact 1.
FORMULA 
Introduce the notation
FORMULA 
Denote
FORMULA 
Lemma 2.1. If FORMULA  then for FORMULA  large enough
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is an absolute constant. Consequently,
FORMULA 

Proof: Let FORMULA  then from (REF ) for FORMULA  big enough we have
FORMULA 
Consequently
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
 FORMULA
For FORMULA  define
FORMULA 
i.e. FORMULA  is the probability that a particle
starting from FORMULA  hits FORMULA  before FORMULA .
Lemma 2.2. For  FORMULA
FORMULA 
Especially
FORMULA 

Proof: The proof of this lemma is fairly standard, we
give it for completeness. Clearly we have
FORMULA 
Consequently
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
By iteration we get
FORMULA 
Starting with the trivial identity
FORMULA 
and adding to it the above equations for FORMULA  we get
FORMULA 
i.e.
FORMULA 
Hence (REF ) and (REF ) imply
FORMULA 
Adding these equations we obtain
FORMULA 
Hence we have the lemma.  FORMULA
Introduce the following notations:
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
Note that
FORMULA 
For some FORMULA  fixed, define
FORMULA 
and let
FORMULA 
Now
we are interested in the case FORMULA  above. In fact, in the
future for convenience, when we say that
FORMULA 
we actually mean that FORMULA  is defined by (REF ).
Lemma 2.3.
Let FORMULA .
Then
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
For FORMULA  FORMULA  and FORMULA  big enough
FORMULA 
If FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
FORMULA 

Proof: To prove (REF ), observe that from (REF )
we have for  FORMULA
FORMULA 
Now we give a lower bound for  FORMULA
FORMULA 
It is easy to see that the proof of the upper bound goes the same way,
resulting the same expression as in (REF ) with FORMULA 
replaced by FORMULA  which combined with (REF ) proves (REF ).
The proof of (REF ) is similar, and the rest of the lemma
follows from these two.  FORMULA
Consequence: If for any  FORMULA
FORMULA 
then the Markov chain is recurrent if FORMULA  and transient if
 FORMULA
Now we would like to consider the case when FORMULA  is essentially
FORMULA , which should be understood
in the same way as it was defined in (REF ). Namely, let
FORMULA 
and let
FORMULA 

Lemma 2.4. In case FORMULA 
we have
FORMULA 
FORMULA 

Proof: Consider the case FORMULA  first. By
(REF )
FORMULA 
Consequently,
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
In the calculation above FORMULA  is a positive constant the value of
which is not important. In the future we will use FORMULA  or
FORMULA  for which this remark applies, and their values
might change from line to line. Using substitution and the
asymptotic representation of the incomplete Gamma function (see
e.g. Gradsteyn and Ryzhik {{cite:4b53571b-282f-4b38-a467-88d2ddacbd81}} page 942, formula (8.357))
FORMULA 
we
conclude that as  FORMULA
FORMULA 
A similar calculation (which we omit) gives the same lower bound.
The case of FORMULA  goes along the same lines with obvious
modifications. On the other hand, the case FORMULA  can be
worked out similarly, but it is obvious with less precise
calculations as well.  FORMULA
Lemma 2.5. In case FORMULA  with
FORMULA  there exist FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
FORMULA 

Proof: First we give the upper bound. For  FORMULA
FORMULA 
Then for
FORMULA 
we have
FORMULA 
It is easy to see now, that if FORMULA 
then for an appropriate  FORMULA
FORMULA 
On the other hand, if FORMULA  then for an
appropriate  FORMULA
FORMULA 
Then with  FORMULA
FORMULA 
The lower bound follows from Lemma 2.1.  FORMULA

Local time
We intend to study the limit properties of the local
time FORMULA  in case of transient random walks. To this
end we also define the number of upcrossings by
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
Lemma 3.1. For  FORMULA
FORMULA 
Moreover, the sequence
FORMULA 
is a Markov chain and
FORMULA 

Proof: Clearly we have for  FORMULA
FORMULA 
implying (REF ) by (REF ).
The other statements of the Lemma are obvious.  FORMULA
Theorem 3.1. If FORMULA , as FORMULA , then
FORMULA 
that is to say, FORMULA  and FORMULA 
have exponential limiting distributions.

The proof is a trivial consequence of Lemma 3.1.
Theorem 3.2.
Assume that FORMULA  as FORMULA . Then with probability 1 we
have
FORMULA 
for any FORMULA  if FORMULA  is large enough.
Moreover,
FORMULA 
for any  FORMULA

In case FORMULA  with
FORMULA  instead of (REF ) and (REF ) we have the much
sharper
Theorem 3.3. For FORMULA , FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
Especially in case
FORMULA  FORMULA ,
being FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 

Consequences:

If FORMULA 
then for any  FORMULA
FORMULA 
if FORMULA  is large enough
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 

If  FORMULA
then
FORMULA 
for any FORMULA  and
FORMULA 

If FORMULA  then
FORMULA 
for any FORMULA .

Proof of Theorem 3.2:
(REF ) follows from Lemma 3.1.
On the other hand,
(REF ) also implies that for any  FORMULA
FORMULA 
Now to finish our proof we need to apply the zero-one law (in a
non-independent setup) exactly in the same way as in Doob
{{cite:8b3070e2-bafd-4258-ba54-7f6ab374a408}} page 103, observing that the conditional probability
of our tail event given the first FORMULA  steps of our walk is the
same as its unconditional probability, that is for any  FORMULA
FORMULA 
which, in turn, implies (REF ).
Proof of Theorem 3.3:
To prove (REF ), we need a few lemmas. Recall the
definition of the upcrossing in (REF ). For large values of
the local time and upcrossing we have the following invariance
principle.
Lemma 3.2. As  FORMULA
FORMULA 

Proof: Under the condition FORMULA ,
FORMULA  has binomial distribution with
parameters FORMULA . According to Hoeffding inequality,
FORMULA 
with some FORMULA , from which as FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
Putting FORMULA , we get (REF ) from (REF ).
Lemma 3.3. Let
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
Then
FORMULA 
is a submartingale.

Proof:
Let FORMULA  be the first hitting time of FORMULA  by FORMULA 
e.g. FORMULA  Then we have
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
Observe that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  has distribution (REF ) and
FORMULA  has distribution (REF ). Then
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
hence
FORMULA 
from which
FORMULA 
which easily implies the lemma.  FORMULA
Now we prove the upper bound, i.e.
FORMULA 
which also implies (REF ) by Lemma 3.2.
With an easy calculation we get from (REF ) that
FORMULA 
Using that FORMULA  is submartingale, from (REF ) we have with
FORMULA , FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
It can be seen that the optimal choice for FORMULA  is given by
FORMULA 
and we get finally
FORMULA 
Hence by Borel-Cantelli lemma for large FORMULA  and FORMULA 
we have
FORMULA 
i.e.
FORMULA 
If FORMULA , then (cf. (REF ))
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
If FORMULA , then
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
and if FORMULA , then
FORMULA 
Hence for large FORMULA  and FORMULA  we have
FORMULA 
with some constant FORMULA  if FORMULA  or FORMULA  and FORMULA  if
FORMULA . In view of FORMULA ,
for any FORMULA , one can choose FORMULA  large enough such that
FORMULA 
i.e.
FORMULA 
Since FORMULA  is arbitrary, (REF ) follows.
To prove the lower bound (), consider an
increasing sequence of sites FORMULA  to be determined later.
Let
FORMULA 
the time of the first visit at the site FORMULA  and define
FORMULA 
Observe that FORMULA  are independent.
Following the proof of Lemma 3.1 we can conclude that
FORMULA 
Based on (REF ) it is easy to calculate that
FORMULA 
Define the sequence FORMULA  by
FORMULA 
with some FORMULA  (we intentionally forget about the technicalities
arising from the fact that
the sites should be integers).
It is easy to see that with this choice of  FORMULA
FORMULA 
Let
FORMULA 
From (REF ) we get that
FORMULA 
Applying Borel-Cantelli lemma and then
letting FORMULA , we get ().  FORMULA
Our next issue was to investigate how small could be the local
time of our process. More precisely we wanted to know whether it
is true that in the transient case there are always infinitely
many sites with local time equal to 1. In fact we managed to
prove in some sense much more, and in some sense much less.
Namely, we prove the following two theorems. Define for  FORMULA
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
Theorem 3.4. Let FORMULA  with FORMULA  and
FORMULA . Then

with probability 1 there exist infinitely many FORMULA  for which
FORMULA 
for each FORMULA .

with probability 1 for any FORMULA  and FORMULA  large enough
there exists an  FORMULA
FORMULA 
such that
FORMULA 


Let
FORMULA 
Theorem 3.5. Let FORMULA .
Then

with probability 1 there exists infinitely many FORMULA  for which
FORMULA 
for each FORMULA .

with probability 1
for each FORMULA  large enough and FORMULA  there exists an FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
such that
FORMULA 


Furthermore, we conjecture that for FORMULA , where FORMULA 
with probability 1 there are always infinitely many sites with
local time FORMULA  On the other hand, recently James et al.
{{cite:4b7e9bd8-d2ff-4cab-be87-a779c398e82b}} proved that for FORMULA  with FORMULA 
with probability 1 there are only finitely many cutpoints, hence
finitely many points with local time FORMULA  We note that it can be
seen with a similar argument that this is the case for FORMULA  for all FORMULA  as well.
Proof of Theorem 3.4: At first we prove the second
statement. Recall the notation of FORMULA  and observe
that
FORMULA 
Now the proof of the second statement is a trivial consequence of
Lemma 3.4. For every FORMULA  integer as  FORMULA
FORMULA 

Proof: Obvious by (REF ).  FORMULA
The proof of the first statement of the theorem is based on the
following
Lemma 3.5. For every FORMULA  integer as  FORMULA
FORMULA 
FORMULA 

Proof: (REF ) follows from Lemma
3.1 and (REF ). In case FORMULA  we have
FORMULA 
In case FORMULA  we have
FORMULA 
Hence we have the second statement of the lemma.  FORMULA
Now we turn to the proof of the first
statement of the theorem. Let
FORMULA 
Then by (REF )
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
By (REF ) we have
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
By (REF ) and (REF )
FORMULA 
(REF ), (REF ) and the Kochen-Stone Borel–Cantelli lemma
(see e.g. Spitzer {{cite:ba23c98d-ae16-4308-bc56-17ea6394ad53}}, page 317) imply the first statement
with positive probability. Now to finish our proof we need to
apply the zero-one law (again in a non-independent set up) as in
the proof of Theorem 3.2, observing that for any  FORMULA
FORMULA 
 FORMULA
Proof of Theorem 3.5: The proof goes
along the same line as the proof of Theorem 3.4. The only point
which needs a little different approach is the the proof the
counterpart of Lemma 3.5. Namely, in the proof of this lemma we
need an upper bound for FORMULA , which is equivalent of
getting a lower bound for D(R,S). Observe that in Lemma 2.4 we
have an asymptotic formula for FORMULA  Now to get a lower
bound for FORMULA  we need a less precise calculation (the
statement of Theorem 3.5 does not depend on FORMULA  which was
important in Lemma 2.4). It is enough to observe that
FORMULA 
with an
appropriate choice of FORMULA  and FORMULA  After this observation,
with some tedious calculation somewhat similar to Lemma 2.4, we
get that
FORMULA 
It is easy to see
FORMULA 
if FORMULA  On the other hand, if FORMULA  then it can be seen that
FORMULA 
and this is enough to carry through the argument in Lemma 3.5. We
omit the details.  FORMULA
