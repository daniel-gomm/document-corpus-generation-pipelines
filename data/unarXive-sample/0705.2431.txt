I discuss single top quark production at the Tevatron and the LHC.
The cross section, including soft-gluon threshold corrections through
NNNLO, is presented for each partonic channel. The higher-order corrections
provide significant contributions to the single top cross sections at
both colliders.
Introduction
Single top quark production at hadron colliders can proceed through
three distinct partonic processes: the FORMULA  channel
(FORMULA  and FORMULA )
which involves the exchange of a spacelike FORMULA  boson,
the FORMULA  channel (FORMULA ) which proceeds
via a timelike FORMULA  boson, and
associated FORMULA  production (FORMULA ) {{cite:cd45c535-a1da-43d8-b985-f522be922ca7}}.
The FORMULA  channel processes are numerically the largest at both the
Tevatron and the LHC. At the Tevatron the FORMULA  channel is second in
magnitude and FORMULA  production has the smallest cross section. At the
LHC, FORMULA  production has a much bigger cross section than the FORMULA  channel.
The cross sections for all these processes receive contributions
from soft-gluon emission which can be dominant near
threshold {{cite:5c9d8a3f-1473-46ab-ab28-cef11bf55c62}}, {{cite:5f502769-93f5-4039-90eb-7fc0c75ef3a8}}.
Threshold resummation organizes these contributions and can be used
to compute higher-order corrections for many
processes {{cite:f53cf0f6-2b55-40ec-a1b9-13d1c23106ab}}, {{cite:31ac2183-be75-4b42-b712-9807e534cc7d}}, {{cite:492e23f6-8381-4aa5-91cf-968c9667e1f4}}.
For the partonic process with momenta FORMULA 
we define FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA 
and FORMULA . Near threshold, FORMULA  approaches zero
and the soft-gluon corrections take the form
FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the top quark mass and
FORMULA  for the FORMULA -th order corrections.
We calculate these corrections through next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order
(NNNLO) in the strong coupling FORMULA  at next-to-leading logarithmic
(NLL) accuracy at the
Tevatron {{cite:5c9d8a3f-1473-46ab-ab28-cef11bf55c62}} and the LHC {{cite:5f502769-93f5-4039-90eb-7fc0c75ef3a8}}. This
requires one-loop calculations in the eikonal approximation.
The NLO soft-gluon corrections can be written in the form
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the Born term for each channel and FORMULA  is the
renormalization scale.
For the FORMULA  and FORMULA  channels the leading logarithm coefficient is
FORMULA  while for the FORMULA  channel it is FORMULA ,
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  with FORMULA  the number of colors.
The NLL coefficient is
FORMULA 
for the FORMULA  channel, where FORMULA  is the
factorization scale, and similar expressions can be given for the other
channels. The complete virtual corrections (FORMULA  terms)
cannot be derived from threshold resummation but one can derive the
factorization and renormalization scale terms denoted by FORMULA 
in the above equation {{cite:5c9d8a3f-1473-46ab-ab28-cef11bf55c62}}.
The NNLO soft-gluon corrections for the FORMULA  and FORMULA  channels are
FORMULA 
plus subleading terms {{cite:5c9d8a3f-1473-46ab-ab28-cef11bf55c62}}, where the appropriate expression
for FORMULA  and FORMULA , FORMULA  for each channel must be used, and where
FORMULA  is the lowest-order FORMULA  function, with FORMULA 
the number of light quark flavors.
A similar expression holds for the FORMULA  channel (by deleting
FORMULA  above).
Since this is a NLL calculation, only the leading and NLL terms shown above are
complete. However we can also calculate exactly terms involving FORMULA  and
FORMULA  as well as terms with FORMULA  constants in the subleading logarithms.
Complete expressions and further details are provided in Ref. {{cite:5c9d8a3f-1473-46ab-ab28-cef11bf55c62}}.
The NNNLO soft-gluon corrections for each channel can be written as
FORMULA 
plus subleading terms {{cite:5c9d8a3f-1473-46ab-ab28-cef11bf55c62}}, again with the appropriate expression
for FORMULA  and FORMULA , FORMULA .

Single top quark production at the Tevatron
FIGURE 
We now calculate the contribution of these corrections to the single top
cross section at the Fermilab Tevatron. The MRST 2004 NNLO parton
densities {{cite:f476cdeb-c43c-4fae-b969-3893892b4bb1}} are used for the numerical results. We find that the
threshold corrections are dominant in all partonic channels.
Figure 1 shows the results for the cross section in the FORMULA  channel.
In the left-hand plot we show the leading-order (LO) cross section as well
as the cross sections with the NLO, NNLO, and NNNLO soft-gluon corrections
included versus the top quark mass FORMULA , with the factorization and
renormalization scales set equal to FORMULA . On the right-hand plot we
show the FORMULA  factors, which are the ratios of the higher-order cross sections
to LO. We see that the corrections in this channel are relatively small.
Our best estimate for the cross section is calculated after matching to the
exact NLO cross section {{cite:1243f94f-b478-4280-a592-7f4fe195f4c4}}, i.e. by adding the soft-gluon corrections
through NNNLO to the exact NLO cross section. Below we give results for
two choices of the top quark mass, FORMULA  GeV and FORMULA  GeV. We find
FORMULA  pb
and
FORMULA  pb.
The uncertainty indicated includes the scale dependence and the pdf
uncertainties.
Figure 2 shows the results for the cross section and FORMULA  factors
in the FORMULA  channel. In this channel the corrections are large, providing
up to 65% enhancement of the leading-order cross section.
After matching, we find
FORMULA  pb
and
FORMULA  pb.
The single top cross section at the Tevatron in the FORMULA  channel is
rather small, even though the FORMULA  factors are large (up to 85% enhancement).
Our estimate for the cross section is
FORMULA  pb
and
FORMULA  pb.
For all three channels at the Tevatron the cross section for single anti-top
production is identical to that shown above for single top production.
FIGURE 
Finally, we note that there has been recent evidence for single top quark
production at the Tevatron {{cite:cc72f93b-d8ed-4be1-a2ea-bdede67bd91e}} with a cross section consistent with
the above results.

Single top quark production at the LHC
Next we calculate the threshold corrections for the single top
cross section at the CERN LHC.
It turns out that in the FORMULA  channel the threshold corrections are
not a good approximation of full QCD corrections, hence we only update
the exact NLO result {{cite:1243f94f-b478-4280-a592-7f4fe195f4c4}}, while in the FORMULA  and FORMULA  channels the
threshold approximation holds and we provide results including the NNNLO
soft-gluon corrections. Also at the LHC the cross section for single top
is different from that for single antitop production in the FORMULA  and
FORMULA  channels.
The exact NLO cross section for single top production in the FORMULA  channel
at the LHC is
FORMULA  pb
and
FORMULA  pb.
For single antitop production in the FORMULA  channel
the exact NLO cross section is
FORMULA  pb
and
FORMULA  pb.
Figure 3 (left) shows results for single top production in the FORMULA  channel
at the LHC. The contribution from soft gluons is significant (up to
55% enhancement).
After matching to the exact NLO cross section {{cite:1243f94f-b478-4280-a592-7f4fe195f4c4}}, we find
FORMULA  pb
and
FORMULA  pb.
The corresponding results for single antitop production at the LHC in the
FORMULA  channel are
FORMULA  pb
and
FORMULA  pb.
Here the soft-gluon corrections are somewhat smaller (less than 20%).
Figure 3 (right) shows results for single top production at the LHC in
the FORMULA  channel. This channel has a significant cross section at the LHC.
Also the soft-gluon corrections are quite large, providing around 60%
enhancement.
After matching to the exact NLO cross section {{cite:86f22b7a-8f77-4f1a-9c25-9aadc2586083}}, we find
FORMULA  pb
and
FORMULA  pb.
The cross section for associated antitop production is identical to
that for a top quark.
