Traditionally, longitudinal shower profiles are reconstructed in
fluorescence light experiments by treating the Cherenkov light
contribution as background. Here we will argue that, due to
universality of the energy spectra of electrons and positrons, both
fluorescence and Cherenkov light can be used simultaneously as signal
to infer the longitudinal shower development.
We present a new profile reconstruction method that is based on the analytic
least-square solution for the estimation of the shower profile from the observed
light signal and discuss the extrapolation of the profile
with a Gaisser-Hillas function.
Longitudinal Shower Profile Reconstruction from Fluorescence and
Cherenkov Light2020/09/07 10:21:24
Introduction
During its passage through the atmosphere of the earth an extensive air shower
excites nitrogen molecules of the air, which subsequently radiate isotropically
ultraviolet fluorescence light. Since the amount of emitted light is
proportional to the energy deposited, the longitudinal shower development
can be observed by appropriate optical detectors such as HiRes {{cite:b34df682-25a8-40cd-af76-2d532c870246}},
Auger {{cite:90503fbb-c30b-4079-bec5-9d64885e0802}} or TA {{cite:976c5dae-2586-401b-8b88-17c2a8455fe2}}.
As part of the charged shower particles travel faster than the speed of light in air,
Cherenkov light is emitted in addition. Therefore, in general a mixture of the
two light sources reaches the aperture of the detector.
In the traditional method {{cite:7fb6d99c-87b0-4440-a14f-e6cc13f29f8a}}
for the reconstruction of the longitudinal shower development
the Cherenkov light is iteratively subtracted from
the measured total light. The drawbacks of this ansatz are
the lack of convergence for events with a large amount of
Cherenkov light and the difficulty of propagating the
uncertainty of the subtracted signal to the reconstructed shower profile.
It has already been noted in {{cite:5c8fac06-6971-45ed-b1a0-47c02836b6c0}} that, due to the universality
of the energy spectra of the secondary electrons and positrons within an
air shower, there exists a non-iterative solution for the reconstruction
of a longitudinal shower profile from light detected by fluorescence telescopes.
Here we will present the analytic
least-square solution for the estimation of the shower profile from the observed
light signal in which both, fluorescence and Cherenkov light,
are treated as signal.

Scattered and Direct Light
The non-scattered, i.e. direct fluorescence light emitted at a certain slant depth FORMULA  is measured
at the detector at a time FORMULA . Given the fluorescence yield FORMULA 
{{cite:f55bdaaa-d474-4890-8356-a87ac8dfdee4}}, {{cite:cb17df67-4d97-4a26-a6d1-9a0c2785b931}}
at this point of the atmosphere, the number of photons produced at the shower in a slant
depth interval FORMULA  is
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  denotes the energy deposited at slant depth FORMULA  (cf. Fig. REF ).
These photons are distributed over
a sphere with surface FORMULA , where FORMULA  denotes the distance of the detector.
Due to atmospheric attenuation only a fraction FORMULA  of them can be detected. Given
a light detection efficiency of FORMULA , the measured fluorescence light flux
FORMULA  can be written as
FORMULA 
where the abbreviation
FORMULA  was used. For the sake of clarity
the wave length dependence of FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA 
will be disregarded in the following but be discussed later.
The number of Cherenkov photons emitted at the shower is proportional to the
number of charged particles above the Cherenkov threshold energy. Since the
electromagnetic component dominates the shower development, the emitted Cherenkov light,
FORMULA , can e calculated from
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  denotes the number of electrons and positrons above a certain energy cutoff, which
is constant over the full shower track and not to be confused with the Cherenkov emission
energy threshold. Details of the Cherenkov light
production like these thresholds are included
in the Cherenkov yield factor FORMULA  {{cite:5c8fac06-6971-45ed-b1a0-47c02836b6c0}}, {{cite:9753c7a2-2ca5-4362-b516-c68eacff9466}}, {{cite:cd4d295b-f485-4cf0-b35d-28478103069f}}, {{cite:0e07e60b-4f56-4160-aff0-5714f7a986f1}}.
Although
the Cherenkov photons are emitted in a narrow cone along the particle direction, they
cover a considerable angular range with respect to the shower axis, because
the charged particles are deflected from the primary particle direction due to multiple
scattering. Given the fraction FORMULA  of Cherenkov photons emitted at an angle
FORMULA  with respect
to the shower axis {{cite:9753c7a2-2ca5-4362-b516-c68eacff9466}}, {{cite:0e07e60b-4f56-4160-aff0-5714f7a986f1}}, the light flux at the detector
aperture originating from direct Cherenkov light is
FORMULA 
Due to the forward peaked nature of Cherenkov light production, an intense Cherenkov
light beam can build up along the shower as it traverses the atmosphere (cf. Fig. REF ).
If a fraction FORMULA  of the beam is scattered towards the detector it can
contribute significantly to the total light received. In a simple one-dimensional model
the number of photons in the beam at depth FORMULA  is just the sum of Cherenkov light produced at
all previous depths FORMULA  attenuated on the way from FORMULA  to FORMULA  by FORMULA :
FORMULA 
Similar to the direct contributions, the scattered Cherenkov light received at the detector is then
FORMULA 
Finally, the total light received at the detector at the time FORMULA  is obtained by
adding the scattered and direct
light contributions.

Shower Profile Reconstruction
The aim of the profile reconstruction is to estimate the energy deposit and/or
electron profile from the light flux observed at the detector. At
first glance this seems to be hopeless, since at each depth there are the
two unknown variables FORMULA  and FORMULA , and only one measured quantity,
namely FORMULA .
Since the total energy deposit is just the sum of the energy loss of electrons,
FORMULA  and FORMULA  are related via
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  denotes the normalized electron energy distribution
and FORMULA  is the energy loss of a single electron with energy FORMULA .
As it is shown in {{cite:cd4d295b-f485-4cf0-b35d-28478103069f}}, {{cite:5c8fac06-6971-45ed-b1a0-47c02836b6c0}}, {{cite:0e07e60b-4f56-4160-aff0-5714f7a986f1}}, the electron energy
spectrum FORMULA  is universal in shower age FORMULA ,
i.e. it does not depend on the primary mass or energy, but only on
the relative distance to the shower maximum, FORMULA . Eq. (REF ) can
thus be simplified to
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the average energy deposit per electron at shower age
FORMULA .
With this one-to-one
relation between the energy deposit and the number of electrons, the shower profile
is readily calculable from the equations given in the last section.
For the solution of the problem, it is convenient to rewrite the
relation between energy deposit and
light at the detector
in matrix notation:
Let
FORMULA  be the FORMULA -component vector (histogram) of the measured photon flux at the aperture and
FORMULA  the energy deposit vector at the shower track. Using the ansatz
FORMULA 
the elements of the Cherenkov-fluorescence matrix FORMULA  can be found
by a comparison with the coefficients in equations (REF ), (REF )
and (REF ):
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
The solution of Eq. (REF ) can be obtained by inversion, leading to the energy deposit
estimator FORMULA :
FORMULA 
Due to the triangular structure of the Cherenkov-fluorescence matrix the inverse can
be calculated fast even for matrices with large dimension. As the matrix elements in (REF )
are always FORMULA , FORMULA  is never singular.
The statistical uncertainties of FORMULA  are obtained by error propagation:
FORMULA 
It is interesting to note that even if the measurements FORMULA  are uncorrelated, i.e. their
covariance matrix FORMULA  is diagonal, the calculated energy loss values
FORMULA  are not. This is,
because the light observed during time interval
FORMULA  does not solely originate from FORMULA , but also receives
a contribution from earlier shower parts FORMULA , FORMULA ,
via the 'Cherenkov beam'.

Wavelength Dependence
Until now it has been assumed that the shower induces light emission at a single wavelength FORMULA .
In reality, the fluorescence yield
shows distinct emission peaks and the number of Cherenkov photons is proportional
to FORMULA . In that case, also the wavelength dependence of the
detector efficiency and the light transmission need to be taken into account.
Assuming that a binned wavelength distribution of the yields is available
(FORMULA ), the above considerations still hold when replacing FORMULA  and
FORMULA  in Eq. (REF ) by
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
The detector efficiency FORMULA  and transmission coefficients FORMULA 
and FORMULA  are evaluated at the wavelength FORMULA .

Shower Age Dependence
Due to the age dependence of the electron spectra FORMULA , the
Cherenkov yield factors FORMULA  and the average electron energy deposits FORMULA 
depend on the shower maximum, which is not known before the profile has been reconstructed.
Fortunately, these dependencies are small: In the age range of importance for the
shower profile reconstruction (FORMULA ) FORMULA  varies only within
a few percent {{cite:0e07e60b-4f56-4160-aff0-5714f7a986f1}} and FORMULA  by less than 15% {{cite:5c8fac06-6971-45ed-b1a0-47c02836b6c0}}.
Therefore, a good estimate of FORMULA  and FORMULA  can be obtained by setting
FORMULA . After the shower profile has been calculated with these estimates,
FORMULA  can be determined and the profiles can be re-calculated with an updated
Cherenkov-fluorescence matrix.

Gaisser-Hillas Fit
The knowledge of the complete profile is required for the calculation of the Cherenkov beam
and the shower energy.
If due to the limited field of view of the detector only a part of the profile is observed,
an appropriate function for the extrapolation to unobserved depths is needed.
A possible choice is the Gaisser-Hillas
function {{cite:65cf7db8-9528-42b9-b8eb-c3b2f3f2ad1a}}
which was found to give a good description of measured longitudinal profiles {{cite:5f914c3d-8376-40c8-b17b-197b376d418c}}.
It has only four free parameters:
FORMULA , the depth where the shower reaches its maximum energy deposit FORMULA 
and two shape parameters FORMULA  and FORMULA .
The best
set of Gaisser-Hillas parameters FORMULA  can be obtained by minimizing
the error weighted squared difference between the vector of function
values FORMULA  and FORMULA , which is
FORMULA 
This minimization works well if a large fraction of the shower has been observed
below and above the shower maximum. If this is not the case, or even worse, if the shower
maximum is outside the field of view, the problem is under-determined, i.e. the experimental
information is not sufficient to reconstruct all four Gaisser-Hillas parameters.
This complication can be overcome by weakly constraining FORMULA  and FORMULA  to their
average values FORMULA  and FORMULA . The new
minimization function is then the modified  FORMULA
FORMULA 
where the variance of FORMULA  and FORMULA  around their mean values are in the denominators.
In this way, even if FORMULA  is not sensitive to FORMULA  and FORMULA , the minimization
will still converge. On the other hand, if the measurements have small statistical uncertainties and/or
cover a wide range in depth, the minimization function is flexible enough to allow for
shape parameters differing from their mean values. These mean values can be determined
from air shower simulations or, preferably, from high quality data profiles which can be
reconstructed without constraints.
