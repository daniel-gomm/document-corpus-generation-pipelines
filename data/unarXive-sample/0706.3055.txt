The Einstein universe is the conformal compactification of Minkowski
space. It also arises as the ideal boundary of anti-de Sitter space.
The purpose of this article is to develop the synthetic geometry of
the Einstein universe in terms of its homogeneous submanifolds and
causal structure, with particular emphasis on dimension FORMULA , in
which there is a rich interplay with symplectic geometry.

Introduction
We will explore the geometry of the conformal compactification of
Minkowski FORMULA –space inside of FORMULA . We shall call this
conformal compactification FORMULA , or the Einstein universe,
and its universal cover will be denoted FORMULA . The
Einstein universe is a homogeneous space FORMULA , where
FORMULA , and FORMULA  is a parabolic subgroup. When
FORMULA , then FORMULA  is locally isomorphic to FORMULA .
The origin of the terminology “Einstein universe” is that A. Einstein himself considered as a paradigmatic universe the product
FORMULA  endowed with the Lorentz metric FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the usual constant curvature Riemannian
metric on FORMULA . The conformal transformations preserve the class of
lightlike geodesics and provide a more flexible geometry than that
given by the metric tensor.
Our motivation is to understand conformally flat
Lorentz manifolds and the Lorentzian analog of Kleinian groups. Such
manifolds are locally homogeneous geometric structures modeled on FORMULA .
The Einstein universe FORMULA  is the conformal compactification of Minkowski space FORMULA  in the
same sense that the FORMULA -sphere
FORMULA 
conformally compactifies Euclidean space  FORMULA; in particular, a Lorentzian analog of the following theorem holds (see {{cite:6e43ebfd-3e71-4be3-94da-fb9c9f93d846}}):
Theorem 0.1 (Liouville's theorem)  Suppose FORMULA . Then every
conformal map FORMULA  defined on a nonempty connected
subdomain FORMULA  extends to a conformal automorphism FORMULA 
of FORMULA . Furthermore FORMULA  lies in the group FORMULA 
generated by inversions in hyperspheres and Euclidean isometries.

Our viewpoint involves various geometric objects in Einstein
space: points are organized into 1-dimensional submanifolds which we
call photons, as they are lightlike geodesics. Photons in turn
form various subvarieties, such as lightcones and hyperspheres. For
example, a lightcone is the union of all photons through a given
point. Hyperspheres fall into two types, depending on the signature
of the induced conformal metric. Einstein hyperspheres are
Lorentzian, and are models of FORMULA , while spacelike
hyperspheres are models of FORMULA  with conformal Euclidean geometry.
The Einstein universe FORMULA  can be constructed by projectivizing
the nullcone in the inner product space FORMULA  defined by a
symmetric bilinear form of type FORMULA . Thus the points of
FORMULA  are null lines in FORMULA , and photons correspond
to isotropic 2-planes. Linear hyperplanes FORMULA  in FORMULA 
determine lightcones, Einstein hyperspheres, and spacelike
hyperspheres, respectively, depending on whether the restriction of
the bilinear form to FORMULA  is degenerate, type FORMULA , or
Lorentzian, respectively.
Section  discusses causality in Einstein space.
Section  is specific to dimension 3,
where the conformal Lorentz group is locally isomorphic to the group
of linear symplectomorphisms of FORMULA . This establishes a close
relationship between the symplectic geometry of FORMULA  (and hence the
contact geometry of FORMULA ) and the conformal Lorentzian geometry of FORMULA .
Section  reinterprets these synthetic
geometries in terms of the structure theory of Lie algebras.
Section  discusses the dynamical theory of discrete subgroups
of FORMULA  due to Frances {{cite:a6384c52-2470-4bbb-93de-b2268e63dae0}},
and begun by Kulkarni {{cite:0b790ca7-017f-49f9-95df-fcf088281da8}}.
Section  discusses the
crooked planes, discovered by Drumm {{cite:e1ef7240-aef8-4e34-a73a-fb76d1c47623}}, in the
context of FORMULA ; their closures, called crooked surfaces
are studied and shown to be Klein bottles invariant under the
Cartan subgroup of FORMULA . The paper concludes with
a brief description of discrete groups of conformal transformations
and some open questions.
Much of this work was motivated by the thesis of Charles
Frances {{cite:6e43ebfd-3e71-4be3-94da-fb9c9f93d846}}, which contains many constructions and
examples, his paper {{cite:a6384c52-2470-4bbb-93de-b2268e63dae0}} on Lorentzian Kleinian groups, and
his note {{cite:6e43ebfd-3e71-4be3-94da-fb9c9f93d846}} on compactifying crooked planes. We are
grateful to Charles Frances and Anna Wienhard for many useful
discussions.
We are also grateful to the many institutions where we have been able
to meet to discuss the mathematics in this paper. In particular, we
are grateful for the hospitality provided by the Banff International
Research Station {{cite:3495fc6e-abc8-41e8-949f-987ce99fd521}} where all of us were able to meet for a

“Discrete groups and geometric structures,” the miniconference in
Lorentzian geometry at the E.N.S. Lyon in July 2005, the special
semester at the Newton Institute in Cambridge in Fall 2005, the
special semester at the Erwin Schrödinger Institute in Fall 2005,
and a seminar at the University of Maryland in summer 2006, when
the writing began.

Synthetic geometry of  FORMULA
In this section we develop the basic synthetic geometry of Einstein space, or the Einstein universe, starting with the
geometry of Minkowski space FORMULA .
Lorentzian vector spaces
We consider real inner product spaces, that is, vector spaces FORMULA 
over FORMULA  with a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form FORMULA .
A nonsingular symmetric FORMULA -matrix FORMULA 
defines a symmetric bilinear form on FORMULA  by the rule:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  denotes the transpose of the vector FORMULA .
We shall denote by FORMULA  a real inner product space whose inner product is of type FORMULA . For example, if
FORMULA 
then
FORMULA 
defines a type FORMULA  inner product, induced by the matrix FORMULA  on FORMULA .
The group of linear automorphisms of FORMULA  is FORMULA .
If FORMULA  is positive definite—that is, FORMULA —then we say that the
inner product space FORMULA  is Euclidean.
If FORMULA , then FORMULA  is Lorentzian.
We may omit reference to the bilinear form if it is clear from context.
If FORMULA  is Lorentzian, and FORMULA , then FORMULA  is:

timelike if FORMULA ;

lightlike (or null or isotropic)
if FORMULA ;

causal if FORMULA ;

spacelike if FORMULA .

The nullcone FORMULA  in FORMULA  consists of all null vectors.

If FORMULA , then define its orthogonal complement:
FORMULA 
The hyperplane FORMULA  is null (respectively, timelike,
spacelike) if FORMULA  is null (respectively spacelike, timelike).
In the sequel, according to the object of study, we will consider
several symmetric FORMULA -matrices and the associated type FORMULA 
symmetric bilinear forms. For different bilinear forms, different
subgroups of FORMULA  are more apparent. For example:

Using the diagonal matrix
FORMULA 
invariance under the maximal compact subgroup
FORMULA 
is more apparent.

Under the bilinear form defined by the matrix
FORMULA 
(if FORMULA ),
invariance under the Cartan subgroup
FORMULA 
is more apparent.

Another bilinear form which we use in the last two sections is:
FORMULA 
which is useful in extending subgroups of FORMULA  to FORMULA .


Minkowski space
Euclidean space FORMULA  is the model space for Euclidean
geometry, and can be characterized up to isometry as a simply connected,
geodesically complete, flat Riemannian manifold.
For us, it will be simpler to describe it as an affine space whose underlying vector space of translations is a
Euclidean inner product space FORMULA . That means FORMULA  comes equipped
with a simply transitive vector space of translations
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is a point and FORMULA  is a vector
representing a parallel displacement. Under this simply transitive
FORMULA -action, each tangent space FORMULA  naturally identifies
with the vector space FORMULA . The Euclidean inner product on FORMULA 
defines a positive definite symmetric bilinear form on each tangent
space—that is, a Riemannian metric.
Minkowski space FORMULA  is the Lorentzian analog. It is
characterized up to isometry as a simply connected, geodesically
complete, flat Lorentzian manifold. Equivalently, it is an affine
space whose underlying vector space of translations is FORMULA .
The geodesics in FORMULA  are paths of the form

R En,1
t  p0 + t v

where FORMULA  is a point and FORMULA  is a vector. A path FORMULA  as above is timelike, lightlike, or spacelike, if the velocity FORMULA  is timelike, lightlike, or spacelike, respectively.
Let FORMULA . The affine lightcone FORMULA  at FORMULA 
is defined as the union of all lightlike geodesics through FORMULA :
FORMULA 
Equivalently FORMULA  where FORMULA  denotes
the nullcone in FORMULA . The hypersurface FORMULA  is ruled
by lightlike geodesics; it is singular only at FORMULA . The
Lorentz form on FORMULA  restricts to a degenerate metric on
FORMULA .

A lightlike geodesic FORMULA  lies in a unique null affine hyperplane.
(We denote this FORMULA , slightly abusing notation.)
That is, writing FORMULA , where FORMULA  is a lightlike vector, the null hyperplane FORMULA  is independent of the choices
of FORMULA  and FORMULA  used to define FORMULA .
The de Sitter hypersphere of radius FORMULA  centered at FORMULA  is defined as
FORMULA 
The Lorentz metric on FORMULA  restricts to a Lorentz metric on FORMULA 
having constant sectional curvature FORMULA . It is geodesically
complete and homeomorphic to FORMULA . It is a model for
de Sitter space FORMULA .
As in Euclidean space, a homothety (centered at FORMULA )  is any map conjugate by a translation to scalar multiplication:

En,1 En,1
x  x0 + r (x - x0) .

A Minkowski similarity transformation is a composition of

an isometry of FORMULA  with a homothety:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  defines a translation.
Denote the group of similarity transformations of FORMULA  by
FORMULA .

Einstein space
Einstein space FORMULA  is the projectivized nullcone of FORMULA .
The nullcone is
FORMULA 
and the FORMULA -dimensional Einstein universe
FORMULA  is the image
of FORMULA  under projectivization:
FORMULA 
In the sequel, for notational convenience, we will denote FORMULA  as a map from
FORMULA , implicitly assuming that the origin 0 is removed from any
subset of FORMULA  on which we apply FORMULA .
The double covering FORMULA  is defined as the
quotient of the nullcone FORMULA  by the action by positive scalar
multiplications. For many purposes the double covering may be more
useful than FORMULA , itself. We will also consider the universal
covering FORMULA  in §.
Writing the bilinear form on FORMULA  as FORMULA , that is,
FORMULA 
the nullcone is defined by
FORMULA 
This common value is always nonnegative, and if it is zero, then
FORMULA  and FORMULA  does not correspond to a point in FORMULA . Dividing by
the positive number FORMULA  we may assume
that
FORMULA 
which describes the product FORMULA . Thus
FORMULA 
Scalar multiplication by FORMULA  acts by the antipodal map on both the
FORMULA  and the FORMULA -factor. On the FORMULA -factor the antipodal map is
a translation of order two, so the quotient
FORMULA 
is homeomorphic to the mapping torus of the antipodal map on FORMULA .
When FORMULA  is even,
FORMULA  is nonorientable and FORMULA  is an orientable double covering.
If FORMULA  is odd, then FORMULA  is orientable.
The objects in the synthetic geometry of FORMULA 
are the following collections of points in FORMULA :

Photons are projectivizations of totally isotropic 2-planes.
We denote the space of photons by FORMULA . 
A photon enjoys the natural structure of a real projective line: each photon FORMULA 
admits projective parametrizations, which are diffeomorphisms of FORMULA  with FORMULA  such that if FORMULA  is an automorphism of FORMULA  preserving FORMULA ,
then FORMULA  corresponds to a projective transformation of FORMULA .
The projective parametrizations are unique up to post-composition with transformations in FORMULA .

Lightcones are singular hypersurfaces.
Given any point FORMULA ,
the lightcone FORMULA  with vertex  FORMULA
is the union of all photons containing FORMULA :
FORMULA 
The lightcone FORMULA  can be equivalently defined as
the projectivization of the orthogonal complement FORMULA .
The only singular point on FORMULA  is FORMULA ,
and FORMULA  is homeomorphic to FORMULA .


The Minkowski patch FORMULA  determined by an element FORMULA  of FORMULA 
is the complement of FORMULA  and has the natural structure of
Minkowski space FORMULA , as will be explained in § below.
In the double cover, a point FORMULA  determines two Minkowski
patches:

Min+(p)  :=
{qEinn,1p, q > 0  p,q Rn+1,2
 representing  p, q
}
Min-(p)  :=
{qEinn,1p, q < 0  p,q Rn+1,2  representing  p, q
} .

There are two different types of hyperspheres.

Einstein hyperspheres are closures in FORMULA  of de
Sitter hyperspheres FORMULA  in Minkowski patches as defined in
§REF . Equivalently, they are projectivizations of FORMULA 
for spacelike vectors FORMULA . 

Spacelike hyperspheres are one-point compactifications of
spacelike hyperplanes like FORMULA  in a Minkowski patch FORMULA . Equivalently, they are projectivizations of
FORMULA  for timelike vectors FORMULA .



An anti-de Sitter space FORMULA  is one component of the
complement of an Einstein hypersphere FORMULA . It
is homeomorphic to FORMULA . Its ideal boundary
is FORMULA .


2-dimensional case
Because of its special significance, we discuss in detail the geometry
of the 2-dimensional Einstein universe FORMULA .

FORMULA  is diffeomorphic to a 2-torus.

Each lightcone FORMULA  consists of two photons which intersect at FORMULA .

FORMULA  has two foliations FORMULA  and FORMULA  by photons, and the lightcone
FORMULA  is the union of the leaves through FORMULA  of the respective foliations.

The leaf space of each foliation naturally identifies with FORMULA , and
the mapping
FORMULA 
is equivariant with respect to the isomorphism
FORMULA 

Here is a useful model (compare Pratoussevitch {{cite:85d9cb3f-cb3c-4aa4-a09e-6806b0ea2d1a}}):
The space FORMULA  of FORMULA  real matrices
with the bilinear form associated to the determinant gives an isomorphism
of inner product spaces:

Mat2(R) R2,2
m11  m12
m21  m22  m11
m12
m21
m22 
where FORMULA  is given the bilinear form defined by
FORMULA 
The group FORMULA  acts on FORMULA  by:
FORMULA 
and induces a local isomorphism
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
Here we will briefly introduce stems, which are pieces of
crooked planes, as will be discussed in §
below. Let FORMULA  be two points not contained in a
common photon. Their lightcones intersect in two points FORMULA  and
FORMULA , and the union
FORMULA 
comprises four photons
intersecting in the four points FORMULA , such that each
point lies on two photons and each photon contains two of these
points. This stem configuration  of
four points and four photons can be represented schematically as in
Figure REF  below.
FIGURE 
The complement
FORMULA 
consists of four quadrilateral regions (see Figure REF ).
In § the union FORMULA  of two non-adjacent quadrilateral
regions will be studied; this is the stem of a crooked
surface. Such a set is bounded by the four photons
of FORMULA .
FIGURE 

3-dimensional case
Here we present several observations particular to the
case of FORMULA .

We will see that FORMULA  identifies naturally
with a 3-dimensional real projective space (§REF ).

A lightcone in FORMULA  is homeomorphic to a
pinched torus.

Suppose FORMULA . Define
FORMULA 
If FORMULA  and FORMULA  are incident,—that is, they lie on a common photon—then FORMULA  is the unique photon containing them. Otherwise FORMULA  is a submanifold that we will call a spacelike circle.
Spacelike circles are projectivized nullcones of linear subspaces of
FORMULA  of type FORMULA . The closure of a spacelike
geodesic in FORMULA  is a spacelike circle. 

A timelike circle is the projectivized nullcone of
a linear subspace of FORMULA  of metric type FORMULA .

Einstein hyperspheres in FORMULA  are copies of FORMULA . In addition to their two rulings by photons, they have a foliation by spacelike circles.

Lightcones may intersect Einstein hyperspheres in two different ways.
These correspond to intersections of degenerate linear hyperplanes in
FORMULA  with linear hyperplanes of type FORMULA . Let FORMULA  be vectors such that
FORMULA  is degenerate, so FORMULA  determines a lightcone FORMULA , and FORMULA  has type FORMULA , so FORMULA  defines the Einstein hypersphere FORMULA .
In terms of inner products,
FORMULA 
If FORMULA , then FORMULA  span a nondegenerate subspace
of signature FORMULA . In that case FORMULA  is a spacelike circle.
If FORMULA , then FORMULA  span a degenerate subspace
and the intersection is a lightcone in FORMULA , which is a union of two
distinct but incident photons.

Similarly, lightcones intersect spacelike hyperspheres in two different ways.
The generic intersection is a spacelike circle, and the non-generic
intersection is a single point, such as the intersection of FORMULA  with
the spacelike plane FORMULA  in FORMULA .

A pointed photon is a pair FORMULA  such
that FORMULA . Such a pair naturally extends to a triple
FORMULA 
which corresponds to an isotropic flag, that is, a linear
filtration of  FORMULA
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the 1-dimensional linear subspace corresponding
to FORMULA ; FORMULA  is the 2-dimensional isotropic subspace corresponding
to FORMULA ; and FORMULA  is the orthogonal subspace of FORMULA . These objects
form a homogeneous space, an incidence variety, denoted FORMULA , of FORMULA , which fibers both over FORMULA  and FORMULA .
The fiber of the fibration FORMULA  over a point FORMULA 
is the collection of all photons through FORMULA .
The fiber of the fibration FORMULA  over a photon FORMULA 
identifies with all the points of FORMULA . Both fibrations are circle bundles.




FORMULA  as the conformal compactification of  FORMULA
Now we shall describe the geometry of FORMULA  as the compactification
of Minkowski space FORMULA . We begin with the Euclidean analog.
The conformal Riemannian sphere
The standard conformal compactification of Euclidean space FORMULA  is
topologically the one-point compactification, the FORMULA -dimensional
sphere. The conformal Riemannian sphere FORMULA  is the
projectivization FORMULA  of the nullcone of FORMULA .
For FORMULA  an arbitrary open set, any local section
FORMULA 
of the restriction of the projectivization map to FORMULA  determines a pullback of the Lorentz metric
on FORMULA  to a Riemannian metric FORMULA  on FORMULA .
This metric depends on FORMULA , but its conformal class is independent
of FORMULA .
Every section is FORMULA  for some non-vanishing function FORMULA . Then
FORMULA 
so the pullbacks are conformally equivalent.
Hence the metrics FORMULA  altogether define a canonical conformal
structure on FORMULA .
The orthogonal group FORMULA  leaves invariant the nullcone
FORMULA . The projectivization
FORMULA 
is invariant under the projective orthogonal group FORMULA ,
which is its conformal automorphism group.
Let
FORMULA 
be the section taking
values in the unit Euclidean sphere. Then the metric FORMULA  is
the usual FORMULA -invariant spherical metric.
Euclidean space FORMULA  embeds in FORMULA 
via a spherical paraboloid in the nullcone FORMULA . Namely
consider the quadratic form on FORMULA  defined by
FORMULA 
The map

En  Nn+1,1Rn+1,1
x  x
x,x
1 
composed with projection FORMULA  is an
embedding FORMULA  of FORMULA  into FORMULA , which is conformal.
The Euclidean similarity transformation

FORMULA 
where FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA , is represented by
FORMULA 
That is, for every FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
Inversion in the unit sphere 
FORMULA  of FORMULA  is represented by the element
FORMULA 
which acts on FORMULA  by:
FORMULA 
The origin is mapped to the point (called FORMULA )
having homogeneous coordinates
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the zero vector.

The map FORMULA  is a coordinate chart on the open set
FORMULA 
and FORMULA  is a coordinate chart on the open set
FORMULA .

The conformal Lorentzian quadric
Consider now the inner product space FORMULA . Here it will
be convenient to use the inner product

u,v  := u1 v1 + ...+ un vn - un+1vn+1
- 12 un+2vn+3 - 12 un+3vn+2
 = u†(In -I1
- 1/2 0  1
1  0 ) v .

In analogy with the Riemannian case, consider the embedding
FORMULA  via
a hyperbolic paraboloid defined by (REF ) as above,
where the Lorentzian inner product on FORMULA  is defined by
FORMULA .
The procedure used previously in the Riemannian case
naturally defines an FORMULA -invariant conformal Lorentzian
structure on FORMULA , and the embedding we have just defined is
conformal.
Minkowski similarities FORMULA  map into FORMULA  as in
the formula (REF ), where
FORMULA ; FORMULA 
is the Lorentzian inner product on FORMULA ; and FORMULA  is replaced by FORMULA .
The conformal compactification of Euclidean space is the one-point
compactification; the compactification of Minkowski space, however, is
more complicated, requiring the addition of more than a single
point.
Let FORMULA  denote the origin, corresponding to
FORMULA 
To see what lies at infinity,
consider the Lorentzian inversion in the unit sphere

defined by the matrix FORMULA ,
which is given on FORMULA  by the formula
FORMULA 
Here the whole affine lightcone FORMULA  is thrown to
infinity. We distinguish the points on FORMULA :

The improper point FORMULA  is the image FORMULA .
It is represented in homogeneous coordinates by
FORMULA 

The generic point on
FORMULA  has homogeneous coordinates
FORMULA 
where FORMULA ; it equals FORMULA .

We have described all the points in
FORMULA 
which are the points defined by vectors FORMULA  with
coordinates FORMULA  or FORMULA . It remains to
consider points having homogeneous coordinates
FORMULA 
where necessarily FORMULA .
This equation describes the nullcone in FORMULA ; its projectivization is a spacelike
sphere FORMULA , which we call the ideal sphere.
When FORMULA , we call this the ideal circle and its elements ideal points.
Each ideal point is the endpoint of a unique null geodesic from the origin; the union of that null
geodesic with the ideal point is a photon through the origin. Every
photon through the origin arises in this way.
The ideal sphere is fixed by the inversion FORMULA .
The union of the ideal sphere FORMULA  with FORMULA 
is the lightcone FORMULA  of the improper point. Photons in FORMULA  are called ideal photons.
Minkowski space FORMULA  is thus the complement of a lightcone
FORMULA  in FORMULA . This fact motivated the earlier definition of
a Minkowski patch FORMULA  as the complement in FORMULA 
of a lightcone FORMULA .
Changing a Lorentzian metric by a non-constant scalar factor modifies timelike and spacelike geodesics, but not images of null
geodesics (see for example {{cite:29fc55eb-b005-4543-8ad4-1929bb62548a}}, p. 307).
Hence the notion of (non-parametrized) null geodesic is
well-defined in a conformal Lorentzian manifold.
For FORMULA , the null geodesics are photons.

Involutions
When FORMULA  is even, involutions in
FORMULA 
correspond to nondegenerate splittings of FORMULA .
For any involution in
FORMULA , the fixed point set in FORMULA  must be one of the following:

the empty set FORMULA ;

a spacelike hypersphere;

a timelike circle;

the union of a spacelike circle with two points;

an Einstein hypersphere.

In
the case that FORMULA  is disconnected and equals
FORMULA 
where FORMULA , and FORMULA  is a spacelike circle,
then
FORMULA 
Conversely, given any two non-incident points FORMULA , there is a
unique involution fixing FORMULA  and the spacelike circle
FORMULA .
Inverting photons
Let FORMULA  be the improper point, as above. A photon in FORMULA 
either lies on the ideal lightcone FORMULA , or it intersects the
spacelike plane FORMULA  consisting of all
FORMULA 
for which FORMULA . Suppose FORMULA  is a photon intersecting FORMULA 
in the point FORMULA 
with polar coordinates
FORMULA 
Let FORMULA  be the null vector
FORMULA 
and consider the parametrized lightlike geodesic
FORMULA 
for FORMULA . Then inversion FORMULA  maps FORMULA  to
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
Observe that FORMULA  leaves invariant the spacelike plane FORMULA 
and acts by Euclidean inversion on that plane.

Extending planes in FORMULA  to  FORMULA

The closure of a null plane FORMULA  in FORMULA  is a lightcone
and its frontier FORMULA  is an ideal photon.
Conversely a lightcone with vertex on the ideal circle FORMULA 
is the closure of a null plane containing FORMULA , while a lightcone with vertex on
FORMULA 
is the closure of a null plane not containing FORMULA .

The closure of a spacelike plane in FORMULA  is
a spacelike sphere and its frontier is the improper point FORMULA .

The closure of a timelike plane in FORMULA  is
an Einstein hypersphere and its frontier is a union of two ideal photons
(which intersect in FORMULA ).

The closure of a timelike (respectively spacelike)
geodesic in FORMULA  is a timelike (respectively spacelike)
circle containing FORMULA , and FORMULA  is its frontier.

Consider the inversion on the lightcone of FORMULA :
FORMULA 
The entire image of the light cone
FORMULA  lies outside the Minkowski patch FORMULA .
Let us now look at the image of a timelike line in FORMULA 
under the inversion. For example,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA . That is, the inversion maps the timelike line
minus the origin to itself, albeit with a change in the
parametrization.

Causal geometry
In §REF  we observed that FORMULA  is
naturally equipped with a conformal structure. This structure lifts to the double cover FORMULA . As in the Riemannian case in §REF ,
a global representative of the conformal structure on FORMULA  is the pullback by
a global section FORMULA  of the ambient
quadratic form of FORMULA .
The section FORMULA  taking values in the set where
FORMULA 
exhibits a homeomorphism FORMULA  as in §REF ; it is now apparent that
FORMULA  is conformally equivalent to FORMULA  endowed with the Lorentz metric FORMULA , where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the usual round
metrics on the spheres FORMULA  and FORMULA  of radius one.
In the following, elements of FORMULA  are denoted by FORMULA .
In these coordinates, we distinguish the timelike vector field
FORMULA  tangent to the fibers FORMULA .
Time orientation
First consider Minkowski space
FORMULA  with underlying vector space FORMULA  equipped with the
inner product:
FORMULA 
A vector FORMULA  in FORMULA  is causal if FORMULA . It is future-oriented
(respectively past-oriented) if the coordinate FORMULA  is
positive (respectively negative);


equivalently, FORMULA  is future-oriented if its inner product with
FORMULA 
is negative.
The key point is that the choice of the coordinate
FORMULA —equivalently, of an everywhere timelike vector field like
FORMULA —defines a decomposition of every affine lightcone
FORMULA  in three parts:

FORMULA ;

The future lightcone FORMULA  of elements FORMULA  where
FORMULA  is a future-oriented null vector;


The past lightcone FORMULA  of elements FORMULA  where
FORMULA  is a past-oriented null vector.


The above choice is equivalent to a continuous choice of one of the
connected components of the set of timelike vectors based at each FORMULA ; timelike vectors in these components are designated future-oriented. In other words, FORMULA  defines a
time orientation on FORMULA .
To import this notion to FORMULA , replace
FORMULA  by the vector field FORMULA  on FORMULA . Then a causal
tangent vector FORMULA  to FORMULA  is future-oriented (respectively past-oriented) if the inner product
FORMULA  is negative (respectively positive).
We already observed in §REF  that the antipodal map
is FORMULA  on FORMULA ; in particular, it preserves the timelike vector field FORMULA ,
which then descends to a well-defined vector field on FORMULA , so that
FORMULA  is time oriented, for all integers FORMULA .
Remark 1.1 The Einstein universe does not have
a preferred Lorentz metric in its conformal class. The definition
above is nonetheless valid since it involves only signs of inner
products and hence is independent of the choice of metric in
the conformal class.

The group FORMULA  has four connected components.

More precisely, let FORMULA  be the subgroup of
FORMULA  formed by elements with determinant 1; these are the orientation-preserving conformal
transformations of FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be the subgroup comprising the
elements preserving the
time orientation of FORMULA .
The identity component of FORMULA  is the intersection
FORMULA 
Moreover, FORMULA  and FORMULA  each have two
connected components.
The center of FORMULA 
has order two and is generated by the antipodal map, which belongs
to FORMULA  if and only if FORMULA  is odd.
Hence the center of
FORMULA  is trivial if FORMULA  is even—in particular,
when FORMULA . On the other hand, the antipodal map always preserves the
time orientation.
The antipodal map is the only element of
FORMULA  acting trivially on FORMULA . Hence the
group of conformal transformations of FORMULA  is
FORMULA , the quotient of FORMULA 
by its center. When FORMULA  is even, FORMULA  is
isomorphic to FORMULA .

Future and past
A FORMULA -immersion
FORMULA 
is a causal curve
(respectively a timelike curve)
if the tangent vectors FORMULA  are all causal (respectively timelike).
This notion extends to any conformally
Lorentzian space—in particular, to FORMULA , FORMULA , or
FORMULA . Furthermore, a causal curve FORMULA  is
future-oriented (respectively past-oriented) if all the tangent
vectors FORMULA  are future-oriented (respectively past-oriented).


Let FORMULA  be a subset of FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  or
FORMULA . The future FORMULA  (respectively
the past FORMULA ) of FORMULA  is the set comprising
endpoints FORMULA  of future-oriented (respectively past-oriented)
timelike curves with starting point FORMULA  in FORMULA . The causal
future FORMULA  (respectively the causal past FORMULA ) of FORMULA  is the set
comprising endpoints FORMULA  of future-oriented (respectively
past-oriented) causal curves
with starting point FORMULA  in FORMULA .
Two points FORMULA , FORMULA  are causally related

if one belongs to the causal future of the other: FORMULA . The notion of future and past in FORMULA 
is quite easy to understand: FORMULA  belongs to the future FORMULA  of FORMULA 
if and only if FORMULA  is a future-oriented timelike element of FORMULA .
Thanks to the conformal model, these notions are also quite easy to
understand in FORMULA , FORMULA  or FORMULA : let FORMULA  be the spherical distance on the homogeneous Riemannian sphere FORMULA  of radius 1.
The universal covering FORMULA  is conformally isometric to the Riemannian
product FORMULA  where the real line FORMULA  is endowed with
the negative quadratic form FORMULA .
Hence, the image of any causal, FORMULA , immersed curve in
FORMULA  is the graph of a map FORMULA  where FORMULA  is an interval in FORMULA  and where FORMULA  is 1-Lipschitz —that is, for all FORMULA , FORMULA  in FORMULA :
FORMULA 
Moreover, the causal curve is timelike if and only if the map FORMULA  is
contracting—that is, satisfies
FORMULA 
It follows that the future of an element FORMULA  of
FORMULA  is:
FORMULA 
and the causal future FORMULA  of an element FORMULA  of
FORMULA  is the closure of the future FORMULA :
FORMULA 
As a corollary, the future FORMULA  of a nonempty subset FORMULA  of
FORMULA  or FORMULA  is the entire spacetime. In other words, the notion of past or
future is relevant in FORMULA , but not in FORMULA  or
FORMULA .
There is, however, a relative
notion of past and future still relevant in FORMULA  that will be
useful later when considering crooked planes and surfaces: let FORMULA , FORMULA  be two elements of FORMULA  such that FORMULA .
First observe that the intersection FORMULA 
is never empty. Let FORMULA  be any element of this intersection, so FORMULA  contains FORMULA  and FORMULA .
The time orientation on FORMULA  induces a time orientation on such a Minkowski patch FORMULA .
Fact 2.1 The points FORMULA  and FORMULA  are causally related in FORMULA 
if and only if, for any lifts FORMULA  of FORMULA , respectively, to FORMULA ,
the inner product FORMULA  is positive.


Hence, if FORMULA  and FORMULA  are causally
related in some Minkowski patch, then they are causally related in any
Minkowski patch containing both of them. Therefore,
(slightly abusing language)
we use the following convention: two
elements FORMULA , FORMULA  of FORMULA  are causally
related if the inner product FORMULA  in FORMULA  is positive for any lifts FORMULA .

Geometry of the universal covering
The geometrical understanding of the embedding of Minkowski space in
the Einstein universe can be a challenge. In particular,
the closure in FORMULA  of a subset of a Minkowski patch may be not
obvious, as we will see for crooked planes. This difficulty arises
from the nontrivial topology of FORMULA .
On the other hand, the topology of the universal covering FORMULA 
is easy to visualize; indeed, the map

Einn,1Sn R S
Rn+1 { 0 }
S : (, ) ()
is an embedding. Therefore, FORMULA  can be considered as a subset of
FORMULA —one that is particularly easy to visualize when
FORMULA . Observe that the map FORMULA  is
FORMULA -equivariant for the natural actions on FORMULA  and FORMULA .
The antipodal map
FORMULA 
lifts to the automorphism FORMULA  of
FORMULA 
defined by
FORMULA 
In the coordinates FORMULA  this lifting
FORMULA  is expressed by FORMULA ,
where FORMULA .
Since null geodesics in FORMULA  are photons, the images by FORMULA  of null geodesics
of FORMULA  are curves in
FORMULA  characterized by the following properties:

They are contained in 2-dimensional linear subspaces;

Each is a logarithmic spiral in the 2-plane containing it.

Hence, for FORMULA , the lightcone of an element FORMULA  of FORMULA  (that is, the union of the null geodesics
containing FORMULA ) is a singular surface of revolution in FORMULA  obtained by rotating a spiral contained in a vertical 2-plane around an axis of the plane.
In particular, for every FORMULA  in FORMULA , every null geodesic
containing FORMULA  contains FORMULA . The image FORMULA  is uniquely characterized by the following properties, so that it can be called the first future-conjugate point to FORMULA :


It belongs to the causal future FORMULA ;

For any FORMULA  such that FORMULA  belongs to all null geodesics containing FORMULA , we have  FORMULA

All these considerations allow us to visualize how Minkowski patches embed
in FORMULA  (see Figure REF ):
let FORMULA  and FORMULA  be its projection to FORMULA . The
Minkowski patch FORMULA  is the projection in FORMULA  of
FORMULA , which can also
be defined as FORMULA .
The projection in FORMULA  of
FORMULA 
is the Minkowski patch FORMULA , which is the set of points non-causally related to FORMULA .
FIGURE 

Improper points of Minkowski patches
We previously defined the improper point FORMULA  associated to a
Minkowski patch in FORMULA : it is the unique point such that the
Minkowski patch is FORMULA .
In the double-covering FORMULA , to every Minkowski patch are attached two improper points:

the spatial improper point, the unique element FORMULA  such that the given Minkowski patch is FORMULA ;


 the timelike improper point, the unique element FORMULA  such that the given Minkowski patch is FORMULA .


Let FORMULA  be a Minkowski patch in
FORMULA . Let
FORMULA 
be a geodesic. Denote by FORMULA  the image of FORMULA , and by
FORMULA  the closure in FORMULA  of FORMULA .

If FORMULA  is spacelike, then
FORMULA 

If FORMULA  is timelike, then
FORMULA 

If FORMULA  is lightlike, then
FORMULA  is a photon avoiding
FORMULA  and FORMULA .


Four-dimensional real symplectic vector spaces
In spatial dimension FORMULA , Einstein space FORMULA  admits an alternate
description as the Lagrangian Grassmannian, the manifold FORMULA  of
Lagrangian 2-planes in a real symplectic vector space FORMULA  of dimension
4. There results a

kind of
duality between the conformal Lorentzian geometry
of FORMULA  and the symplectic geometry of FORMULA . Photons correspond
to linear pencils of Lagrangian 2-planes (that is, families of Lagrangian
subspaces passing through a given line). The corresponding local isomorphism
FORMULA 
manifests the isomorphism of root systems of type FORMULA  (the odd-dimensional
orthogonal Lie algebras) and FORMULA  (the symplectic Lie algebras)
of rank 2. We present this correspondence below.

The inner product on the second exterior power
Begin with a four-dimensional vector space FORMULA  over FORMULA  and choose
a fixed generator
FORMULA 
The group of automorphisms of FORMULA  is the special linear group
FORMULA .
The second exterior power FORMULA  has dimension 6. The action of
FORMULA  on FORMULA  induces an action on
FORMULA  which preserves the bilinear form
FORMULA 
defined by:
FORMULA 
This bilinear form satisfies the following properties:

FORMULA  is symmetric;

FORMULA  is nondegenerate;

FORMULA  is split—that is, of type FORMULA .

(That FORMULA  is split follows from the fact that any orientation-reversing
linear automorphism of FORMULA  maps FORMULA  to its negative.)
The resulting homomorphism
FORMULA 
is a local isomorphism of Lie groups, with kernel FORMULA  and image the identity component of FORMULA .
Consider a symplectic form FORMULA  on FORMULA —that is, a skew-symmetric
nondegenerate bilinear form on FORMULA . Since FORMULA  is nondegenerate,
FORMULA  defines a dual exterior bivector FORMULA  by
FORMULA 
We will assume that
FORMULA 
Thus FORMULA , so that its symplectic complement
FORMULA 
is an inner product space of type FORMULA .
Now the local isomorphism
(REF ) restricts to a local isomorphism
FORMULA 
with kernel FORMULA  and image the identity component of FORMULA .

Lagrangian subspaces and the Einstein universe
Let FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  and
FORMULA  be as above.
The projectivization of the null cone in FORMULA  is equivalent to FORMULA .
Points in FORMULA  correspond to Lagrangian planes in FORMULA —that is,
2-dimensional linear subspaces FORMULA  such that the
restriction FORMULA . Explicitly, if FORMULA  constitute
a basis for FORMULA , then the line generated by the bivector
FORMULA 
is independent of the choice of basis for FORMULA .
Furthermore, FORMULA  is null with respect to FORMULA  and orthogonal
to FORMULA , so FORMULA  generates a null line in FORMULA ,
and hence defines a point in FORMULA .
For the reverse correspondence, first note that a point of FORMULA  is
represented by a vector FORMULA  such that FORMULA .
Elements FORMULA  with FORMULA  are exactly the
decomposable ones—that is, those that can be written
FORMULA  for FORMULA .
Then the condition FORMULA  is
equivalent by construction to FORMULA , so FORMULA  represents a
Lagrangian plane, FORMULA , in FORMULA . Thus Lagrangian 2-planes in FORMULA  correspond to isotropic lines in FORMULA .
For a point FORMULA , denote by FORMULA  the corresponding Lagrangian plane in FORMULA .
Complete flags
A photon FORMULA  in FORMULA  corresponds to a line FORMULA  in FORMULA , where
FORMULA 
A pointed photon FORMULA , as defined in §REF , corresponds to a pair of linear subspaces
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the line corresponding to FORMULA  and
where FORMULA  is the Lagrangian plane of corresponding to FORMULA . Recall that the incidence relation FORMULA  extends to
FORMULA 
corresponding to the complete linear flag
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the null plane projectivizing to FORMULA .
The linear inclusion (REF ) extends to a linear flag
FORMULA 
where now FORMULA  denotes the symplectic orthogonal of FORMULA .
Clearly the lightcone FORMULA  corresponds to the linear
hyperplane FORMULA .

Pairs of Lagrangian planes
Distinct Lagrangian subspaces FORMULA  may intersect in either a line
or in 0.
If FORMULA ,
the corresponding points FORMULA  are incident.
Otherwise
FORMULA 
and the linear involution of  FORMULA
FORMULA 
is anti-symplectic :
FORMULA 
The corresponding involution of FORMULA  fixes the two points FORMULA  and the
spacelike circle FORMULA .
It induces a time-reversing involution of FORMULA .


Symplectic planes
Let FORMULA  be a symplectic plane, that is, one for which
the restriction FORMULA  is nonzero (and hence nondegenerate).
Its symplectic complement FORMULA  is also a symplectic plane,
and
FORMULA 
is a symplectic direct sum decomposition.
Choose a basis FORMULA  for FORMULA .
We may assume that FORMULA .
Then
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
lies in FORMULA 
since FORMULA . Furthermore

B(P,P)  = 
B(2 u1u2, 2 u1u2) + 2 B( 2 u1u2, *)
+ B(*,*)
 = 0 + 4 - 2
 = 2.

whence FORMULA  is a positive vector in FORMULA . In particular
FORMULA  is an Einstein hypersphere.
The two symplectic involutions leaving FORMULA  (and necessarily also FORMULA )
invariant
FORMULA 
induce maps fixing FORMULA , and acting
by FORMULA 
on FORMULA .
The corresponding eigenspace decomposition
is FORMULA  and the corresponding conformal involution
in FORMULA  fixes an Einstein hypersphere.


Positive complex structures and the Siegel space
Not every involution of FORMULA  arises from a linear involution
of FORMULA . Particularly important are those which arise
from compatible complex structures, defined as follows.
A complex structure on FORMULA  is an automorphism
FORMULA  such that
FORMULA . The pair FORMULA  then inherits the structure
of a complex vector space for which FORMULA  is the underlying
real vector space. The complex structure FORMULA  is compatible
with the symplectic vector space FORMULA  when
FORMULA 
(In the language of complex differential geometry,
the exterior 2-form FORMULA  has Hodge type 
FORMULA  on the complex vector space FORMULA .) Moreover

V V  C
(v,w)  (v,Jw) + i (v,w)

defines a Hermitian form on FORMULA .
A compatible complex structure FORMULA  on FORMULA  is positive if FORMULA  whenever FORMULA .
Equivalently, the symmetric bilinear form defined by
FORMULA 
is positive definite. This is in turn equivalent to the above Hermitian
form being positive definite.
The positive compatible complex structures on FORMULA  are parametrized by the symmetric space of FORMULA . A convenient model is the Siegel upper-half space FORMULA , which can be realized as
the domain of FORMULA  complex symmetric matrices with positive definite imaginary part (Siegel {{cite:346aeee1-db37-4f6b-a3ca-43f04229a79d}}).

A matrix FORMULA  acts on a complex structure FORMULA  by
FORMULA 
and the stabilizer of any FORMULA  is conjugate to FORMULA , the group of unitary transformations of FORMULA .
Let the symplectic structure
FORMULA  be defined by the FORMULA -block matrix
FORMULA 
This matrix also defines a complex structure.
Write FORMULA  as a block matrix with
FORMULA 
where the blocks FORMULA  are FORMULA  real matrices.
Because FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
The condition that FORMULA  preserves the complex structure FORMULA  means
that FORMULA  commutes with FORMULA , which
together with (REF ), means that
FORMULA 
that is, FORMULA .
Thus the stabilizer of the pair FORMULA  is FORMULA ,
which identifies with the unitary group FORMULA  as follows.
If FORMULA  commutes with FORMULA , then its block entries satisfy
FORMULA 
Relabelling FORMULA  and FORMULA , then
FORMULA 
corresponds to a complex matrix FORMULA .
This matrix is symplectic if and only if FORMULA  is unitary,
FORMULA 

The contact projective structure on photons
The points of a photon correspond to Lagrangian planes in FORMULA 
intersecting in a common line.
Therefore, photons correspond to linear 1-dimensional subspaces in FORMULA ,
and the photon space FORMULA  identifies with the projective
space FORMULA . This space has a natural contact geometry defined below.
Recall that a contact structure on a manifold FORMULA  is
a vector subbundle FORMULA  of codimension one that is maximally non-integrable:
FORMULA  is locally the kernel of a nonsingular 1-form FORMULA 
such that FORMULA  is nondegenerate at every point. This condition is independent of the 1-form FORMULA 
defining FORMULA , and is equivalent to the condition that any two points
in the same path-component can be joined by a smooth curve with
velocity field in FORMULA . The 1-form FORMULA  is called a contact 1-form defining FORMULA .
For more details on contact geometry, see {{cite:94c40884-6e92-4f29-a592-7f274c029753}}, {{cite:e2d647be-431d-4af7-abb0-65f13339fda9}}, {{cite:b6f43bad-2da1-442b-8cee-6dc83c06b14f}}.
The restriction of FORMULA  to FORMULA  is a nondegenerate exterior 2-form,
making FORMULA  into a symplectic vector bundle. Such a vector bundle
always admits a compatible complex structure FORMULA  (an automorphism
such that FORMULA ), which gives FORMULA  the structure of a
Hermitian vector bundle. The contact structure we define on
photon space FORMULA  will have such Hermitian structures and
contact 1-forms arising from compatible complex structures on the symplectic
vector space FORMULA .
Construction of the contact structure
Let FORMULA  be nonzero, and denote the corresponding line by
FORMULA . The tangent space FORMULA  naturally identifies with
FORMULA  (FORMULA  denotes the 1-dimensional subspace
of FORMULA , as well). If FORMULA  is a hyperplane complementary to
FORMULA , then an affine patch for FORMULA  containing FORMULA  is
given by

Hom([v],V1)  AV1 P(V)
 [v + (v)] .

That is, FORMULA  is the graph of the linear map FORMULA 
in FORMULA . This affine patch defines an isomorphism
FORMULA 
that is independent of the choice of FORMULA .

Now, since FORMULA  is skew-symmetric, symplectic product with FORMULA  defines
a linear functional

V/[v]  v R
u  (u,v).

The hyperplane field
FORMULA 
is a well-defined
contact plane field on FORMULA .

It posseses a unique transverse orientation; we denote
a contact 1-form for this hyperplane field by FORMULA .


The contact structure and polarity
The contact structure and the projective geometry of FORMULA 
interact with each other in an interesting way.
If FORMULA , then the contact structure at FORMULA  is
a hyperplane FORMULA .
There is a unique projective hyperplane
FORMULA  tangent to FORMULA  at FORMULA .
Conversely, suppose FORMULA  is a projective hyperplane.
The contact plane field is transverse to FORMULA  everywhere but one point,
and that point FORMULA  is the unique point for which FORMULA .
This correspondence results from the correspondence between
a line FORMULA 
and its symplectic orthogonal FORMULA .
The above correspondence is an instance of a polarity in projective
geometry. A polarity of a projective space FORMULA  is a projective
isomorphism between FORMULA  and its dual FORMULA , arising from a nondegenerate bilinear form
on FORMULA , which can be either symmetric or skew-symmetric.
Another correspondence is between the set of photons through a given point FORMULA  and the set of 1-dimensional linear suspaces of the Lagrangian plane
FORMULA . The latter set projects to a projective line in FORMULA  tangent to the contact plane field, a contact projective
line. All contact projective lines arise from points in FORMULA  in this way.

Relation with positive complex structures on  FORMULA
A compatible positive complex structure FORMULA  defines a contact vector field
for the contact structure as follows.
Let FORMULA  be a subdomain.
For any nonzero FORMULA , the map FORMULA  defines an element of
FORMULA , that is, a tangent vector in FORMULA . The
resulting vector field FORMULA  satisfies FORMULA 
for any 1-form FORMULA  defining the contact structure,
since FORMULA  for nonzero FORMULA . More generally, for any
smooth map FORMULA , this
construction defines a contact vector field.



The Maslov cycle
Given a FORMULA -dimensional symplectic vector space FORMULA  over FORMULA ,
the set FORMULA  of Lagrangian subspaces of FORMULA 
is a compact homogeneous space.
It identifies with
FORMULA , given a choice of a positive compatible
complex structure on FORMULA .

The fundamental group
FORMULA 
An explicit isomorphism is given by the Maslov index,
which associates to a loop FORMULA  in FORMULA  an integer.
(See McDuff-Salamon {{cite:94c40884-6e92-4f29-a592-7f274c029753}}, §2.4 for a general discussion.)
Let FORMULA  be a Lagrangian subspace.
The Maslov cycle FORMULA 
associated to FORMULA  is the subset of FORMULA  consisting of FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
Although it is not a submanifold, FORMULA  carries a natural co-orientation
(orientation of its conormal bundle) and defines a cycle whose homology
class generates FORMULA  where
FORMULA 
The Maslov index of a loop FORMULA  is the oriented intersection number of FORMULA 
with the Maslov cycle (after FORMULA  is homotoped to be transverse to
FORMULA ).

If FORMULA  corresponds to a Lagrangian subspace FORMULA , then the Maslov cycle FORMULA  corresponds to the lightcone FORMULA . (We thank A. Wienhard for this observation.)

Summary
We now have a dictionary between the symplectic geometry of
FORMULA  and the orthogonal geometry of FORMULA :

TABLE 

Lie theory of FORMULA  and  FORMULA
This section treats the structure of the Lie algebra FORMULA  and the
isomorphism with FORMULA . We relate differential-geometric properties
of the homogeneous spaces FORMULA  and FORMULA  with
the Lie algebra representations corresponding to the isotropy. This
section develops the structure theory (Cartan subalgebras, roots,
parabolic subalgebras) and relates these algebraic notions to the
synthetic geometry of the three parabolic homogenous spaces FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and FORMULA . Finally, we discuss the geometric significance of
the Weyl group of FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Structure theory
Let FORMULA , equipped with the symplectic form FORMULA , as above.
We consider a symplectic basis FORMULA  in which FORMULA  is
FORMULA 
The Lie algebra FORMULA  consists of all FORMULA  real matrices FORMULA 
satisfying
FORMULA 
that is,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .
Cartan subalgebras
A Cartan subalgebra FORMULA  of FORMULA 
is the subalgebra stabilizing the four coordinate lines FORMULA  for
FORMULA , and comprises the diagonal matrices
FORMULA 
for FORMULA . The calculation
FORMULA 
implies that the eight linear functionals assigning to FORMULA  the values
FORMULA 
define the root system

 := {
(2,0),(-2,0), (0,2), (0,-2),
       (1,-1), (1,1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1)
}  a*

pictured below.

FIGURE 

Positive and negative roots
A vector FORMULA  such that FORMULA  for all roots
FORMULA  partitions FORMULA  into positive roots FORMULA 
and negative roots FORMULA  depending on whether
FORMULA  or FORMULA  respectively. For example,
FORMULA 
partitions FORMULA  into

+  = {  (2,0), (1,1), (0,2), (-1,1)  }
-  = {  (-2,0), (-1,-1), (0,-2),(1,-1)  }.

The positive roots
FORMULA 
form a pair of simple positive roots in the sense that every
FORMULA  is a positive integral linear combination of
FORMULA  and FORMULA . Explicitly:
FORMULA 

Root space decomposition
For any root FORMULA , define the root space
FORMULA 
In FORMULA ,
each root space is one-dimensional, and the elements
FORMULA  are
called root elements. The Lie algebra decomposes as a direct sum
of vector spaces:
FORMULA 
For more details, see Samelson {{cite:b21b6f12-e10c-417a-bda0-eb6b44afbe96}}.

Symplectic splittings
The basis vectors FORMULA  span a symplectic plane FORMULA 
and FORMULA  span its symplectic complement FORMULA .
These planes define a symplectic direct sum decomposition
FORMULA 
The subalgebra FORMULA  preserving FORMULA 
also preserves FORMULA 
and consists of matrices of the form (REF )
that are block-diagonal:
FORMULA 
Thus

hP sp(2,R) sp(2,R)
 sl(2,R) sl(2,R) .

The Cartan subalgebra FORMULA  of FORMULA  is also a Cartan subalgebra of
FORMULA , but only the four long roots

' = { (2,0),(0,2)} =
{, (+ 2)}

are roots of FORMULA . In particular FORMULA  decomposes as
FORMULA 

The Orthogonal Representation of  FORMULA
Let FORMULA  be a symplectic basis for FORMULA  as above and
FORMULA 
a volume element for FORMULA .
A convenient basis for FORMULA  is:

f1  := e1 e3
f2  := e2 e3
f3  := 12(e1 e2 - e3 e4 )
f4  := e4 e1
f5  := e2 e4

for which the matrix
FORMULA 
defines the bilinear form FORMULA  associated to this volume element.
The matrix FORMULA  defined in (REF ) above maps to
FORMULA 
For a fixed symplectic plane FORMULA , such as the one spanned by
FORMULA  and FORMULA , denote by FORMULA  the subspace of
FORMULA  of elements that can be written in the form FORMULA , where FORMULA  and FORMULA  for all FORMULA .
The restriction of the bilinear form FORMULA  to this
subspace, which has basis FORMULA , is type FORMULA .
Its stabilizer is the image FORMULA  of FORMULA 
in FORMULA . Note that this image is isomorphic to
FORMULA 

Parabolic subalgebras
The homogeneous spaces FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  identify with
quotients FORMULA  of FORMULA  where FORMULA  is a proper
parabolic subgroup.
When FORMULA  is algebraic, then any parabolic subgroup
FORMULA  of FORMULA  is algebraic, and the quotient FORMULA  is a compact
projective variety. See Chapter 7 of {{cite:b2d7ff69-dfc4-48a2-908e-1cd79494fba0}} for more details.

As usual, working with Lie algebras is more convenient. We denote the corresponding parabolic
subalgebras by FORMULA , and they are indexed by subsets
FORMULA  of the set FORMULA  of simple
negative roots, as follows.
The Borel subalgebra or minimal parabolic subalgebra
corresponds to FORMULA  and is defined as
FORMULA 
In general, let FORMULA  be the set of finite sums of elements of FORMULA .
The parabolic subalgebra determined by FORMULA  is
FORMULA 


The Borel subalgebra and  FORMULA
Let FORMULA  be the Borel subalgebra defined above.
The corresponding Lie subgroup FORMULA  is the stabilizer of a unique
pointed photon, equivalently, an isotropic flag, in FORMULA ; thus
FORMULA  identifies with the homogeneous space FORMULA .
The subalgebra
FORMULA 
is the Lie algebra of the unipotent radical of FORMULA 
and is 3-step nilpotent. A realization of the corresponding group is the group
generated by the translations of FORMULA  and a unipotent
one-parameter subgroup of FORMULA .

The parabolic subgroup corresponding to  FORMULA
Now let FORMULA ; the corresponding parabolic subalgebra
FORMULA  is the stabilizer subalgebra of a
line in FORMULA , or, equivalently, of a point in FORMULA .
In FORMULA  this parabolic is the stabilizer of a null plane in FORMULA , or, equivalently, of
a photon in FORMULA .

The parabolic subgroup corresponding to  FORMULA
Now let FORMULA ; the corresponding parabolic subalgebra
FORMULA  is the stabilizer subalgebra of a
Lagrangian plane in FORMULA , or, equivalently, a contact projective line
in FORMULA . In FORMULA , this parabolic is the stabilizer of a null line in FORMULA , or, equivalently, of
a point in FORMULA .

Weyl groups
The Weyl group FORMULA  of FORMULA  is isomorphic to a dihedral
group of order 8 (see Figure REF ).
It acts by permutations on elements of the quadruples in FORMULA 
corresponding to a basis of FORMULA .

Let FORMULA  be the connected subgroup of FORMULA , with
Lie algebra FORMULA . In the symplectic basis FORMULA , it
consists of matrices of the form
FORMULA 
The semigroup FORMULA  with FORMULA  corresponds to an
open Weyl chamber in FORMULA . For FORMULA , let FORMULA  be the
image in FORMULA  of the hyperplane spanned by FORMULA  for FORMULA .
The point FORMULA  is an attracting fixed point for all
sequences in FORMULA , and FORMULA  is a repelling fixed point:
 Any unbounded FORMULA  converges
uniformly on compact subsets of FORMULA  to the
constant map FORMULA , while FORMULA  converges to FORMULA  uniformly
on compact subsets of FORMULA . On FORMULA , an unbounded sequence FORMULA  converges to FORMULA ,
while on FORMULA , the inverses FORMULA 
converge to FORMULA .
We will call the point FORMULA  a
codimension-one attracting fixed point
for sequences in FORMULA  and FORMULA  a
codimension-one repelling fixed point.
Every Weyl chamber has associated to it a
dynamical quadruple like FORMULA ,
consisting of an attracting fixed point, a repelling fixed point,
a codimension-one attracting fixed point, and a codimension-one repelling fixed
point.
Conversely, given a symplectic basis FORMULA , the intersection of the stabilizers in FORMULA  of the lines FORMULA  is a Cartan subgroup FORMULA . The elements FORMULA  such that FORMULA  is a dynamical quadruple for the sequence FORMULA  form a
semigroup FORMULA  that is an open Weyl chamber in FORMULA .
The Weyl group acts as a group of permutations of
such a quadruple. These permutations must preserve a stem
configuration as in Figure REF , where now two
points are connected by an edge if the corresponding lines in FORMULA  are
in a common Lagrangian plane, or, equivalently, the two points of
FORMULA  span a line tangent to the contact structure.
The permissible permutations are those preserving the partition FORMULA .
In FORMULA , the Weyl group consists of permutations of four points
FORMULA  of FORMULA  in a stem configuration that preserve
the configuration.
A Weyl chamber again corresponds to a dynamical quadruple FORMULA  of fixed points, where now sequences FORMULA 
converge to the constant map FORMULA  on the complement of FORMULA  and
to FORMULA  on FORMULA ; the inverse
sequence converges to FORMULA  on the complement of FORMULA  and to FORMULA 
on FORMULA .

Three kinds of dynamics
In this section, we present the ways sequences in FORMULA  can
diverge to infinity in terms of projective singular limits. In
{{cite:a6384c52-2470-4bbb-93de-b2268e63dae0}}, Frances defines a trichotomy for sequences diverging
to infinity in FORMULA : they have bounded, mixed, or
balanced distortion. He introduces limit sets for such
sequences and finds maximal domains of proper discontinuity for
certain subgroups of FORMULA . We translate Frances' trichotomy to
FORMULA , along with the associated limit sets and maximal domains
of properness.
Projective singular limits
Let FORMULA  be a finite-dimensional vector space, and let FORMULA  be a sequence of elements of FORMULA . This
sequence induces a sequence FORMULA  of
projective transformations of FORMULA . Let FORMULA  be an auxiliary
Euclidean norm on FORMULA  and let FORMULA  be the associated operator
norm on the space of endomorphisms FORMULA . The
division of FORMULA  by its norm FORMULA  does not modify
the projective transformation FORMULA . Hence we can assume that
FORMULA  belongs to the FORMULA -unit sphere of
FORMULA . This sphere is compact, so FORMULA  admits accumulation points. Up to a subsequence, we can
assume that FORMULA  converges to an element
FORMULA  of the FORMULA -unit sphere. Let FORMULA  be the image of
FORMULA , and let FORMULA  be the kernel of FORMULA . Let
FORMULA 
be the induced map.
Proposition 1.1 
For any compact FORMULA , the
restriction of the sequence FORMULA  on FORMULA  converges uniformly to
the restriction on FORMULA  of FORMULA .

Corollary 1.2 
Let FORMULA  be a discrete subgroup of
FORMULA . Let FORMULA  be the open subset of FORMULA 
formed by points admitting a neighborhood FORMULA  such that, for any
sequence FORMULA  in FORMULA  with accumulation point FORMULA 
having image FORMULA  and kernel FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
Then FORMULA  acts properly discontinuously on FORMULA .

In fact, the condition FORMULA  is sufficient to
define FORMULA  (as is FORMULA ). To see this,
note that if FORMULA  with

gn/gn  g
gn-1/gn-1  g-,

then
FORMULA 
Hence
FORMULA 

Cartan's decomposition  FORMULA
When FORMULA  is a sequence in a semisimple Lie
group FORMULA , a very convenient way to identify the
accumulation points FORMULA  is to use the FORMULA -decomposition in FORMULA : first select
the Euclidean norm FORMULA  so that it is preserved by the maximal compact
subgroup FORMULA  of FORMULA . Decompose every
FORMULA  in the form FORMULA , where FORMULA  and FORMULA 
belong to FORMULA , and FORMULA  belongs to a fixed Cartan
subgroup. We can furthermore require that FORMULA  is the image by the
exponential of an element of the closure of a Weyl chamber. Up to a
subsequence, FORMULA  and FORMULA  admit limits FORMULA  and
FORMULA , respectively. Composition on the right or on the left
by an element of FORMULA  does not change the operator norm,
so FORMULA  has FORMULA -norm 1 if and only if FORMULA  has
FORMULA -norm 1. Let FORMULA  be an accumulation point of
FORMULA . Then
FORMULA 
The kernel of FORMULA  is the
image by FORMULA  of the kernel of FORMULA , and the
image of FORMULA  is the image by FORMULA  of the image of
FORMULA . Hence, in order to find the singular projective limit
FORMULA , the main task is to find the limit FORMULA ,
and this problem is particularly easy when the rank of
FORMULA  is small.
Sequences in  FORMULA
The image by the exponential map of a Weyl chamber in FORMULA  is
the semigroup FORMULA  of matrices (see §REF ):
FORMULA 
The operator norm of FORMULA  is FORMULA .
We therefore can distinguish three kinds of dynamical
behaviour for a sequence
FORMULA :

no distortion: when FORMULA  and
FORMULA  remain bounded, 

bounded distortion: when FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are unbounded, but the difference FORMULA  is bounded, 

unbounded distortion: when the sequences FORMULA 
and FORMULA  are unbounded.


This distinction
extends to any sequence FORMULA 
in FORMULA . Assume that the sequence
FORMULA  converges to a limit
FORMULA . Then:

For no distortion, the limit FORMULA  is not
singular—the sequence FORMULA  converges in
FORMULA .

For bounded distortion, the kernel FORMULA  and the image FORMULA 
are 2-dimensional. More precisely, they are Lagrangian subspaces of
FORMULA . The singular projective transformation FORMULA  is
defined in the complement of a projective line and takes values in a
projective line; these projective lines are both tangent everywhere to
the contact structure.

For unbounded distortion, the singular projective transformation
FORMULA  is defined in the complement of a projective
hyperplane and admits only one value.


Sequences in  FORMULA
The Weyl chamber of FORMULA  is simply the image of the Weyl
chamber of FORMULA  by the differential of the homomorphism
FORMULA 
defined in §6.2. More precisely,
the image of an element FORMULA  of FORMULA  is FORMULA  where
FORMULA 
and:
FORMULA 
The FORMULA  decomposition of FORMULA  above corresponds under the homomorphism to a FORMULA  decomposition of FORMULA . Reasoning as in the previous section, we distinguish three cases:

no distortion: when FORMULA  and FORMULA 
remain bounded,

balanced distortion: when FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are unbounded, but the difference FORMULA  is bounded, 

unbalanced distortion:
when the sequences FORMULA  and FORMULA 
are unbounded.


The dynamical analysis is similar, but we restrict to the closed
subset FORMULA  of FORMULA :

No distortion corresponds to sequences FORMULA 
converging in FORMULA .

For balanced distortion, the intersection between
FORMULA  and FORMULA , and the intersection
between FORMULA  and FORMULA  are both photons.
Hence the restriction of the singular projective transformation
FORMULA  to FORMULA  is defined in the complement of a photon and
takes value in a photon.

For unbalanced distortion, the singular projective transformation
FORMULA  is defined in the complement of a lightcone and admits only
one value.


Maximal domains of properness
Most of the time, applying directly Proposition  and Corollary REF  to a discrete subgroup
FORMULA  of FORMULA  or FORMULA  in order to find domains
where the action of FORMULA  is proper is far from optimal.
Through the morphism FORMULA , a sequence in
FORMULA  can also be considered as a sequence in
FORMULA . Observe that our terminology is coherent: a sequence has
no distortion in FORMULA  if and only if it has no distortion in
FORMULA . Observe also that since

a1  = 1 + 2,
a2  = 2 - 1,

a sequence with bounded distortion in FORMULA  is unbalanced in
FORMULA , and a sequence with balanced distortion in
FORMULA  is unbounded in FORMULA . In summary, we
distinguish three different kinds of non-converging dynamics, covering
all the possibilities:
Definition 3.1 A sequence FORMULA  of elements of FORMULA 
escaping from any compact subset in FORMULA  has:

bounded distortion if the coefficient FORMULA  is bounded,

balanced distortion if the coefficient
FORMULA  is bounded,

mixed distortion if all the coefficients FORMULA ,
FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  are unbounded.



Action on  FORMULA
The dynamical analysis can be refined in the mixed distortion case.
In {{cite:a6384c52-2470-4bbb-93de-b2268e63dae0}}, C. Frances proved:
Proposition 3.2 
Let FORMULA  be a sequence of elements of
FORMULA  with mixed distortion, such that the sequence
FORMULA  converges to an
endomorphism FORMULA . Then there are photons FORMULA  and
FORMULA  in FORMULA  such that, for any sequence FORMULA  in FORMULA  converging to an element of FORMULA , all the accumulation points of FORMULA  belong to FORMULA .

As a corollary (§4.1 in {{cite:a6384c52-2470-4bbb-93de-b2268e63dae0}}):
Corollary 3.3 
Let FORMULA  be a discrete subgroup of FORMULA . Let
FORMULA  be the union of all open domains FORMULA  in FORMULA  such
that, for any accumulation point FORMULA , with kernel FORMULA  and image FORMULA ,
of a sequence
FORMULA  with FORMULA :

When FORMULA  has balanced distortion, FORMULA  is
disjoint from the photons FORMULA  and FORMULA ;

When FORMULA  has bounded distortion, FORMULA  is
disjoint from the lightcone FORMULA ;

When FORMULA  has mixed distortion, FORMULA  is disjoint
from the photons FORMULA  and FORMULA .

Then the action of FORMULA  on FORMULA  is properly discontinuous.

Observe that the domain FORMULA  is in general bigger than the
domain FORMULA  appearing in Corollary REF . An
interesting case is that in which FORMULA  is obtained by
removing only photons:
Proposition 3.4 (Frances {{cite:a6384c52-2470-4bbb-93de-b2268e63dae0}}) 

A discrete subgroup FORMULA  of FORMULA 
does not contain sequences with bounded distortion
if and only if its action on FORMULA  is
properly discontinuous.

Frances calls such a subgroup a of the first kind.
The following suggests that the domain FORMULA  is
optimal.
Proposition 3.5 (Frances {{cite:a6384c52-2470-4bbb-93de-b2268e63dae0}}) 

Let FORMULA  be a discrete, Zariski dense subgroup of FORMULA 
which does not contain sequences with bounded distortion.
Then FORMULA  is the unique maximal open subset of FORMULA 
on which FORMULA  acts properly.


Action on  FORMULA
A similar analysis should be done when FORMULA  is considered a
discrete subgroup of FORMULA  instead of FORMULA .
The following proposition is analogous to Proposition REF :
Proposition 3.6 
Let FORMULA  be a sequence of elements of FORMULA 
with mixed distortion, such that the sequence FORMULA  converges to an endomorphism
FORMULA  of FORMULA . Then there are contact projective lines
FORMULA  and FORMULA  in FORMULA  such that, for any sequence
FORMULA 
converging to an element of
FORMULA ,
all the accumulation points of
FORMULA  belong to FORMULA .

We can then define a subset FORMULA  of FORMULA  as the interior of
the subset obtained after removing limit contact projective lines
associated to subsequences of FORMULA  with bounded or mixed
distortion, and removing projective hyperplanes associated to
subsequences with balanced distortion. Then it is easy to prove that
the action of FORMULA  on FORMULA  is properly discontinuous.
An interesting case is that in which we remove only projective lines,
and no hypersurfaces—the case in which FORMULA  has no subsequence with
balanced distortion. Frances calls such FORMULA  groups of the
second kind. The following questions arise from comparison with
Propositions REF  and REF :
Question: Can groups of the second kind be defined
as groups acting properly on some associated space?
Question: Is FORMULA  the unique maximal open
subset of FORMULA  on which the action of FORMULA  is proper, at least
if FORMULA  is Zariski dense?

Action on the flag manifold
Now consider the action of FORMULA  on the flag manifold FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be such that FORMULA , so FORMULA  and FORMULA  span a Lagrangian plane. Let

Flag2,11 Pho2,1
Flag2,12 Ein2,1
be the natural projections. Let FORMULA  be a sequence in
FORMULA  diverging to infinity with mixed distortion.
We invite the reader to verify the following statements:

 There are a flag FORMULA  and points
FORMULA  and FORMULA  such that, on the complement of
FORMULA 
the sequence FORMULA  converges
uniformly to the constant map FORMULA .

There are contact projective lines
FORMULA ,FORMULA  in FORMULA  and photons FORMULA ,FORMULA  in
FORMULA  such that, on the complement of
FORMULA 
all accumulation points of FORMULA  lie in
FORMULA 
This intersection is homeomorphic to a wedge of two circles.


Crooked surfaces
Crooked planes were introduced by Drumm {{cite:e1ef7240-aef8-4e34-a73a-fb76d1c47623}}, {{cite:f0e838ae-0405-4705-99a9-9281bee49038}}, {{cite:3a96552c-86ad-4904-944c-f942e7f419d7}} to investigate discrete groups of Lorentzian transformations which act freely and properly on FORMULA . He used crooked planes to construct
fundamental polyhedra for such actions; they play a role analogous to equidistant surfaces bounding Dirichlet fundamental domains in Hadamard manifolds. This section discusses the conformal compactification of a crooked plane and its automorphisms. 
Crooked planes in Minkowski space
For a detailed description of crooked planes, see
Drumm-Goldman {{cite:3a96552c-86ad-4904-944c-f942e7f419d7}}. We quickly summarize the basic
results here.
Consider FORMULA  with the Lorentz metric from the inner product FORMULA  on FORMULA .
A crooked plane FORMULA  is a surface in FORMULA  that divides FORMULA  into
two cells, called crooked half-spaces. It is a piecewise linear
surface composed of four 2-dimensional faces, joined along four rays,
which all meet at a point FORMULA , called the vertex.
The four rays have endpoint FORMULA , and form two lightlike geodesics,
which we denote FORMULA  and FORMULA . Two of the faces are null half-planes
FORMULA  and FORMULA , bounded by FORMULA  and FORMULA  respectively,
which we call
wings. 
The two remaining faces consist of the intersection
between FORMULA  and the timelike plane FORMULA  containing FORMULA  and FORMULA ; their union is the stem of FORMULA .
The timelike plane FORMULA  is the orthogonal complement of a unique spacelike line
FORMULA  containing FORMULA , called the spine of FORMULA .
To define a crooked plane, we first define the wings, stem, and spine. A lightlike geodesic FORMULA  lies in a unique null plane FORMULA 
(§REF ). The ambient orientation of FORMULA 
distinguishes a component of FORMULA  as follows.
Let FORMULA  be a timelike vector such that FORMULA .
Then each component of FORMULA  defined by

W+()  := { p + w (u,v,w) > 0 }
W-()  := { p + w (u,v,w) < 0 }

is independent of the choices above. In particular, every
orientation-preserving isometry FORMULA  of FORMULA  maps

W+()W+(f())
W-() W-(f())

and every orientation-reversing isometry FORMULA  maps

W+()W-(f())
W-() W+(f()) .

Given two lightlike geodesics FORMULA  containing FORMULA , the
stem is defined as
FORMULA 
The spine is
FORMULA 
Compare Drumm-Goldman {{cite:3a96552c-86ad-4904-944c-f942e7f419d7}}.
The positively-oriented crooked plane with vertex FORMULA  and stem
FORMULA  is the union

FORMULA 
Similarly, the negatively-oriented crooked plane with vertex
FORMULA  and stem FORMULA  is

FORMULA 
Given an orientation on FORMULA , a positively-oriented crooked plane is determined by its vertex and its spine. Conversely, every point FORMULA  and spacelike line FORMULA  containing FORMULA 
determines a unique positively- or negatively-oriented crooked plane.
A crooked plane FORMULA  is homeomorphic to FORMULA , and the complement
FORMULA  consists of two components, each homeomorphic
to FORMULA . The components of the complement of a crooked plane are called
open crooked half-spaces and their closures closed crooked half-spaces.
The spine of FORMULA  is the unique spacelike line contained in FORMULA .

An example
Here is an example of a crooked plane with vertex the origin and
spine the FORMULA -axis:
FORMULA 
The lightlike geodesics are
FORMULA 
the stem is
FORMULA 
and the wings are

W1  =
{ x
y
-y  :  x 0, yR}
W2  =
{ x
y
y  :  x 0, yR} .

The identity component of FORMULA  acts
transitively on the space of pairs of vertices and unit spacelike vectors,
so it is transitive on positively-oriented and negatively-oriented crooked planes.
An orientation-reversing isometry exchanges positively- and negatively-oriented crooked planes, so FORMULA  acts transitively on the set of all crooked planes.

Topology of a crooked surface
The closures of crooked planes in Minkowski patches are
crooked surfaces. These were studied in Frances {{cite:2eaf84b2-3081-438c-9356-b4fce969bd57}}.
In this section we describe the topology of a crooked surface.

Let FORMULA  be a crooked plane.
Theorem 3.1 The closure FORMULA  is a topological submanifold
homeomorphic to a Klein bottle. The lift of
FORMULA  to the double covering FORMULA  is the oriented double
covering of FORMULA  and is homeomorphic to a torus.

Since the isometry group of Minkowski space acts transitively
on crooked planes, it suffices to consider the single crooked plane FORMULA 
defined in §REF .
Recall the stratification of FORMULA  from §REF .
Write the nullcone FORMULA  of FORMULA  as
FORMULA 
The homogeneous coordinates of points in the stem FORMULA  satisfy
FORMULA 
and thus the closure of the stem FORMULA  is defined by
(homogeneous) inequalities
FORMULA 
The two lightlike geodesics
FORMULA 
defining FORMULA  extend to photons
FORMULA  with ideal points represented in homogeneous coordinates
FORMULA 
The closures of the corresponding wings FORMULA  are described in
homogeneous coordinates by:

W1 = { X
-Y
Y
U
V : X2 - U V = 0,    X V 0 }
W2 = { X
Y
Y
U
V : X2 - U V = 0,    X V 0 } .

The closure of each wing intersects the ideal lightcone
FORMULA  (described by FORMULA ) in the photons:

1 = { 0
-Y
Y
U
0 : Y,UR}
2 = { 0
Y
Y
U
0 : Y,UR} .

Thus the crooked surface FORMULA  decomposes into the following strata:

four points in a stem configuration: the vertex FORMULA , the improper point FORMULA ,
and the two ideal points FORMULA  and FORMULA ;


eight line segments, the components of

1  {p0,p1}
2  {p0,p2}
1  {p,p1}
2  {p,p2} ;

two null-half planes, the interiors of the wings FORMULA ;

the two components of the interior of the stem FORMULA .

Recall that the inversion in the unit sphere FORMULA  fixes FORMULA  and FORMULA , and interchanges
FORMULA  and FORMULA . Moreover FORMULA  interchanges
FORMULA  with FORMULA , FORMULA .
Finally FORMULA  leaves invariant the interior of each FORMULA 
and interchanges the two components of the interior of FORMULA .
The original crooked plane equals
FORMULA 
and is homeomorphic to FORMULA . The homeomorphism is depicted
schematically in Figure REF . The interiors of
FORMULA , and FORMULA  correspond to the four quadrants in FORMULA . The
wing FORMULA  is bounded by the two segments of FORMULA , whereas each
component of FORMULA  is bounded by one segment of FORMULA  and one
segment of FORMULA . These four segments correspond to the four
coordinate rays in FORMULA .
Now we can see that FORMULA  is a topological
manifold: points in
FORMULA  or
FORMULA  have coordinate neighborhoods in these
faces. Interior points of the segments have two half-disc
neighborhoods, one from a wing and one from the stem. The vertex FORMULA 
has four quarter-disc neighborhoods, one from each wing, and one from
each component of the stem. (See Figure REF .)
FIGURE 
Coordinate charts for the improper point FORMULA  and
points in FORMULA 
are obtained by composing the above charts with the inversion FORMULA .
It remains to find coordinate charts near the ideal points FORMULA .
Consider first the case of FORMULA . The linear functionals on FORMULA 
defined by

T  = Y - Z
W  = Y + Z

are null since the defining quadratic form factors:
FORMULA 
Working in the affine patch defined by FORMULA  with inhomogeneous
coordinates

 := XT
 := YT
 := WT
 := UT
 := VT

the nullcone is defined by:
FORMULA 
whence
FORMULA 
and FORMULA  is a coordinate chart for this
patch on FORMULA .
In these coordinates, FORMULA  is the origin FORMULA , FORMULA  is the line
FORMULA , and FORMULA  is the line FORMULA .
The wing FORMULA  misses this patch, but both FORMULA  and FORMULA  intersect it.
In these coordinates FORMULA  is defined by
FORMULA 
and FORMULA  is defined by
FORMULA 
Since on  FORMULA
FORMULA 
this portion of FORMULA  in this patch has two components

,< 0
,> 0

and the projection FORMULA  defines a coordinate chart
for a neighborhood of FORMULA . (Compare Figure REF .)
FIGURE 
The case of FORMULA  is completely analogous. It follows that FORMULA  is a closed surface with cell decomposition
with four 0-cells, eight 1-cells and four 2-cells. Therefore
FORMULA 
and FORMULA  is homeomorphic to either a torus or a Klein bottle.
To see that FORMULA  is nonorientable, consider a photon, for example
FORMULA . Parallel translate the null geodesic
FORMULA  to a null geodesic FORMULA  lying on the wing
FORMULA  and disjoint from FORMULA . Its closure
FORMULA  is a photon on
FORMULA  which intersects FORMULA 
transversely with intersection number 1. Thus the self-intersection number
FORMULA 
so FORMULA  is an orientation-reversing loop.
Thus FORMULA  is nonorientable, and homeomorphic to a Klein bottle.
Next we describe the stratification of a crooked surface in the double covering FORMULA . Recall from §REF  that a Minkowski patch in FORMULA  has both a spatial and a timelike improper point. Let FORMULA  be a crooked plane of FORMULA , embedded in a Minkowski patch FORMULA , so FORMULA , the timelike improper point of this patch. Denote by FORMULA  the spatial improper point.
The closure FORMULA  of FORMULA  in FORMULA  decomposes into the following strata:

seven points: FORMULA ;

twelve photon segments:

i,  connecting FORMULA  to  FORMULA
i,  connecting FORMULA  to  FORMULA
i,  connecting FORMULA  to  FORMULA ;

two null half-planes, the interiors of FORMULA  and FORMULA . The wing FORMULA  is bounded by the curves FORMULA  and FORMULA ;

the two components of the interior of the stem FORMULA . The stem is bounded by the curves FORMULA  and FORMULA , for FORMULA .

The saturation of FORMULA  by the antipodal map on FORMULA  is the lift of a crooked surface from FORMULA . The interested reader can verify that it is homeomorphic to a torus.

Automorphisms of a crooked surface
Let FORMULA  be the positively-oriented crooked plane of Section REF , and FORMULA  the associated crooked surface in FORMULA . First, FORMULA  is invariant by all positive homotheties centered at the origin, because each of the wings and the stem are. Second, it is invariant by the 1-dimensional group of linear hyperbolic isometries of Minkowski space preserving the lightlike lines bounding the stem. The subgroup FORMULA , which can be viewed as the subgroup of FORMULA  acting by positive homotheties and positive linear hyperbolic isometries of Minkowski space, then preserves FORMULA , and hence FORMULA . The element
FORMULA 
is a reflection in the spine, and also preserves FORMULA . Note that FORMULA  is time-reversing. Then we have
FORMULA 
Next let FORMULA  be the two lightlike geodesics bounding the stem (alternatively bounding the wings) of FORMULA . As above, the inversion FORMULA  leaves invariant FORMULA . In fact, the element
FORMULA 
is an automorphism of FORMULA . The involution
FORMULA 
also preserves FORMULA  and exchanges the ideal points FORMULA  and FORMULA . The involutions FORMULA  and FORMULA  pairwise commute, and each product is also an involution, so we have
FORMULA 
To any crooked surface can be associated a quadruple of points in a stem configuration.  The stabilizer of a stem configuration in FORMULA  is FORMULA , the normalizer of a Cartan subgroup FORMULA . Suppose that the points FORMULA  are associated to FORMULA . As above, a neighborhood of FORMULA  in FORMULA  is not diffeomorphic to a neighborhood of FORMULA  in FORMULA , so any automorphism must in fact belong to the subgroup FORMULA  preserving each pair FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Each FORMULA  either preserves FORMULA  or carries it to its opposite, the closure of the negatively-oriented crooked plane having the same vertex and spine as FORMULA .
Now it is not hard to verify that the full automorphism group of FORMULA  in FORMULA  is FORMULA .

Construction of discrete groups
A complete flat Lorentzian manifold is a quotient FORMULA ,
where FORMULA  acts freely and properly discontinuously
on FORMULA .
When FORMULA , Fried and Goldman {{cite:ee9b4d1b-86d6-4be6-8354-9880c0f4b71f}}
showed that unless FORMULA  is solvable,
projection on FORMULA  is necessarily injective and,
furthermore, this linear part is a discrete subgroup
 FORMULA{{cite:073b332c-1b52-4f78-a74c-1ead425efe63}}, {{cite:4732a57d-42cb-46ff-aa70-e8f2279f3e37}}, {{cite:7a371506-a606-4320-a0ba-cb326759c4b9}}.
In this section we identify FORMULA  with its usual embedding in FORMULA , so that we consider such FORMULA  as discrete subgroups of FORMULA . We will look at the resulting actions on Einstein space, as well as on photon space. At the end of the section, we list some open questions.
Spine reflections
In §REF , we described the automorphism group of a crooked surface. We recall some of the basic facts about the reflection in the spine of a crooked surface, which is discussed in §REF  and §REF , and which is denoted FORMULA  in the example above. Take the inner product on FORMULA 
to be given by the matrix
FORMULA 
and identify FORMULA  with its usual embedding in the Minkowski patch determined by the improper point FORMULA . Let FORMULA  be the crooked plane determined by the stem configuration FORMULA  as in §REF , with
FORMULA 
Then FORMULA 
is an orientation-preserving,
time-reversing involution having fixed set
FORMULA 
In the Minkowski patch,
FORMULA  interchanges the two components
of the complement of FORMULA .
If a set of crooked planes in FORMULA  is pairwise disjoint, then the group generated by reflections in their spines acts properly discontinuously on the entire space {{cite:25f64445-a040-4c3b-9afc-a3cb9b736001}}, {{cite:e1ef7240-aef8-4e34-a73a-fb76d1c47623}}, {{cite:3a96552c-86ad-4904-944c-f942e7f419d7}}. Thus spine reflections associated to disjoint crooked planes give rise to discrete subgroups of FORMULA . We will outline a way to construct such groups; see {{cite:d08c8892-2a41-4a5c-8400-0fb6a3f812f0}}, for details.
Let FORMULA  be a pair of spacelike circles that intersect in a point; conjugating if necessary, we may assume that this point is FORMULA . Each circle FORMULA , FORMULA , is the projectivized nullcone of a subspace FORMULA  of type (2,1); FORMULA  can be written as the direct sum
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  are spacelike vectors and FORMULA  is of type (1,1). We call FORMULA  an ultraparallel pair if FORMULA  is spacelike. Alternatively, we can define the pair to be ultraparallel if they are parallel to vectors FORMULA  such that FORMULA 
is a spacelike line in FORMULA .
Let FORMULA , FORMULA  be an ultraparallel pair of spacelike circles in FORMULA . Denote by FORMULA  and FORMULA  the spine reflections fixing the respective circles. (Note that FORMULA  and FORMULA  are conjugate to FORMULA , since FORMULA  acts transitively on crooked surfaces.) Identifying the subgroup of FORMULA  fixing FORMULA  and
FORMULA  with the group of Lorentzian linear similarities
FORMULA 
then FORMULA  has hyperbolic linear part—that is, it has three, distinct real eigenvalues. The proof of this fact and the following proposition may be found, for instance, in {{cite:d08c8892-2a41-4a5c-8400-0fb6a3f812f0}}.
Proposition 1.1 Let FORMULA  and FORMULA  be an ultraparallel pair of spacelike circles as above. Then FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the spines of a pair of disjoint crooked planes, bounding a fundamental domain for FORMULA  in FORMULA .

Note that while FORMULA  acts freely and properly discontinuously on FORMULA , it fixes FORMULA  as well as two points on the ideal circle.
Next, let FORMULA , FORMULA  be a triple of pairwise ultraparallel spacelike circles, all intersecting in FORMULA , and let FORMULA  be the associated group of spine reflections. Then FORMULA  contains an index-two free group generated by hyperbolic isometries of FORMULA  (see {{cite:d08c8892-2a41-4a5c-8400-0fb6a3f812f0}}). Conversely, we have the following generalization of a well-known theorem in hyperbolic geometry.
Theorem 1.2 {{cite:d08c8892-2a41-4a5c-8400-0fb6a3f812f0}}
Let FORMULA  be a subgroup of isometries of FORMULA , where each FORMULA  has hyperbolic linear part and such that their invariant lines are pairwise ultraparallel. Then there exist spine reflections FORMULA , FORMULA , such that FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA .

Note that FORMULA  as above is discrete. Indeed, viewed as a group of affine isometries of FORMULA , its linear part FORMULA  acts on the hyperbolic plane and is generated by reflections in three ultraparallel lines.
As mentioned before, if the spacelike circles are spines of pairwise disjoint crooked planes, then FORMULA  acts properly discontinuously on the Minkowski patch. Applying this strategy, we obtain that the set of all properly discontinuous groups FORMULA , with linear part generated by three ultraparallel reflections, is non-empty and open {{cite:d08c8892-2a41-4a5c-8400-0fb6a3f812f0}}.
Here is an example. For FORMULA , let FORMULA  be the FORMULA -subspace
FORMULA 
where

u1 =  2  0  1 u2 =  -22  62  1 u3 =  -22  -62  1 
p1 =  0  2  1 p2 =  -62  -22  1 p3 =  62   -22  1.

Then the projectivized nullcone of FORMULA  is a spacelike circle—in fact, it corresponds to the spacelike geodesic in FORMULA  passing through FORMULA  and parallel to FORMULA . The crooked planes with vertex FORMULA  and spine FORMULA , respectively, are pairwise disjoint (one shows this using inequalities found in {{cite:3a96552c-86ad-4904-944c-f942e7f419d7}}).

Actions on photon space
Still in the same Minkowski patch as above, let FORMULA  be a finitely generated discrete subgroup of FORMULA  that is free and purely hyperbolic—that is, every nontrivial element is hyperbolic. Considered as a group of isometries of the hyperbolic plane, FORMULA  is a convex cocompact free group. By Barbot {{cite:7bf037d4-e4d9-4a57-9c52-dec7d913768f}},
Theorem 2.1 
Let FORMULA  be a subgroup of isometries of FORMULA  with convex cocompact linear part. Then there is a pair of non-empty, FORMULA -invariant, open, convex sets FORMULA  such that

The action of FORMULA  on FORMULA  is free and proper;

The quotient spaces FORMULA  are globally hyperbolic;

Each FORMULA  is maximal among connected open domains satisfying these two properties;

The only open domains satisfying all three properties above are FORMULA .


The notion of global hyperbolicity is central in
General Relativity, see for example {{cite:29fc55eb-b005-4543-8ad4-1929bb62548a}}. The global hyperbolicity
of FORMULA  implies that it is
homeomorphic to the product FORMULA . It also implies that no element of FORMULA  preserves a null ray in
FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be as in Theorem REF  and consider its action, for instance, on FORMULA . Since FORMULA  is globally hyperbolic, it admits a Cauchy hypersurface, a spacelike surface FORMULA  which meets every complete causal curve and with complement consisting of two connected components. The universal covering FORMULA  is
FORMULA -invariant.
The subset FORMULA  comprising photons which
intersect FORMULA  is open.
We claim that FORMULA  acts freely and properly on
FORMULA . Indeed, let FORMULA  be a compact set. Then FORMULA  is
contained in a product of compact subsets FORMULA , where
FORMULA  and FORMULA , the set of photon directions.
The action of FORMULA  restricts to a Riemannian action on FORMULA .
Thus the set
FORMULA 
is finite. As FORMULA  is spacelike, it follows that
FORMULA  is finite
too. Finally, global hyperbolicity of FORMULA  implies
that no photon intersecting FORMULA  is
invariant under the action of any element of FORMULA .
Corollary 2.2 There exists a non-empty open subset of FORMULA  on which
FORMULA  acts freely and properly discontinuously.


Some questions
So far we have considered groups of transformations of FORMULA  and FORMULA  arising from discrete groups of Minkowski isometries. Specifically, we have focused on groups generated by spine reflections associated to spacelike circles intersecting in a point.
Question: Describe the action on FORMULA  of a group generated by spine reflections corresponding to non-intersecting spacelike circles. In particular, determine the possible dynamics of such an action.
A related question is:
Question: What does a crooked surface look like when its spine does not pass through FORMULA , or the lightcone at infinity altogether? Describe the action of the associated group of spine reflections.
More generally, we may wish to consider other involutions in the automorphism group of a crooked surface.
Question: Describe the action on FORMULA  of a group generated by involutions, in terms of their associated crooked surfaces.
As for the action on photon space, here is a companion question to those asked in §:
