Covers of Elliptic Curves and the Lower Bound for Slopes of Effective Divisors on  FORMULADawei ChenConsider genus FORMULA  curves that admit degree FORMULA  covers to elliptic
curves only branched at one point with a fixed ramification type.
The locus of such covers forms a one parameter family FORMULA  that
naturally maps into the moduli space of stable genus FORMULA  curves
FORMULA . We study the geometry of FORMULA , and
produce a combinatorial method by which to investigate its slope,
irreducible components, genus and orbifold points. As a by-product
of our approach, we find some equalities from classical number
theory. Moreover, a correspondence between our method and the
viewpoint of square-tiled surfaces is established. We also use our
results to study the lower bound for slopes of effective divisors
on FORMULA .

Introduction
Let FORMULA  denote the Deligne-Mumford moduli
space of genus FORMULA  stable curves. Our aim is to study the
effective cone of FORMULA . Recall that FORMULA 
is generated by the Hodge class FORMULA  and boundary classes
FORMULA  The
study of effective divisors on FORMULA  has a
long history dating back to {{cite:1001bd5a-125c-41cf-a910-d066932210a1}}, {{cite:e80a6a3b-02df-4fd6-be44-331cc243c1ac}} and {{cite:5cad1623-0603-4371-8c68-fd9c05eceb9e}}.
The most important result in this circle of ideas is the
following.
Theorem 1.1 FORMULA  is of general type when FORMULA .

The idea of the proof is to write the canonical divisor in the
form FORMULA , where FORMULA  and FORMULA 
are ample and effective FORMULA -divisors respectively. Then
FORMULA  is big and FORMULA  is of general type. In
practice, we know that FORMULA  and FORMULA  is ample for
FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the total boundary. So as
long as we obtain an effective divisor FORMULA  with FORMULA  for all FORMULA  and
FORMULA , then
we can write FORMULA  in the desired form
FORMULA . Define the number
FORMULA  to be the slope FORMULA  of the divisor FORMULA . Then the remaining task is to
find effective divisors with small slope.
In {{cite:5cad1623-0603-4371-8c68-fd9c05eceb9e}}, the famous Brill-Noether divisor was shown to do the trick. Recall that when the Brill-Noether number FORMULA  is equal to FORMULA , the Brill-Noether divisor FORMULA  consists of genus FORMULA  curves which possess a FORMULA . Amazingly, FORMULA , the so-called Brill-Noether bound, is independent of FORMULA , and is less than FORMULA  if FORMULA . For almost
20 years after the publication of {{cite:5cad1623-0603-4371-8c68-fd9c05eceb9e}}, no one succeeded in finding any effective divisor of slope lower than the Brill-Noether bound.
This led to the formulation, in {{cite:84bff619-2659-44fe-824a-7b6ec2c1af97}}, of the following slope
conjecture.
Conjecture 1.2 The Brill-Noether bound FORMULA  provides a lower bound for slopes of effective divisors on FORMULA . The bound is sharp if and only if FORMULA  is composite.

Unfortunately, the slope conjecture is false. In {{cite:a9894670-20c1-491d-8c12-bb3c2719310f}}, Farkas
and Popa study genus 10 curves contained in FORMULA  surfaces, or
equivalently curves embedded in FORMULA  by FORMULA 's
whose images are contained in quadric threefolds. These curves
sweep out a divisor FORMULA  in FORMULA .
Surprisingly, FORMULA , which is less than the
Brill-Noether bound FORMULA . So FORMULA  serves as a first counterexample to the slope conjecture.
Recently, in {{cite:aa5a530a-3868-4438-808b-7ea5207edf6f}}, {{cite:9aff9adf-d131-40aa-ad8c-df1d202bd8e8}},
{{cite:51af7d1a-075f-4e72-87b0-4d3b2a48eaf1}} and {{cite:98e0942d-823e-4115-b74b-9dcc345c7c6e}}, more counterexamples are constructed, and in these papers Farkas also announces that FORMULA  and FORMULA  are of general type.
The above results only tell us one side of the story, where slopes
of effective divisors are concerned. On the other side, to the
best of the author's knowledge, all effective divisors that have
been studied thus far have slope greater than 6. So in some sense,
the slope conjecture is not far from the truth. A natural question
is to ask:
Question 1.3 Is there a lower bound for slopes of effective divisors on
FORMULA ?

A uniform lower bound FORMULA  for all FORMULA  would enable us to solve the Schottky problem, which roughly says that the modular forms of slope FORMULA  cut out FORMULA  in FORMULA , the moduli space for abelian varieties of dimension FORMULA , see, e.g., {{cite:babecde7-5c5b-4f2b-8247-6ad6de5502ba}}.
The idea to obtain a lower bound is to construct moving curves in
FORMULA . An irreducible curve FORMULA  is called a moving curve if the family
of its deformations fills in a Zariski open set of
FORMULA . We can define the slope of FORMULA  by
FORMULA . If
an effective divisor FORMULA  does not contain FORMULA , then FORMULA  and FORMULA  Hence, the smallest slope of curves in
this family bounds the slope of effective divisors, since a
divisor cannot contain all the deformations of a moving curve!
Along these lines, in {{cite:84bff619-2659-44fe-824a-7b6ec2c1af97}}, Harris and Morrison study genus
FORMULA  curves as degree FORMULA  covers of FORMULA  for large FORMULA .
If we vary the branch points in FORMULA , we just obtain
moving curves in FORMULA . The slopes of such
moving curves do provide good lower bounds when FORMULA  is small.
However, as FORMULA , these bounds tend to 0.
Therefore, the existence of a uniform positive lower bound for the slope for all FORMULA  remains unknown.
The same circle of ideas is mentioned in {{cite:52d207a7-4343-4d85-afc2-d118b2827e13}}. Instead of
using covers of FORMULA , Coskun, Harris and Starr choose
canonical curves in FORMULA  to study. In order to get
moving curves in FORMULA , they impose on
canonical curves some conditions like contacting fixed linear
subspaces with suitable orders. This method works pretty well for
genus up to 6. But the general case is hard to analyze since we do
not have good knowledge about the geometry of canonical curves and
the Gromov-Witten theory for high genus curves is far from complete.
Here we push the idea in {{cite:84bff619-2659-44fe-824a-7b6ec2c1af97}} further to consider covers of
elliptic curves. Take a cover FORMULA  that only has
one branch point at the marked point FORMULA  of the elliptic curve
FORMULA . If we vary the complex structure of FORMULA , FORMULA  also varies and
its locus in FORMULA  forms a 1-dimensional
subscheme FORMULA . The geometry of FORMULA  is our main interest.
We need to do three things as follows.
Firstly, we want to calculate the slope of FORMULA . Here we use a very
classical approach originally due to Hurwitz. He used
symmetric groups to enumerate covers of FORMULA 
Similarly, the information of a degree FORMULA  branched cover of an
elliptic curve can be encoded in a certain equivalence class of
solution pairs in FORMULA . We fix the ramification type of the
cover by a conjugacy class FORMULA  in
FORMULA , i.e.,
FORMULA . Let
FORMULA  also denote a conjugacy
class of FORMULA  whose number of length FORMULA  cycles equals FORMULA ,
FORMULA . For two pairs FORMULA , we define an
equivalence relation by FORMULA 
if there exists an element FORMULA  such that FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Moreover, let FORMULA  denote the subgroup of FORMULA 
generated by FORMULA  and FORMULA . Define a set
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
and its subset
FORMULA 
based on the
conjugacy type of FORMULA . Then the cover FORMULA  corresponds to one
equivalence class of solution pairs in FORMULA . Readers should bear in mind that for this cover,
FORMULA  correspond to the monodromy images of a standard symplectic basis of FORMULA . Pick a loop FORMULA  around the branched point FORMULA . The monodromy image of FORMULA  has to be an element
in the ramification class FORMULA . The transitivity condition imposed on FORMULA  is because we want the cover to be connected. See the following picture.
FIGURE 
Let FORMULA  denote the order of the
set FORMULA 
modulo the equivalence relation, i.e.,
FORMULA 
When there is no ambiguity, we simply use FORMULA  to denote FORMULA .
Let us further define a total sum
FORMULA 
and a weighted sum
FORMULA 
It is clear that FORMULA  and FORMULA  only depend on FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Now we can state the main result about the slope of FORMULA .
Theorem 1.4
FORMULA 

Remark 1.5 Note that FORMULA  only depends on the ratio
FORMULA .

Secondly, we have to study the irreducible components of FORMULA . By
using the symmetric group FORMULA  again, we can see that two
covers lie in the same component of FORMULA  if and only if the
solution pair corresponding to one can be sent to the solution
pair corresponding to the other via a monodromy action. More
precisely, define two actions FORMULA  and FORMULA  acting on the set FORMULA . It is not hard to
check that both actions are well defined for FORMULA . Let FORMULA 
denote the group of actions generated by FORMULA  and call FORMULA  the
monodromy group of FORMULA . We give the following criterion.
Theorem 1.6  Take two covers represented by two solution
pairs FORMULA  and FORMULA  in FORMULA . Then
the points in FORMULA  corresponding to these two covers are contained in
the same component of FORMULA  if and only if there exists an element
in the monodromy group FORMULA  that sends FORMULA  to
FORMULA .

Finally, we have to verify whether or not FORMULA  is a moving
curve in FORMULA . Readers may already be aware
of the fact that FORMULA  is more likely rigid, since a cover
corresponding to a point in FORMULA  only has one branched point, whose
variation along the target elliptic curve does not change the
moduli of this elliptic curve. Nevertheless, technically we do not
need moving curves. Instead, when the degree FORMULA  of the
covers varies, as long as the union of all FORMULA  is
Zariski dense in FORMULA , an effective divisor
cannot contain all of them. So the smallest slope
FORMULA  in this union still provides a lower bound for
slopes of effective divisors. Luckily, for ramification class
FORMULA  of suitable types, we have an affirmative answer to this
density problem.
Theorem 1.7  When FORMULA  and FORMULA  are
fixed but FORMULA  varies, the image of the union of FORMULA  is dense in
FORMULA  if and only if the number of
ramification points is less than FORMULA , i.e., FORMULA .

We apply the above results to the case FORMULA . About the slope, we
have the following conclusion.
Theorem 1.8  When FORMULA , FORMULA  can be either of type
FORMULA  or of type FORMULA . In both cases FORMULA 
has constant slope FORMULA  independent of FORMULA .

Note that 10 is the sharp lower bound for slopes of effective
divisors on FORMULA , cf. Remark REF . We
will give a direct proof of Theorem REF  in section 4 but
only for prime number FORMULA . The general case follows from an
indirect argument in Remark REF .
We can further calculate the genus of FORMULA . The following results
are only for prime FORMULA .
Theorem 1.9  When FORMULA , FORMULA  is prime and FORMULA  is of type
FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  denotes the greatest common
divisor of FORMULA  and FORMULA . In particular, asymptotically FORMULA .

Theorem 1.10  When FORMULA , FORMULA  is prime and FORMULA  is of type
FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
In particular, asymptotically FORMULA .

Theorems REF  and REF  will be proved in section 5 by considering local monodromy actions.
When FORMULA  is 3, the combinatorics becomes harder. However, we check
one case by computers: when FORMULA  is of type FORMULA 
and FORMULA  is prime, it looks like that FORMULA  tends to 9, cf.
Conjecture REF . Note that 9 is the sharp lower bound for
slopes of effective divisors on FORMULA , cf. {{cite:84bff619-2659-44fe-824a-7b6ec2c1af97}}.
Unfortunately, although in principle by Theorems REF  and REF  we know almost everything about FORMULA ,
in practice it seems that the combinatorial problems we encounter are quite complicated, especially when FORMULA  is large. It would be very interesting to obtain
more numerical evidences to see if this method does provide a lower bound for slopes of effective divisors.
This paper is organized in the following way. In section 2 we
study the geometry of FORMULA , namely we consider slope, monodromy and density.
Then we apply the results to the genus 2 case and several examples of the genus 3 case in section 3. In section 4,
a general method is introduced to express FORMULA  and FORMULA  in terms of some generating functions.
Then we study the genus and orbifold points of FORMULA  in section 5.
Afterwards, a correspondence between our viewpoint and the viewpoint of square-tiled surfaces is established in section 6. Finally in the appendix,
we prove some equalities of certain series appearing in section 5 by a trick of classical number theory.

The Global Geometry of  FORMULA
In this section, we will focus on the slope, monodromy and density
of FORMULA  and prove Theorems REF , REF  and
REF  one by one. First, let us give a rigorous construction of FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  parameterize a general pencil of plane
cubics. Blow up the 9 base points to obtain a smooth surface FORMULA 
that is an elliptic fibration over FORMULA . There are 12 rational
nodal curves as special fibers over FORMULA .
Fix a section FORMULA  corresponding to the blow up of one of the
9 base points. With this section, FORMULA  can be considered as a
12-sheeted cover of the moduli space of elliptic curves
FORMULA . Take a general fiber FORMULA  over
FORMULA . Consider all the possible degree FORMULA  covers FORMULA  from a genus FORMULA  connected curves FORMULA  to FORMULA 
branched only at FORMULA . Let FORMULA , where FORMULA  is a fixed conjugacy
class FORMULA  of the symmetric group FORMULA . When FORMULA  varies in
FORMULA , the locus of such
covers also varies in a 1-dimensional Hurwitz scheme
FORMULA . Now, if FORMULA  approaches some point FORMULA ,
the cover degenerates to a cover of a rational nodal curve, in the
sense of admissible covers. Hence, we can compactify FORMULA  by the space of
admissible covers FORMULA . When
there is no ambiguity, we will simply use FORMULA  and FORMULA  instead.
The curve FORMULA  is an FORMULA -sheeted cover of FORMULA , possibly branched at
FORMULA . FORMULA  is equal to the number of distinct
genus FORMULA  degree FORMULA  covers of a general plane cubic only branched
at one point of ramification type FORMULA . Note that this number
FORMULA  equals the total sum
FORMULA 
defined in the
introduction section.
Slope
There is a natural map from the space of admissible covers FORMULA  to
FORMULA . So it makes sense to talk about the
intersections FORMULA  and FORMULA  by pulling
back the corresponding classes to FORMULA . Now we can prove
Theorem REF .
 We have to figure out the two numbers FORMULA  and FORMULA . The former can be worked out by the
following argument. We want to establish a diagram of maps:
FORMULA 
such that over a point FORMULA  mapping
to FORMULA , the fiber over FORMULA  is the corresponding cover of the
fiber over FORMULA , i.e., T is the universal covering curve over FORMULA . See the picture below.
FIGURE 
When FORMULA 
is in FORMULA , locally we can always construct FORMULA . Now in a small
neighborhood of FORMULA , we can identify all the smooth fibers to
a fixed elliptic curve FORMULA . Let FORMULA  be a standard symplectic
basis of FORMULA  such that FORMULA  is the vanishing cycle
when the smooth elliptic curve degenerates to the rational nodal
curve over FORMULA . We abuse notation and denote their monodromy
images in FORMULA  also by FORMULA , and assume FORMULA . Now the key observation is
that when the elliptic curve degenerates, the combinatorial type of the solution pair corresponding
to the smooth cover determines the type of the degenerate cover.
More precisely, the degenerate covering curve will have FORMULA 
nodes at which the map FORMULA  is given locally by FORMULA , where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the
local charts of FORMULA  and FORMULA  respectively. Each such node
contributes FORMULA  to the intersection
FORMULA . Therefore, we have
FORMULA 
The constant 12 comes from the number of singular fibers of FORMULA .
To calculate FORMULA , by Mumford's formula FORMULA , it suffices to work
out the intersection FORMULA . The
ramification class FORMULA  is of type FORMULA  so
we have FORMULA  sections FORMULA  of FORMULA  such
that FORMULA . By Riemann-Hurwitz,
the relative dualizing sheaves FORMULA  and FORMULA 
satisfy the relation
FORMULA 
Moreover,
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
So we get
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
Now it is routine
to check that
FORMULA 
So we
get the desired formula for FORMULA .
Remark 2.1  To complete the commutative diagram in the above proof,
when the map is given locally by FORMULA  where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the local
charts of FORMULA  and FORMULA  respectively, a base change of degree
divisible by FORMULA  is necessary. So we can make a degree FORMULA  base
change once for all to realize such maps globally. After the base
change, FORMULA  and FORMULA  both have to be
multiplied by FORMULA , so the quotient FORMULA  remains the same.
A fancier interpretation is that by using a minimal base change,
we pass from the space of admissible covers FORMULA  to the stack of
admissible covers FORMULA  where a universal covering map
lives. This viewpoint is crucial when we study the local geometry
of FORMULA  in section 5.

Remark 2.2  Recall that in our original definition of a cover and
its automorphism, we did not allow variation of the target
elliptic curve. So an automorphism of a cover FORMULA  is given by the following commutative diagram,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is an automorphism of FORMULA .
However, the elliptic curve FORMULA  always has an automorphism induced
by its involution FORMULA  that sends FORMULA  to
FORMULA . If we further identify the two
solution pairs FORMULA , that
is, we allow the following commutative diagram to be considered as
an automorphism of the cover FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
we would get a new space FORMULA . FORMULA  can
be viewed as a double cover of FORMULA . More precisely, for a
component FORMULA  of FORMULA , if a general cover in FORMULA  corresponding to a
solution pair FORMULA  does not have the automorphism
induced by FORMULA , i.e., there does not exist an element FORMULA  such that
FORMULA ,
then FORMULA  is a double cover of the corresponding component FORMULA  of
FORMULA . On the other hand, if there is some FORMULA  such
that
FORMULA ,
then every cover in FORMULA  has the automorphism induced by FORMULA .
Hence, FORMULA  is a double curve and its reduced structure is the same
as FORMULA . Note for the purpose of slope calculation that FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are always the same.


Monodromy
The curve FORMULA  may be reducible. Actually if two pairs
FORMULA  and FORMULA  generate non-conjugate
subgroups of FORMULA , then the corresponding two covers must
be contained in different components of FORMULA .
Now let us consider the monodromy of the map FORMULA .
More precisely, we want to study the FORMULA -monodromy map
FORMULA , where FORMULA 
is a fixed base point of FORMULA , FORMULA  is the fiber over FORMULA 
with one marked point and FORMULA  is the
orientable outer automorphism group.
Lemma 2.3 The map FORMULA  is surjective and its image FORMULA . Moreover, the group FORMULA  of
FORMULA -monodromy acting on FORMULA  can be generated by two
operations: FORMULA 
and FORMULA .

We give an indirect proof using the fact that the
FORMULA -monodromy map FORMULA  of a general pencil of plane
cubics is
surjective.
For FORMULA -monodromy, the marked point does not affect homology.
So we consider the map FORMULA . In order to show that FORMULA  is surjective
for a general pencil FORMULA , it suffices to exhibit a special pencil
for which the claim holds. Actually some examples are explicitly
worked out in {{cite:771f58a0-c40f-4e9f-90a3-c1355bfeae61}} and the FORMULA -monodromy maps are
surjective as we expect.
Now for FORMULA -monodromy, we can construct the following
commutative diagram:
FORMULA 
Here FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the mapping class groups
for an ordinary torus and a torus with one marked point
respectively. It is well known that FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are both isomorphic to
FORMULA . The map FORMULA  is induced by quotienting out
commutators, i.e., FORMULA , where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the
generators of the free group FORMULA . Moreover, we
have the isomorphism
FORMULA , cf.
{{cite:9e621e49-d201-4b69-b578-b1a8e3b96f77}}.
So the conclusion that FORMULA  is surjective follows from the fact that FORMULA  is surjective.
Finally, FORMULA  is generated by the two
basic actions induced from Dehn twists along the two loops
represented by FORMULA  and FORMULA . So correspondingly the
monodromy actions send FORMULA  to FORMULA  and FORMULA  respectively.
Now Theorem REF  follows easily from the above lemma.
Remark 2.4 Since FORMULA , the
monodromy actions are well defined up to the equivalence relation.
The two actions FORMULA  and FORMULA  correspond to FORMULA  and FORMULA  respectively, which generate
FORMULA .

Remark 2.5 
Assume that FORMULA  corresponds to the local vanishing cycle around a nodal fiber over
FORMULA . By the Picard-Lefschetz formula or Kodaira's classification of elliptic fibrations, going along a small loop around FORMULA  once will send a solution pair FORMULA  to FORMULA . See the following picture.
FIGURE 
We call this action as the local monodromy action, in order to distinguish it from the global monodromy.
It is useful when we study the genus of FORMULA  by applying the Riemann-Hurwitz formula to the map FORMULA ,
cf. section 5.


Density
In this section, whenever we mention density, we mean Zariski
density. Notation is the same as before. Let FORMULA  be the
conjugacy class FORMULA  of FORMULA . We assume that
FORMULA  are greater than 1 and that the rest of the
FORMULA 's are all equal to 1. By Riemann-Hurwitz, FORMULA .
Now the pullback of a holomorphic 1-form from the target elliptic
curve becomes a holomorphic 1-form FORMULA  on the covering curve
FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
where FORMULA  and
FORMULA . So we can fix the
ramification type by fixing FORMULA  but adding more
length-1 cycles to FORMULA . Hence, the degree FORMULA 
of the map can vary from FORMULA  to infinity.
Now we consider the union of all possible covers in the above
sense. An equivalent statement of Theorem REF  is the
following.
Theorem 2.6 
The image of FORMULA  is dense
in FORMULA  if and only if the inequality
FORMULA  holds, i.e., FORMULA .

Let FORMULA  be a partition of FORMULA . We
consider the moduli space FORMULA  parameterizing
FORMULA  where FORMULA ,
FORMULA , and
FORMULA . The
dimension of FORMULA  is
FORMULA 
The space
FORMULA  can locally be equipped with a coordinate system. Pick a
basis FORMULA  the relative homology of
FORMULA  with FORMULA  marked points, such that
FORMULA  are the standard symplectic basis
of FORMULA  and FORMULA  is a path connecting
FORMULA  and FORMULA , FORMULA . The period map
FORMULA  is given by
FORMULA 
which provides a local coordinate system for FORMULA , cf. {{cite:1408a4b9-a2b0-48bf-8ab8-bea0e5e11710}}.
Now pick a torus FORMULA  given by FORMULA , where FORMULA  is a lattice. Consider the coordinate FORMULA . We
cite the following lemma from {{cite:a7c3d940-feb8-4510-af22-298bbc3f661f}}.
Lemma 2.7 FORMULA  if and only if the following conditions
hold:
(1) there exists a holomorphic map FORMULA ;
(2)
FORMULA ;
(3) FORMULA  is ramified at FORMULA  with
ramification order FORMULA , FORMULA ;
(4)
FORMULA  mod FORMULA , FORMULA .

By virtue of this lemma, if we want to get a cover FORMULA  branched at one point with ramification type FORMULA , it is equivalent to FORMULA  mod FORMULA ,
FORMULA . Now we vary FORMULA  and such lattice points FORMULA 
are dense in an open domain of FORMULA . Let FORMULA  be the
union of such coverings FORMULA , so FORMULA 
is dense in FORMULA . Now we have the following diagram:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the Hodge bundle
over FORMULA . As long as FORMULA  dominates
FORMULA , i.e., for a general FORMULA 
there exists FORMULA  such that FORMULA , then Im
FORMULA 
must be dense in FORMULA . Now we have to check that when
FORMULA , i.e., FORMULA , FORMULA  does dominate FORMULA .
The case FORMULA  can be reduced to FORMULA  since there is a
natural stratification among all the moduli spaces FORMULA . When FORMULA , we apply the De Jonquières' Formula
from {{cite:2f14b614-be8e-4ed3-aeec-b67cf15873a4}}. Suppose that FORMULA 
are distinct integers and FORMULA  appears FORMULA  times in the
partition FORMULA  of FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA 
Further define FORMULA  and
FORMULA . Then on a genus
FORMULA  curve, the virtual number of canonical divisors having FORMULA 
points of multiplicity FORMULA  is
FORMULA 
As long as this number is nonzero,
FORMULA  dominates FORMULA . Let FORMULA  and FORMULA . Then
FORMULA 
since FORMULA  has nonnegative coefficients and FORMULA  has positive coefficients.
Remark 2.8 The most general case is FORMULA ;
then we want to analyze FORMULA . Of course in this case the image of
FORMULA  is
dense in FORMULA . The most special case is FORMULA ; then correspondingly
FORMULA .
Obviously for dimension reasons, the image of
FORMULA  has
to be contained in a proper subvariety of FORMULA .

Since the slope formula and the monodromy of FORMULA  are relatively
simple to analyze when FORMULA  is prime, from now on we will mainly
focus on FORMULA  prime for concrete examples. Therefore, the following
result is also useful.
Claim 2.9 The image of FORMULA 
is dense in FORMULA  if and only if the inequality FORMULA  holds, i.e., FORMULA .

We illustrate the idea of the proof. Use the notation in the proof
of Theorem REF  and write the coordinate FORMULA . The degree FORMULA  of the map from FORMULA  to a
standard torus FORMULA  equals the area of FORMULA , which is given by
FORMULA 
Now consider all
the integer valued vectors FORMULA  such that FORMULA  is some
prime number FORMULA . The above claim is equivalent to the density in
FORMULA  of their union. Note for a fixed prime FORMULA  that
such integer points are always dense in the corresponding
hypersurface. Since there are infinitely many such hypersurfaces,
the result immediately follows.

Examples of Slope Calculation
In this section, we introduce one ad hoc method to calculate
FORMULA  for small FORMULA . For
simplicity, we only deal with the case when FORMULA  is prime. It will
become clear that the method can also be used for
general FORMULA  but with more subtle analysis.
First, let us reduce the problem a little bit by getting rid of
the equivalence relation. As introduced before,
FORMULA .
FORMULA  acts on FORMULA  by conjugation. Burnside's lemma tells us that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .
Lemma 3.1 
If FORMULA  commutes with all the elements in a transitive subgroup
FORMULA  of FORMULA , then FORMULA  must be of type FORMULA  in FORMULA ,
lm=d.

It suffices to show that for any FORMULA , if FORMULA 
fixes an element in FORMULA , then FORMULA .
Suppose FORMULA . For any FORMULA , there exists FORMULA , such
that FORMULA . But FORMULA  also commutes with FORMULA . By
FORMULA , we know that FORMULA , so
FORMULA .
When FORMULA  is prime, the above FORMULA  must be either FORMULA  or the
long cycle class FORMULA . Pick a long cycle FORMULA ,
i.e., FORMULA  is sent to FORMULA . By Burnside's lemma, we have
FORMULA 
Lemma 3.2 
FORMULA .

We know that FORMULA , so FORMULA , where FORMULA  is an integer independent of FORMULA .
Similarly FORMULA , and FORMULA  is
independent of FORMULA . Now it is easy to check that
FORMULA , so there is no solution
pair in FORMULA .
Hence, finally we obtain the relation:
FORMULA 
 FORMULA
We want to find solution pairs FORMULA  such that FORMULA  and FORMULA  is transitive. Let FORMULA  satisfying the equality
FORMULA .
Now the key point is, FORMULA  and FORMULA  are in
the same conjugacy class, so FORMULA . Note that
FORMULA  cannot be contained in three different cycles of
FORMULA , since FORMULA  changes the conjugacy type of FORMULA . So only two cases are possible:
(1) FORMULA ;
(2) FORMULA .
Using also the condition that FORMULA  is transitive, in
case (1) FORMULA  must be of type FORMULA , so FORMULA  can only be
the long cycle FORMULA . Pick an element FORMULA .
There are FORMULA  choices for the cycle
FORMULA ; fix one. Now for FORMULA , we know that FORMULA , so
there are FORMULA  choices for FORMULA . Overall, we get
FORMULA 
For case (2), we have FORMULA , so FORMULA  is of type
FORMULA , FORMULA . There are FORMULA 
choices for FORMULA . Fix one choice; then there are
FORMULA  choices for the cycle FORMULA . Fix one of
these also; then because of the transitivity requirement, there
are FORMULA 
choices for FORMULA . Multiplying all the numbers together and
dividing by FORMULA , we get
FORMULA 
Therefore, we have
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
Theorem 3.3  When FORMULA  is prime and FORMULA  is of type
FORMULA , the slope FORMULA .

By the slope formula, in this case
FORMULA 
Actually when FORMULA  is prime, we have
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
We will prove these formulae in the appendix by using some tricks
from number theory.

 FORMULA
We analyze this case similarly. The condition on FORMULA 
is FORMULA . Now
there are 4 possible cases:
(1) FORMULA ;
(2) FORMULA ;
(3) FORMULA ;
(4) FORMULA .
For case (1), FORMULA  is of type FORMULA . Since FORMULA  is prime,
FORMULA  must be the long cycle FORMULA , so there are FORMULA 
choices for FORMULA . Pick one; then there are FORMULA  choices for the cycle FORMULA . Fix one of these
also; then there are FORMULA  choices for FORMULA . Overall, we get
FORMULA 
For case (2), FORMULA  is of type
FORMULA , where FORMULA .
(i)FORMULA . There are FORMULA 
choices for FORMULA . Fix one of these; we then have
FORMULA  choices for the cycle
FORMULA . Fix one of these too. To keep the transitivity of
FORMULA , there are
FORMULA  choices
for FORMULA . Hence, in this case we get
FORMULA 
(ii)FORMULA . Since FORMULA  is prime and
FORMULA , we get
FORMULA  and FORMULA . So FORMULA  is of type
FORMULA  and there are
FORMULA 
choices. Fix FORMULA ; FORMULA , so there
are FORMULA  choices for the cycle
FORMULA . Fixing one of them, there are FORMULA  choices for FORMULA . Overall,
we get
FORMULA 
For case (3),
FORMULA 
FORMULA  and either FORMULA  or FORMULA .
FORMULA  is of type FORMULA : there are
FORMULA 
choices. Pick one FORMULA  and assume FORMULA . Since FORMULA  is
prime, FORMULA . The condition on FORMULA  is that FORMULA  so there are FORMULA  choices for FORMULA . Fix FORMULA ;
then there are FORMULA  choices for the cycle
FORMULA . Fixing one of these also, finally there are
FORMULA 
choices for FORMULA  . In total,
we get  FORMULA
For case (4),
FORMULA 
where FORMULA 
FORMULA  has to be of type FORMULA  as in
case (3). So there are also FORMULA 
choices for FORMULA . Fix one FORMULA ; then there are
FORMULA  choices for the cycle
FORMULA . Pick one; then there are
FORMULA  choices
for FORMULA . Overall, we get
 FORMULA
Now combining cases (3) and (4), finally we have
FORMULA 
Therefore, we have
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
Theorem 3.4  When FORMULA  is prime and FORMULA  is of type
FORMULA , the slope FORMULA .

By the slope formula, we know that
FORMULA 
Actually when FORMULA  is prime, we have
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
We also postpone the discussion of these formulae to the appendix.
Combining Theorems REF  and REF , we have finished the
proof of Theorem REF  for the case FORMULA  prime. The general
case follows from the remark below.
Remark 3.5  FORMULA  is special in that the
following equality holds:
FORMULA 
Hence, for a curve FORMULA  in FORMULA  not entirely contained in the boundary, we always
have that its slope
FORMULA . Moreover, FORMULA  if and only if FORMULA .
There is an easy but indirect way to show that in general
FORMULA , which was pointed out
to the author by Curtis T. McMullen. The idea is that for a cover
FORMULA , when the vanishing cycle FORMULA  shrinks to
a node, any component FORMULA  of FORMULA  is not
vanishing in FORMULA  since FORMULA  is not a zero cycle. Then
when FORMULA  shrinks, it will form an internal node, i.e., the
degenerate covering curve only lies in FORMULA , but not in
FORMULA . As in the following picture, loop (1) may
belong to FORMULA , but loop (2) cannot.
FIGURE 
As FORMULA , FORMULA  may be reducible, cf. section 5,
 {{cite:6939fe97-058e-453f-a8d9-d7c712c832eb}} and  {{cite:b2aa5601-536b-449d-bd52-4a94ec1e2c10}}. However, by the above argument, the
slope of each component of FORMULA  is always 10.

Remark 3.6 Another way to produce a one parameter family of degree FORMULA  covers of elliptic curves is by fixing the FORMULA -invariant of the target elliptic curve and moving one branched point. For instance, consider degree FORMULA  genus 2 covers of a fixed elliptic curve FORMULA 
simply branched at the marked point FORMULA  and another point FORMULA . Let FORMULA  vary, and then we have a 1-dimensional space FORMULA  of admissible covers which maps to FORMULA . When FORMULA  meets FORMULA , after blowing up we will get some nodal curves
as admissible covers of FORMULA  with a 2-marked stable rational tail. Using the method in {{cite:84bff619-2659-44fe-824a-7b6ec2c1af97}}, it is easy to write down the intersection number FORMULA  by the monodromy data and verify that it is not vanishing for FORMULA . By the same argument in Remark REF , the slope of FORMULA  is strictly smaller than 10. Therefore, our original one parameter family FORMULA  provides a better lower bound for slopes than the family FORMULA  does, at least for the case FORMULA .


 FORMULA
We still assume that FORMULA  is prime. Since the analysis is almost
the same as in the previous examples, we skip the discussion and state the result directly:
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
Now the slope formula says that
FORMULA 
We calculated by computer for small prime numbers FORMULA  and it seems
that FORMULA  in this case decreases to 9. This evidence leads to
the following conjecture.
Conjecture 3.7  When FORMULA  is of type FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 

Remark 3.8 Note that for FORMULA , it is already known
that the hyperelliptic divisor FORMULA  has the smallest
slope 9 among all effective divisors. So if the above conjecture
is true, then these curves FORMULA  do provide the sharp
lower bound for slopes of effective divisors on
FORMULA .

Next, we study in detail the beginning case FORMULA . The result is
the following.
Claim 3.9  For FORMULA  and FORMULA  of type FORMULA ,
FORMULA  has four irreducible components. Two of them have
slope 9 and the other two have slope FORMULA .

The proof is nothing but to enumerate all the possible solution
pairs FORMULA  modulo equivalence relation, and further
classify the orbits by the monodromy criterion, cf. Theorem REF .
In total there are 40 non-equivalent solutions in the following
list:
(1) FORMULA  (2)  FORMULA
(3) FORMULA  (4)  FORMULA
(5) FORMULA  (6)  FORMULA
(7) FORMULA  (8)  FORMULA
(9) FORMULA  (10)  FORMULA
(11) FORMULA  (12)  FORMULA
(13) FORMULA  (14)  FORMULA
(15) FORMULA  (16)  FORMULA
(17) FORMULA  (18)  FORMULA
(19) FORMULA  (20)  FORMULA
(21) FORMULA  (22)  FORMULA
(23) FORMULA  (24)  FORMULA
(25) FORMULA  (26)  FORMULA
(27) FORMULA  (28)  FORMULA
(29) FORMULA  (30)  FORMULA
(31) FORMULA  (32)  FORMULA
(33) FORMULA  (34)  FORMULA
(35) FORMULA  (36)  FORMULA
(37) FORMULA  (38)  FORMULA
(39) FORMULA  (40)  FORMULA
Now by monodromy action, it is routine to check that:
(2),(10),(13) belong to the first component FORMULA ;
(1),(3),(4),(5),(6),(7),(8),(9),(11),(12) belong to the second
component FORMULA ;
(14),(15),(16),(18),(22),(23),(24),(25),(26),(27),(38),(40) belong
to the third component FORMULA ;
(17),(19),(20),(21),(28),(29),(30),(31),(32),
(33),(34),(35),(36),(37),(39) belong to the last component
FORMULA .
Note that the slope formula can be readily used not only for the
entire curve FORMULA  but also for its irreducible components. Plugging
in the data listed above, we get
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
For a cover FORMULA  in FORMULA , FORMULA 
necessarily has a holomorphic 1-form with a zero of order 4. Let
FORMULA 
Then we know that Im
FORMULA . We define another divisor
FORMULA  to be the locus of smooth plane quartics
that have hyperflexes. The slope of FORMULA  is
FORMULA , which was worked out by Cukierman,
cf. {{cite:615b09c4-dece-4014-a3af-4afaf7db60a8}}. We also know that FORMULA  and FORMULA . It would be interesting to get some information about
the intersection of FORMULA  and
FORMULA  at the boundary of FORMULA .
First, define codimension 2 loci
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
FIGURE 
Curves in FORMULA  and FORMULA  are always double covers of rational curves
in the sense of admissible covers. It is not hard to see that
 FORMULA
For the divisor FORMULA , we have the following claim.
Claim 3.10  FORMULA

First, let us verify that FORMULA . Take a plane conic FORMULA  and
a one parameter family FORMULA  of general plane quartics, such
that FORMULA  has a hyperflex line that is also tangent to FORMULA  at
the hyperflex point. By stable reduction, as in {{cite:0a3daa8c-c553-471d-85db-d290f4bade70}},
we know that FORMULA  is a
general hyperelliptic curve for FORMULA . Then taking the limit
FORMULA  amounts
to squeezing two Weierstrass points together. So we get a general
element in FORMULA .
For FORMULA , take a banana curve FORMULA . Consider a sub linear series of FORMULA  that contracts FORMULA  and maps FORMULA 
to a tacnodal plane quartic. We still have one
dimension of freedom to impose a hyperflex line.
Now we want to show that the inclusion in the above claim is
proper. Consider the case FORMULA  in
Claim REF . When the vanishing cycle FORMULA  is of type
FORMULA , i.e., cases (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (14) and
(15), the degenerate cover is a 5-sheeted admissible covering map
from a 1-nodal geometric genus 2 curve to a rational nodal curve
totally ramified at the node and another smooth point. Note that
such a cover can be induced from a degree 5 covering map from a
smooth genus 2 curve to FORMULA  totally ramified at 3
points FORMULA  and FORMULA . These points cannot be conjugate to each
other simultaneously. Assume that FORMULA  are not conjugate.
Identify them and identify their images also. We get a covering
curve FORMULA  Im FORMULA .
But by the construction, we know that FORMULA . Therefore, we get the
desired conclusion.
Remark 3.11 It would be interesting to do the stable reduction directly for
the family FORMULA .


Counting Weighted Connected Covers
In this section, we give a method to systematically calculate
FORMULA . An analogous exposition is givin
in the note {{cite:c4d12cf5-9023-49ef-b856-10973d631b43}}. For simplicity, here we only consider the
case when FORMULA  is prime and FORMULA  is of type FORMULA . The general situation can be solved similarly without further difficulty.
For a cover FORMULA , an automorphism FORMULA  of
this cover is given by the following diagram:
FORMULA 
If FORMULA  corresponds to one solution pair FORMULA , then the automorphism FORMULA 
corresponds to an element FORMULA  such that
FORMULA .
Hence, we have the correspondence FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the set of stablizers of
the FORMULA  conjugate action.
In many cases people are interested in the weighted Hurwitz
numbers, i.e., counting a cover FORMULA  with weight
FORMULA . Hence, we define a
weighted number
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  denotes
the conjugacy class FORMULA . In particular
when FORMULA  is prime, the cover has no non-trivial automorphism since
FORMULA  is transitive, cf. Lemma REF  and REF . So we can pretend to
count weighted connected covers instead.
Now we want to get rid of the transitivity condition
imposed on FORMULA . So we further define a set
FORMULA 
and let
FORMULA 
We fix an element FORMULA  and look for pairs FORMULA 
such that FORMULA . For such a pair, there are
FORMULA  choices for FORMULA  that
satisfy the equality FORMULA . Hence,
FORMULA 
By
{{cite:cccd9012-e81d-45f9-9f6d-a2da38a42934}}, we know that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  runs over all
irreducible characters of FORMULA . Therefore, we get the following
expression
FORMULA 
Now our task is to derive FORMULA  from
FORMULA . Take a solution pair FORMULA . The subgroup FORMULA  of
FORMULA  may not be transitive. Consider the orbits and the action
of FORMULA  on them, which correspond to the following data:
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
Two data FORMULA  and FORMULA  are
of the same type if FORMULA  and
FORMULA . Hence, we get the following equality
FORMULA 
where the
condition on the summation is
FORMULA  and
FORMULA  Simplifying
the above expression, we obtain
FORMULA 
If FORMULA  is of type FORMULA , a datum
FORMULA  corresponds to a vector
FORMULA  with integer entries.
Put all the vectors into a matrix
FORMULA 
Then the summation runs over all possible FORMULA 
satisfying
FORMULA 
Now slightly change the notation. Define an index set
FORMULA 
For FORMULA  of type FORMULA , write it as
FORMULA . So it is determined by an element
FORMULA , and
FORMULA .
We define two generating functions as follows:
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  is of type FORMULA  for each term.
Therefore, finally we obtain the relation between the generating functions for the number of connected
and possibly disconnected covers:
FORMULA 
Remark 4.1 If FORMULA  is odd or FORMULA , then obviously
FORMULA . The
evaluation of a character FORMULA  on a conjugacy class FORMULA  can be
worked out by standard formulae from the representation theory of
FORMULA . However, when FORMULA  is large, it seems hard to evaluate the
quotient FORMULA  even by computer. So the
estimate of FORMULA 
remains mysterious to us.


The Local Geometry of  FORMULA
In this section, we study the local monodromy action of the map
FORMULA  mentioned in Remark REF , and via it we obtain information like the
genus, orbifold points and orbifold Euler characteristic of FORMULA .
For each component of FORMULA , we take its reduced scheme structure.
An orbifold point of FORMULA  possibly occurs when a smooth cover
degenerates to a singular cover, and its orbifold order depends on
the information about the degree of a local minimal base change
and the order of its extra automorphisms (not induced from nearby
covers), cf. Remark REF . The following two examples would
illustrate the idea.
Basic Examples
Example 1:  FORMULA
There are three non-equivalent solution pairs FORMULA :
(1) FORMULA ;
(2) FORMULA ;
(3) FORMULA .
When FORMULA  corresponds to the vanishing cycle, the local
monodromy action FORMULA  can switch sheets (1) and (2) but keep (3) unchanged,
and the global monodromy can send all three sheets to each other.
So FORMULA  is a degree 3 connected cover of FORMULA  simply branched at
FORMULA . By Riemann-Hurwitz, FORMULA  so  FORMULA
Furthermore, over FORMULA , sheets (1) and (2) meet at the
ramification point FORMULA , and the other pre-image point FORMULA  lies in
sheet (3).
FIGURE 
Since in case (3), FORMULA  is a length 3 cycle, as in
Remark REF  a degree 3 base change is necessary to complete
the universal covering map locally over sheet (3). So FORMULA  is an
orbifold point with structure group FORMULA . By contrast,
locally around FORMULA , we need a degree 2 base change since FORMULA 
contains length 2 cycles. But sheets (1) and (2) meet at FORMULA , so
the cover corresponding to FORMULA  does not have an extra order 2
automorphism compared with nearby smooth covers. Hence, FORMULA  is not
an orbifold point of FORMULA . Finally, by the orbifold Euler
characteristic formula, we have
FORMULA 
Remark 5.1 By using the results about FORMULA  in section 5.2 and 5.3, we can
work out the orbifold Euler characteristic of FORMULA  in
the same way when FORMULA  or
FORMULA  and FORMULA  is prime. Note that the result for
general FORMULA  is obtained in {{cite:361b0075-5e35-4886-bcc9-64ca7f4462de}}, although only the case
FORMULA  is discussed there.

It is also natural to study the degenerate covers directly and
recover the information obtained from the local monodromy action.
The cover corresponding to FORMULA  can be induced from a degree 3
covering map from an elliptic curve to FORMULA  totally
branched over 3 points FORMULA  by identifying
FORMULA  and their pre-images. The following picture reveals
the idea. A ramification point with order FORMULA  is marked by FORMULA 
in the picture.
FIGURE 
Hence, we look at triples FORMULA 
in FORMULA  such that FORMULA  and
FORMULA  is of type FORMULA . The only possible solution is
FORMULA  and therefore this cover has
an order 3 automorphism, which coincides with our above discussion.
For FORMULA , we look at a degree 3 covering map FORMULA  from FORMULA  to FORMULA  simply branched at FORMULA  and
totally branched at FORMULA . Assume that
FORMULA . Identify FORMULA . Then we can recover the map corresponding to FORMULA .
FIGURE 
Hence, consider triples FORMULA  in
FORMULA  such that FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and FORMULA  are simple transpositions but
FORMULA  is a FORMULA  cycle. Modulo the FORMULA  conjugation
action, there is a unique solution corresponding to
FORMULA  If we switch FORMULA 
and FORMULA , we get back the same cover, so it has the
automorphism induced from the involution FORMULA . But it does not
have other automorphisms. This result also coincides with our
previous analysis.
Example 2:  FORMULA
We only focus on the case when the vanishing cycle FORMULA  is of
type FORMULA , i.e., cases (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (14) and
(15) in the proof of Claim REF . The local monodromy acts
transitively on (1),(3),(4),(5),(6), but keeps (2),(14),(15)
fixed. Let FORMULA  be the point over FORMULA  where the sheets
(1),(3),(4),(5),(6) meet, and FORMULA  be the other 3 pre-images of
FORMULA  contained in (2),(14),(15) respectively. Since locally
around FORMULA  we need a degree 5 base change, FORMULA  are
orbifold points with structure group FORMULA , and FORMULA  is not
an orbifold point.
FIGURE 
Also note that if we consider FORMULA  instead of
FORMULA , then (1)-(6) are still distinct sheets in FORMULA  and they all
have automorphisms induced from the elliptic involution FORMULA .
However, (14) has to be identified with (15) under the new
equivalence relation FORMULA  for FORMULA .
Again, we can study the degenerate covers directly as the previous
example. In this case, the covers corresponding to FORMULA  can
be induced by degree 5 covers from genus 2 curves to FORMULA  totally branched over 3 points FORMULA . We then
identify FORMULA  and their pre-image points to obtain the
desired singular covers. Now we need to analyze the solution
triples FORMULA  in FORMULA  such that
FORMULA  and they are all FORMULA 
cycles. Take FORMULA , then FORMULA  can only
be FORMULA  or FORMULA , modulo the FORMULA 
conjugation action. For the case FORMULA ,
after switching FORMULA  and FORMULA , we get a cover
equivalent to the case FORMULA  So these two
covers can be exchanged by the involution of the target rational
nodal curve and they correspond to FORMULA  and FORMULA  in sheets (14) and
(15). For FORMULA , switching FORMULA  and
FORMULA , we get the same cover. Moreover, this cover does
not have automorphisms except the one induced by the involution
FORMULA . So it corresponds to the non-orbifold point FORMULA . Finally,
if FORMULA , this cover has the automorphism
induced by FORMULA  and another order 5 automorphism, so it
corresponds to FORMULA  in sheet (2).
Now we study in general the orbits of local monodromy for the case
FORMULA  and FORMULA  prime. Starting from one solution pair
FORMULA  where FORMULA  is the vanishing cycle, the local
monodromy action can send FORMULA  to
FORMULA , so these two sheets have to meet at the
same degenerate cover over FORMULA  We also assume that
FORMULA  where
FORMULA  is of type FORMULA  or FORMULA .

 FORMULA
We give a proof of Theorem REF . All the numbers FORMULA  and
FORMULA  in the proof below are from
section 3.1.
Let FORMULA  be a fixed
cycle in FORMULA . We look for FORMULA  such that there exists an
element FORMULA , FORMULA  Note that such FORMULA  must satisfy
FORMULA  since
FORMULA 
If FORMULA  is of type FORMULA , from FORMULA ,
we get FORMULA  for some integer FORMULA . So if
FORMULA , then FORMULA . As long
as FORMULA  is prime, FORMULA  must be FORMULA  and FORMULA . Since
FORMULA , we get
FORMULA  orbits each of which has
cardinality FORMULA . From the viewpoint of the covering map FORMULA , the FORMULA  sheets in one orbit meet at a degenerate cover which
is not an orbifold point of FORMULA , since locally around such a point
we need a degree FORMULA  base change to
realize the universal covering map in the proof of Theorem REF .
If FORMULA  is of type FORMULA ,
FORMULA  we know FORMULA . Without loss of
generality, assume that
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
and that
FORMULA  From the condition
FORMULA  and FORMULA 
prime, we can verify that FORMULA  fixes all the elements in the
cycles FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Then we have
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
So we can assume that FORMULA  sends the cycle
FORMULA  to FORMULA  and the cycle
FORMULA  to FORMULA . Furthermore, assume that FORMULA  but FORMULA  and
FORMULA , i.e., these actions are twisted by twist parameters FORMULA  and
FORMULA , whose geometric meaning can be more clearly seen in {{cite:6939fe97-058e-453f-a8d9-d7c712c832eb}} and the next section.
Now, FORMULA  contains a cycle FORMULA 
and the corresponding cycle in FORMULA  is FORMULA 
Since FORMULA  and FORMULA  are all fixed by FORMULA , we get FORMULA .
Similarly we have FORMULA . One can check that these two conditions on FORMULA  are also sufficient for the existence
of FORMULA .
Since FORMULA , for FORMULA  of
such type we just get FORMULA  orbits and
each orbit has cardinality
 FORMULA
Consider the map FORMULA . By the Riemann-Hurwitz formula,
we have
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
After simplifying, we get
the desired expression in the theorem.
Furthermore, we already know that FORMULA  and
FORMULA . In the appendix we will see that FORMULA  has lower order than FORMULA , so we also obtain the asymptotic result for FORMULA .
Remark 5.2 In the next section, we will see that the above FORMULA  has two
irreducible components FORMULA  and FORMULA  that do not intersect, cf. Theorem REF .
So actually we have  FORMULA

Remark 5.3 Note that a similar genus formula for the case FORMULA  and FORMULA  prime is also obtained in {{cite:6939fe97-058e-453f-a8d9-d7c712c832eb}} using
the technique of square-tiled surfaces. However, our space of
admissible covers FORMULA  differs from the Teichmüller discs
defined in {{cite:6939fe97-058e-453f-a8d9-d7c712c832eb}} in that FORMULA  is closed and it is over a pencil
of plane cubics rather than FORMULA .


 FORMULA
Now we study the other case: FORMULA , and prove
Theorem REF . All the numbers FORMULA  and FORMULA  in the following proof are from section 3.2.
Let FORMULA  be a fixed
cycle. We still look for FORMULA  such that there exists FORMULA , FORMULA 
As before, such FORMULA  must satisfy FORMULA 
The discussion is very similar to the one above. We analyze the
solution pairs FORMULA  case by case based on the type of
the vanishing cycle
 FORMULA
If FORMULA  is of type FORMULA , assume that FORMULA . From FORMULA  we get that FORMULA  must be
FORMULA  for some integer FORMULA . But FORMULA , since FORMULA  FORMULA , so in this case
we get
FORMULA 
orbits, each of which contains FORMULA  sheets meeting at one
degenerate cover over FORMULA .
If FORMULA  is of type FORMULA ,
FORMULA  we can write FORMULA  as
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
and FORMULA  By
FORMULA  and FORMULA  co-prime, we know
that FORMULA  fixes all the elements in FORMULA  and FORMULA . Then we have
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
So we can assume that FORMULA  sends the cycle
FORMULA  to FORMULA , FORMULA  to FORMULA , and
FORMULA  to FORMULA  FORMULA  but FORMULA  i.e., these actions
are twisted by twist parameters FORMULA  and FORMULA .
FORMULA  contains a cycle FORMULA  and the
corresponding cycle in FORMULA  is FORMULA  Since
FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are all fixed by FORMULA , we get FORMULA .
Similarly, we have FORMULA .
These conditions are also sufficient. Since
FORMULA , we
get FORMULA  orbits in this
case, and each orbit contains
FORMULA  elements.
If FORMULA  is of type FORMULA ,
FORMULA , we can write
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
If FORMULA , then
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
We can always assume that FORMULA  sends the cycle FORMULA  to
FORMULA  and FORMULA  to
FORMULA . Moreover, FORMULA  and FORMULA , but
FORMULA  and FORMULA , where FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are the twist parameters.
Now by FORMULA , if FORMULA  and FORMULA , we get FORMULA , which is impossible.
Hence, FORMULA  acts trivially on the elements in the cycles FORMULA  and  FORMULA
The cycle of FORMULA  starting from FORMULA  can be written as
FORMULA 
and the corresponding cycle of FORMULA  is
FORMULA 
Since FORMULA  and FORMULA 
are all fixed by FORMULA , we get FORMULA .
Similarly, we have FORMULA . These two conditions on FORMULA  are
also sufficient to find a desired FORMULA . Hence in this case,
there are FORMULA  orbits and each
orbit contains
FORMULA  elements.
There is one more case when FORMULA  is of type
FORMULA , FORMULA ; namely, FORMULA  and
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
We can also check that FORMULA  acts trivially on FORMULA  and
FORMULA .
Assume that, similarly to the last case, FORMULA  acts with twist
parameters FORMULA  and FORMULA  at the end. Then FORMULA  contains
one cycle
FORMULA 
and the corresponding cycle in FORMULA  is
FORMULA 
Since FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are all fixed by FORMULA , we get FORMULA .
Similarly we have FORMULA . So in this case there are
FORMULA  orbits and each orbit
contains
FORMULA  elements.
The last case is when FORMULA  is of type FORMULA .
Assume FORMULA  and FORMULA  Then we have
FORMULA 
We can further assume
FORMULA  for FORMULA  and FORMULA  Since
FORMULA , we only need to check when there exists FORMULA 
such that FORMULA  and
 FORMULA
It is not hard to see that FORMULA  can be of type
FORMULA 
or
FORMULA 
If FORMULA  is odd, then
FORMULA  can be
FORMULA 
or
FORMULA 
respectively.
Note that here FORMULA  is not of the same type as FORMULA , so FORMULA  does not exist.
If FORMULA  is even, then FORMULA  can be
FORMULA 
or
FORMULA 
Here it is easy to check that the desired FORMULA  always exists.
Therefore, since FORMULA , we get FORMULA  orbits and each orbit contains
FORMULA  elements.
Putting all the results together, we obtain, by the
Riemann-Hurwitz formula, for the map  FORMULA
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
After simplifying, we get exactly the expression in the theorem.
The asymptotic behavior of FORMULA  follows from the result about the expression of FORMULA .
Again, the terms involving FORMULA  do not affect the asymptotic order.
Remark 5.4 In the next section we will see that the above FORMULA  has at least
two components, based on the different types of subgroups
generated by FORMULA .


Square-Tiled Surfaces
In this section, we establish a correspondence between our method and the work in {{cite:6939fe97-058e-453f-a8d9-d7c712c832eb}} from the viewpoint of
square-tiled surfaces.
The idea is quite simple. Take a standard torus FORMULA . If FORMULA  is a
cover of FORMULA , then FORMULA  can be realized as a possibly degenerate
lattice polygon with some edges and vertices identified. It covers
FORMULA  unit squares if the degree of the map is FORMULA . We will explain
the details by some examples for the case FORMULA . As before, we
only consider the situation when FORMULA  is prime.
 FORMULA
In this case, if there is a degree FORMULA  covering map FORMULA  only ramified at one point FORMULA , then FORMULA  can be realized
as an octagon of area FORMULA . All of its vertices are identified to
be the unique ramification point FORMULA  marked with a FORMULA  in
the following picture. Take also two loops FORMULA  and FORMULA  of
the torus FORMULA  as in the picture.
FIGURE 
Mark the unit squares covered by the octagon by FORMULA , and
consider the monodromy images in FORMULA  induced from FORMULA  and FORMULA . Let us look at two examples.
Example 1:
Consider the following octagon.
FIGURE 
It should correspond to a degree 5 cover of FORMULA . We still abuse
notation and use FORMULA  to denote also their monodromy
images. It is easy to see FORMULA  and FORMULA 
Then we can check that
FORMULA  has the desired ramification type.
Example 2:
Consider another octagon.
FIGURE 
The area is still 5. This time we get FORMULA  and FORMULA .
So FORMULA  has the required ramification type.
Remark 6.1 In {{cite:6939fe97-058e-453f-a8d9-d7c712c832eb}}, the square-tiled octagons can be of two types:
one-cylinder type and two-cylinder type. The one-cylinder type
corresponds to FORMULA  as in example 1, and the
two-cylinder type
corresponds to FORMULA  as in example 2.
Moreover, also in {{cite:6939fe97-058e-453f-a8d9-d7c712c832eb}}, it is shown that we can mark the 6
Weierstrass points of FORMULA . 1 or 3 out of the 6 points are integer
points, which provides two different parities invariant under the
monodromy action. It follows immediately that
FORMULA  has at least two components. On the other
hand, by our method using FORMULA , one can check that 1 and 3
integer Weierstrass points
correspond to FORMULA  and FORMULA  respectively.
For instance, in the first example, FORMULA . Of
course the ramification point is one Weierstrass point, and we
mark the others with a FORMULA  in the following picture. Note that
only the ramification point is an integer Weierstrass point.
FIGURE 
In the second example, FORMULA . From the picture below, we can see that there are exactly 3 integer Weierstrass points.
FIGURE 


 FORMULA
In this case we will have 2 ramification points on FORMULA . We mark
them with a FORMULA  and a FORMULA  respectively.
As in {{cite:28ff644a-a11d-415d-8cf2-524f2e9f02ad}}, FORMULA  can be realized as a decagon. Let us look at some examples.
Example 3: Consider a decagon in the following picture
and mark the unit squares.
FIGURE 
This time FORMULA  We get FORMULA  and FORMULA . So FORMULA  Note that FORMULA  is of type FORMULA . In general,
this is the one-cylinder type corresponding to
FORMULA  in our previous discussion.
Example 4: Consider another decagon with area 7.
FIGURE 
FORMULA  and FORMULA  so
FORMULA  In general, this is the two-cylinder type
corresponding to FORMULA .
Example 5: For the case FORMULA , we can consider an
example such as the following.
FIGURE 
FORMULA  and FORMULA .
So FORMULA . In general, this corresponds to the
three-cylinder type.
Remark 6.2 In {{cite:6939fe97-058e-453f-a8d9-d7c712c832eb}}, there are two actions FORMULA  and FORMULA  defined by the following pictures.
FIGURE 
Actually they correspond to our monodromy actions FORMULA  and
FORMULA  respectively. For
instance, in the first example, applying the action FORMULA , the
direction of FORMULA  does not change but FORMULA  changes to a
direction FORMULA  parallel to the diagonal.

After the action FORMULA , we get FORMULA . Hence, the method in
{{cite:6939fe97-058e-453f-a8d9-d7c712c832eb}} to work out the number of components of FORMULA  by the monodromy actions can be similarly carried out here.

The reader may also be aware of the correspondence between our monodromy actions and the
butterfly moves defined in {{cite:b2aa5601-536b-449d-bd52-4a94ec1e2c10}}. Actually, the result in {{cite:b2aa5601-536b-449d-bd52-4a94ec1e2c10}}
is more general, not only for FORMULA  prime. We simply cite the result
as the following theorem.
Theorem 6.3 
The Teichmüller curve FORMULA  is irreducible for FORMULA  even or FORMULA ,
and has exactly two components for FORMULA  odd.

However, to the best of the author's knowledge, for the case FORMULA  the question below is still unknown.
Question 6.4 How many irreducible components does the curve FORMULA  have?

It is relatively easy to get a lower bound for the number of components. For instance, when FORMULA  is odd,
pick a solution pair FORMULA . Then FORMULA , and FORMULA  is a subgroup of FORMULA . We can take another solution pair
FORMULA . Then FORMULA , and FORMULA . Hence, in this case FORMULA  has at least two components.

Appendix
In this appendix, we will prove the equalities (1), (2), (3) and
(4) in section 3. First, we introduce the following functions
FORMULA 
These summations are quasi-modular forms with certain weights.
Now define three series
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
There are some fundamental relations among FORMULA  and FORMULA  – the
Ramanujan differential equations, cf. {{cite:a1109973-fc70-4ac5-9723-f2d0cad9ec59}}:
FORMULA 
Lemma 7.1
FORMULA 

Note that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  means the coefficient of the degree FORMULA  term
in the series expansion, and
FORMULA 
Similarly, we have
FORMULA 
Hence, we get
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
When FORMULA  is prime, the right side of the last equality equals
FORMULA . Moreover,
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
Now the equalities (1), (2) for FORMULA  and FORMULA  for FORMULA  of
type FORMULA  follow immediately.
Similarly one can verify the equalities (3) and (4).
Now we turn to the asymptotic result for FORMULA  in
Theorem REF . It suffices to verify that FORMULA  has
asymptotic order less than 3. Actually in {{cite:6939fe97-058e-453f-a8d9-d7c712c832eb}}, the order is
proved to be less than FORMULA 
for any FORMULA  The asymptotic behavior of FORMULA  in
Theorem REF  can be estimated similarly to show that it is
less than 4.
