Production of Its Neutral and Doubly Charged PartnersInvited talk at the workshop, YKIS2006, on "New Frontiers on QCD"

By studying FORMULA  and
FORMULA  decays, it is shown that
assigning FORMULA  to the iso-triplet four-quark meson
FORMULA  is favored. Productions of its partners FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are also studied. As the result, it is concluded that
they could be observed in FORMULA  and
FORMULA . Their iso-singlet partner
FORMULA  might have been observed in the radiative
FORMULA  decays by
the BELLE collaboration.
Introduction
Inclusive FORMULA  annihilation
experiments {{cite:b2475651-8f8b-4ced-9f75-4841565ab1d7}}, {{cite:67cfe7a5-0ea2-43e2-9b44-fee2503e15fa}} have observed a narrow
(FORMULA  MeV {{cite:54912964-4de8-47e1-8500-2555230052af}}) scalar resonance [denoted by
FORMULA ] in the FORMULA  channel.
However, no evidence for it has been observed in the FORMULA 
channel, so that a severe constraint {{cite:67cfe7a5-0ea2-43e2-9b44-fee2503e15fa}},
FORMULA 
has been provided. In addition, we here list the measured
ratio of decay rates {{cite:54912964-4de8-47e1-8500-2555230052af}}
FORMULA 
Eq. (REF ) implies that the isospin non-conserving
interaction is much weaker than the electromagnetic interaction.
Therefore, Eq. (REF ) means that the underlying
interaction of the decay FORMULA  is
much stronger than the electromagnetic interaction, i.e., it is the
ordinary strong interaction as is well known. In this case,
FORMULA  should be an iso-triplet meson which can be realized by
a four-quark state.
To confirm the above conjecture, we shortly visit scalar four-quark
mesons and discuss that charm-strange scalar four-quark mesons can be
narrow, in II, and study their radiative decays and isospin
non-conserving decays in III. Productions of charm-strange scalar
mesons in FORMULA  annihilation and in hadronic FORMULA  decays are
investigated in IV. A brief summary is given in the final
section.

Charmed Scalar Four-quark Mesons
Observed low lying scalar mesons {{cite:54912964-4de8-47e1-8500-2555230052af}},
FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
can be well understood by the FORMULA  states,
FORMULA ,
FORMULA ,
FORMULA ,
FORMULA , FORMULA ,
which are dominantly of FORMULA  of color FORMULA , as
suggested long time ago {{cite:0a8f52ec-240d-4c09-81ff-569193985f79}} and supported at this
workshop {{cite:741bbff2-a2d2-4acf-8c60-5842f28f1d13}}. (However, for simplicity, a possible small
mixing of FORMULA  is ignored in this talk.)
With this in mind, we replace one of light quarks in
FORMULA  by the charm quark FORMULA . Then we have the
charmed scalar FORMULA  mesons,
FORMULA ,
FORMULA ,
FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and
FORMULA .
However, we here study only FORMULA  and FORMULA . (For
the other components, see Refs.{{cite:f636689e-0418-448a-bd4e-1e27c7c19bc4}}, {{cite:9ebd5f9b-82ff-40dc-ad80-d364e0e7ae5d}}, {{cite:994cf38f-a8b3-4421-ba68-b9c294df37d2}}.)
When we assign {{cite:f636689e-0418-448a-bd4e-1e27c7c19bc4}} FORMULA  to FORMULA 
as conjectured in I, one might wonder if it can be so narrow.
However, its narrow width can be understood by a small rate for the
dominant decay FORMULA  which is given by a
small overlap of (color and spin) wavefunctions. Such a small overlap
can be seen by decomposing a color-singlet scalar four-quark state of
FORMULA  into a sum of products of FORMULA  pairs.
The coefficient of the product of two color- and spin-less
FORMULA  pairs in the decomposition provides the overlap under
consideration. Therefore, the parameters describing the overlaps
between a charm-strange scalar four-quark meson and two pseudoscalar
mesons, for example, FORMULA  (or FORMULA ) and FORMULA 
(or FORMULA ) is given by FORMULA , and the corresponding
one between FORMULA  (or FORMULA ) and FORMULA  (or
FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA ) is provided by FORMULA . (However,
in the case of the conventional mesons, the corresponding overlap is
unity, because their color and spin configuration is unique.) For more
details, see Refs. {{cite:dcc0d656-9101-4255-970c-7cc87fb4806f}}, {{cite:994cf38f-a8b3-4421-ba68-b9c294df37d2}}, {{cite:766ff18a-e158-4a1a-bc98-56ccacb5e469}}.
To see numerically that FORMULA  is narrow, we use a hard pion
technique in the infinite momentum frame {{cite:f47fb494-a703-483d-a8ed-4eab0df94934}}. In this
approximation, the amplitude for two body decay
FORMULA 
is given by
FORMULA 
where the asymptotic matrix element FORMULA 
has been evaluated in the infinite momentum frame.
Then, by assigning FORMULA  to FORMULA  and using
FORMULA  MeV
from the measured peak width {{cite:54912964-4de8-47e1-8500-2555230052af}} as the input data, a rather
small rate
FORMULA 
can be obtained, where the FORMULA -FORMULA  mixing with the mixing angle
FORMULA  has been taken. Because the
spatial wavefunction overlap is in the FORMULA  symmetry limit at this
stage, however, it is expected that the amplitude is overestimated by
about FORMULA  %. It can be seen {{cite:994cf38f-a8b3-4421-ba68-b9c294df37d2}} by
comparing the measured rates for the FORMULA  decays with
the estimated ones in which the measured
FORMULA  MeV {{cite:54912964-4de8-47e1-8500-2555230052af}}
is adopted as the input data. Taking account for the above symmetry
breaking, we can get
FORMULA  MeV.
This leads to a sufficiently narrow width of
FORMULA  {{cite:dcc0d656-9101-4255-970c-7cc87fb4806f}}, {{cite:994cf38f-a8b3-4421-ba68-b9c294df37d2}}.


Radiative Decays and Isospin Non-conserving Decays

Since it has been known that the vector meson dominance (VMD) with the
ideal FORMULA -FORMULA  mixing and the flavor FORMULA  symmetry for the
strong vertices works fairly well in the radiative decays of light
vector mesons {{cite:4d3de734-2395-461b-97b8-d23e6501546b}}, we will extend it to the system
containing charm quark(s) below. Under the VMD, the amplitude
FORMULA  can be approximated by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the FORMULA  coupling strength on the photon
mass-shell. FORMULA  is dependent on
photon-momentum-square {{cite:4d3de734-2395-461b-97b8-d23e6501546b}}, and the values of FORMULA 
have been estimated from the analyses in photoproductions of vector
mesons on various nuclei {{cite:7ba074d2-54e1-4ad0-9902-40999591aa0b}}. The results are
FORMULA  GeVFORMULA ,
FORMULA  GeVFORMULA ,
FORMULA  GeVFORMULA  and
FORMULA  GeVFORMULA ,
where the last one has been obtained from
FORMULA  nb/GeVFORMULA 
and
FORMULA  mb {{cite:33c50cfa-f84e-4b1e-bd14-57a3f484936a}}
for the FORMULA  total cross section. (FORMULA  denotes a nucleon).
The FORMULA  coupling strength can be estimated as
FORMULA 
from the measured rate {{cite:54912964-4de8-47e1-8500-2555230052af}}
FORMULA  MeV
by putting FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  in
Eq. (REF ) and by inserting the above FORMULA 
into it, because the FORMULA  amplitude is
dominated by the FORMULA  pole. The OZI-rule allowed poles for the
amplitude FORMULA  are given by the FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and FORMULA  mesons. The relevant FORMULA  relation
FORMULA 
with Eq. (REF ) leads to
FORMULA  keV.
By comparing the above rate with the measured one {{cite:54912964-4de8-47e1-8500-2555230052af}}
FORMULA  keV
(with FORMULA  50 % errors), it is seen {{cite:994cf38f-a8b3-4421-ba68-b9c294df37d2}} that (the VMD with)
the FORMULA  symmetry (of spatial wavefunction overlap) again
overestimates the rate by FORMULA  %, as in II.
Now we study radiative decays of charm-strange mesons. The amplitude
for FORMULA  is dominated by FORMULA  and FORMULA 
poles. Taking the FORMULA  symmetry relation,
FORMULA ,
and Eq. (REF ), we can obtain the rate for the
FORMULA  listed in Table I.
TABLE 
For radiative decays of scalar mesons, we consider typical three cases,
(i) FORMULA , (ii) FORMULA  and (iii)
FORMULA . Under the VMD, the amplitude is obtained by replacing
FORMULA  in Eq. (REF ) in terms of FORMULA .
In the case (i), the amplitude
FORMULA  is dominated by the FORMULA 
and FORMULA  poles.
Using the FORMULA  relation,
FORMULA ,
and the input data,
FORMULA 
keV {{cite:54912964-4de8-47e1-8500-2555230052af}},
we have the rate for the decay FORMULA 
listed in Table I. The amplitudes
FORMULA  and
FORMULA  in the cases (ii) and (iii)
are dominated by the FORMULA  pole and the FORMULA  pole, respectively.
Taking the FORMULA  relation,
FORMULA ,
with the overlap parameter FORMULA  given in II and the
input data,
FORMULA 
keV {{cite:54912964-4de8-47e1-8500-2555230052af}},
we have the rates for radiative decays of charm-strange mesons listed
in Table I, where the spatial wavefunction overlap is still in the
FORMULA  symmetry limit. Then, the ratio of the rate
FORMULA 
in Table I to
FORMULA  estimated
in II,
FORMULA 
satisfies well the constraint Eq. (REF ).
Isospin non-conserving decays are now in order. The amplitude for the
FORMULA  decay can be obtained by putting
FORMULA  and FORMULA  in Eq. (REF ). Here we
assume {{cite:f4a1b56f-16ac-4f51-a075-f99d5929fea9}} that the isospin non-conservation in decays of
charm-strange mesons is caused by the FORMULA -FORMULA  mixing whose
mixing parameter FORMULA  has been estimated to be {{cite:0da43df9-7785-4790-9108-c12a83921dd2}}
FORMULA 
It is very small and of the order of the fine structure constant
FORMULA . This implies that the isospin non-conserving interaction is
much weaker than the electromagnetic one. The FORMULA  symmetry of
asymptotic matrix elements and the FORMULA -FORMULA  mixing lead to
FORMULA ,
where FORMULA  for the usual FORMULA -FORMULA  mixing
angle FORMULA . The size of
FORMULA  can be estimated to be
FORMULA  {{cite:f47fb494-a703-483d-a8ed-4eab0df94934}}
from the measured rate {{cite:54912964-4de8-47e1-8500-2555230052af}}
FORMULA  MeV.
In this way, we are lead to
FORMULA .
Comparing this result with
FORMULA  in Table I,
we obtain
FORMULA .
This is much smaller than unity, as conjectured in I, and
reproduces well the measurement Eq. (REF ).
Therefore, the present approach seems to be reliable.
With this in mind, we consider two cases of the isospin non-conserving
decays of scalar mesons,
(i) FORMULA 
and
(ii) FORMULA .
The amplitude for the FORMULA  decay is obtained by
putting FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  in Eq. (REF ).
Since this decay is assumed to proceed through the FORMULA -FORMULA 
mixing as discussed above, we replace the matrix elements,
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA ,
by the OZI-rule allowed
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA ,
respectively. The FORMULA  relations of asymptotic matrix elements
are
FORMULA  in the case (i) and
FORMULA 
in the case (ii). The size of the former is estimated to be
FORMULA 
from the experimental data {{cite:54912964-4de8-47e1-8500-2555230052af}},
FORMULA  MeV,
and the isospin FORMULA  symmetry, where it has been assumed that
FORMULA  is the conventional FORMULA 
state {{cite:54912964-4de8-47e1-8500-2555230052af}}. The latter has already been obtained as
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
in II. Using the above results on the asymptotic matrix
elements, the value of FORMULA  in Eq. (REF ) and
FORMULA , we have the rates for the isospin non-conserving
decays,
FORMULA .
These results are much smaller than the rates for the radiative decays
of the charm-strange scalar mesons listed in Table I, as conjectured
in I. Eventually, the ratios of decay rates under consideration
can be obtained as
(i) FORMULA , (ii) FORMULA  and
(iii) FORMULA  in Eq. (REF ).
In this way, it is seen that the experimental constraint
Eq. (REF ) can be satisfied only in the case
(iii). (For more details, see Refs. {{cite:994cf38f-a8b3-4421-ba68-b9c294df37d2}}, {{cite:dcc0d656-9101-4255-970c-7cc87fb4806f}}) Its
assignment to an iso-singlet FORMULA  molecule {{cite:8ddd33d5-4954-47e9-a1a4-06c92785d618}} has already been
rejected {{cite:49a230f5-937b-4b91-98f2-9e2eec0f4325}} because it leads to
FORMULA 
as in (ii). Thus we conclude that assigning FORMULA  to
FORMULA  is favored by the experiments while its assignment to the
FORMULA  state, the conventional scalar FORMULA  or the scalar
four-quark FORMULA  (or the FORMULA  molecule), is not favored.

Production of Charm-strange Scalar Mesons
Although assigning FORMULA  to FORMULA  is favored by
experiments as seen above, its neutral and doubly charged partners,
FORMULA  and FORMULA , have not yet been observed by
inclusive FORMULA  annihilation experiment {{cite:903c9321-f9d6-4c19-ba5c-47bca9c87235}}.
Therefore, we now study productions of charm-strange scalar four-quark
mesons (FORMULA  and FORMULA ). To this aim, we consider
their production through weak interactions, as a possible candidate,
because OZI-rule violating creations of multiple FORMULA -pairs and
their recombinations into four-quark meson states are expected to be
strongly suppressed at high energies {{cite:766ff18a-e158-4a1a-bc98-56ccacb5e469}}. We,
first, recall the so-called BSW Hamiltonian {{cite:a5f2ba89-4aa4-4e80-9c62-f668851cf363}} as the effective
weak Hamiltonian,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are four-quark operators given by products of
neutral and charged currents, respectively, and provide amplitudes for
color suppressed and color favored decays, respectively, under the
factorization prescription. The extra term FORMULA  is automatically
induced when the BSW Hamiltonian is obtained. It is given by a sum of
products of colored currents and provides a non-factorizable amplitude,
so that it is usually taken away. However, in this talk, it is left
intact {{cite:7d6cf165-b878-478a-a272-ca9f8e99c894}}, {{cite:dd37dda4-387d-47b3-bc83-7e833fefe4c2}} because it can play an
important role in production of charm-strange scalar four-quark mesons.
Next, we draw quark-line diagrams within the minimal FORMULA -pair
creation, because multiple FORMULA -pair creation is expected to be
suppressed due to the OZI rule. In this approximation, the quark-line
diagrams related to production of charm-strange scalar four-quark mesons
in FORMULA  annihilation are given in Fig. 1.
FIGURE 
FIGURE 
Because there is no diagram to describe production of FORMULA 
in this approximation, as seen in Fig. 1, it is understood why the
FORMULA  experiment {{cite:903c9321-f9d6-4c19-ba5c-47bca9c87235}} found no
evidence for it. Productions of FORMULA , FORMULA  and
FORMULA  mesons are described by Figs. 1(c) and (d). The diagrams
Figs. 1(a) and (b) in which the weak vertices are given by the color
favored spectator diagrams describe productions of FORMULA ,
FORMULA , FORMULA , etc. and FORMULA , FORMULA ,
FORMULA , etc., respectively. By the way, it is known that color
favored spectator decays are much stronger than color mismatched decays
under the factorization prescription (i.e.,
FORMULA  at the scale of charm
mass {{cite:cd5dfc34-c217-4df6-be05-bf9c8e87447c}}). In addition,
non-factorizable contributions are actually small in hadronic weak
decays of FORMULA  mesons {{cite:7d6cf165-b878-478a-a272-ca9f8e99c894}}, and they will be much
smaller at higher energies. As seen in Fig. 1, productions of
FORMULA  and FORMULA  involve rearrangements of colors and
their amplitudes are non-factorizable, so that they will be much more
strongly suppressed than the color favored processes. Therefore, it is
not very easy to extract the FORMULA  signals
in inclusive FORMULA  experiments. In the case
of FORMULA , however, one does not need to worry about large numbers
of background events from Figs. 1(a) and (b) because its main decay is
FORMULA . Nevertheless, its evidence has not
been observed in the radiative channel, because its decay into
FORMULA  is strongly suppressed as seen in III. As for
FORMULA , it can decay much more strongly into FORMULA  than
FORMULA  as seen in III, although its production is depicted
by the same diagram Fig. 1(d) as the production of FORMULA .
Therefore, reconstruction of FORMULA 
might be suspected to be efficient to search for FORMULA . However,
very large numbers of FORMULA  and FORMULA  (from
FORMULA ) produced through the spectator
diagrams Figs. 1(a) and (b) (and in
FORMULA , etc.
without weak interactions) obscure the above signal FORMULA .
In this way, it will be understood that whether each of charm-strange
scalar mesons can be observed or not depends on its production
mechanism, and, therefore, it seems that no evidence for FORMULA 
and FORMULA  in inclusive FORMULA 
annihilation experiments does not necessarily imply their non-existence.
Because it is difficult to observe FORMULA , FORMULA 
and FORMULA  in inclusive FORMULA  experiments
as seen above, we now study productions of charm-strange scalar
four-quark mesons in FORMULA  decays. For this purpose, we again draw
quark-line diagrams describing their productions within the minimal
FORMULA -pair creation. As expected in the quark-line diagrams of
Figs. 2 and 3, resonance peaks which are approximately degenerate with
FORMULA  have been observed in the following hadronic weak
decays of FORMULA  mesons:
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
in the BELLE experiment {{cite:b3edb6ef-59d0-4dea-ba34-32b375183b91}}, and
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
in the BABAR experiment {{cite:9f6a78f6-4069-4e42-ad05-28a7fe34774f}}. It should be noted
that indications of new resonances have been observed in the
FORMULA  channel. It is quite different from the case
of inclusive FORMULA . Therefore, the new resonances
have been denoted by FORMULA [observed channel(s)] to distinguish them from the previous FORMULA . Because Figs. 2(a)
and 3(b) involve both FORMULA  and FORMULA  and their main
decays are quite different from each other, the new resonance can be assigned to FORMULA  when it is observed in the FORMULA 
channel, while it might be assigned to FORMULA  when it is observed
in the FORMULA  channel. Observations of FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are expected in the process
FORMULA 
as depicted in Fig. 2(b), and in the process
FORMULA 
as depicted in Fig. 3(a), respectively. Because the diagrams Figs. 2(a),
2(b), 3(a) and 3(b) are of the same type, rates for production of
FORMULA  and FORMULA  are expected to be not very far from
that for FORMULA , i.e.,
FORMULA 
Therefore, FORMULA  and FORMULA  could be observed in
FORMULA  decays.
FIGURE 

Summary
By studying the FORMULA  and
FORMULA  decays, we have seen that
assigning FORMULA  to FORMULA  is favored by experiments.
To search for its partners FORMULA  and FORMULA , we have
investigated productions of these four-quark mesons through hadronic
weak interactions. As the results, we have found that detecting them
in inclusive FORMULA  is likely quite difficult,
although FORMULA  itself has already been observed.
Taking these points into consideration, we have estimated the branching
fractions for decays of FORMULA  mesons producing FORMULA  and
FORMULA  as
FORMULA .
As for observation of FORMULA  and FORMULA , we conclude that
they could have been observed as resonances with approximately equal
masses in two different channels, FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
as the BELLE collaboration observed.
