We present estimates of the N-point galaxy, area-averaged, angular correlation functions FORMULA (FORMULA ) for FORMULA  = 2,...,7 for galaxies from the fifth data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Our parent sample is selected from galaxies with FORMULA , and is the largest ever used to study higher-order correlations. We subdivide this parent sample into two volume limited samples using photometric redshifts, and these two samples are further subdivided by magnitude, redshift, and color (producing early- and late-type galaxy samples) to determine the dependence of FORMULA (FORMULA ) on luminosity, redshift, and galaxy-type. We measure FORMULA (FORMULA ) using oversampling techniques and use them to calculate the projected, FORMULA . Using models derived from theoretical power-spectra and perturbation theory, we measure the bias parameters FORMULA  and FORMULA , finding that the large differences in both bias parameters (FORMULA  and FORMULA ) between early- and late-type galaxies are robust against changes in redshift, luminosity, and FORMULA , and that both terms are consistently smaller for late-type galaxies. By directly comparing their higher-order correlation measurements, we find large differences in the clustering of late-type galaxies at redshifts lower than 0.3 and those at redshifts higher than 0.3, both at large scales (FORMULA  is larger by FORMULA  at FORMULA ) and small scales (large amplitudes are measured at small scales only for FORMULA , suggesting much more merger driven star formation at FORMULA ). Finally, our measurements of FORMULA  suggest both that FORMULA  and FORMULA  is negative.
Cosmology: observational; Galaxies: clustering, environment, star formation
Introduction
An important subject in cosmology and galaxy formation is galaxy bias. Galaxies trace the underlying dark matter that shapes the Universe, but there is no guarantee that they do so faithfully. The galaxy bias defines the relationship between the clustering of dark matter and the clustering of galaxies. Ideally, the relationship between the distribution of galaxies and dark matter is simple — the ratio of the over-density of galaxies to the over-density of dark matter (i.e., the bias, hereafter FORMULA , which is measured relative to clustering dark matter) is a constant factor independent of smoothing scale and the over-density of dark matter. This ideal case is known as scale invariant linear bias. If instead FORMULA  is a function of the overdensity, it is non-linear. Significantly non-linear bias would suggest that galaxy formation is dependent on environment, as it would suggest that the efficiency of galaxy formation is dependent on halo mass (i.e., the dark matter over-density).
Assuming a non-linear bias, FORMULA  can formally be expanded into factors FORMULA  via a Taylor expansion, which reduces to linear bias when FORMULA  and FORMULA  for FORMULA . Several previoius studies have found that FORMULA  is nearly zero. {{cite:6415399d-2d85-4fd5-8a60-af6df40e9a13}} found, by studying the monopole contribution to the 2dFGRS three-point correlation function, that, for galaxies with FORMULA , FORMULA . Likewise, {{cite:439be071-aa3c-4434-9723-c38387b1b996}} found, using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic galaxy catalog to calculate the bispectrum, that FORMULA  (FORMULA ) is consistent with zero to within 10FORMULA  for FORMULA  = 0.9, however, they measure FORMULA  to be larger for smaller FORMULA . On the other hand, in an earlier study we ({{cite:c193acca-8d11-49b1-9935-7c06ff6f04ea}}, hereafter denoted Ross06) found FORMULA  via determination of the FORMULA -order angular galaxy correlations for 11 million photometrically selected galaxies from the third data release (DR3) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). {{cite:23ee1f92-6ad6-4262-ba5e-bf6995012585}} likewise found FORMULA  for FORMULA  galaxies in the 2dFGRS by calculating the redshift-space three-point correlation functions, a method that is independent of FORMULA , the rms fluctuation in the matter density averaged in a sphere of radius 8 Mpc, .
Determining FORMULA  is necessary, because, as yet, there is no clear consensus. When measured from only the third year WMAP (WMAP3) data, FORMULA  {{cite:442533e2-09ab-420d-94fe-a67938407755}}. Further constraining WMAP3 data via inflationary models, FORMULA . When combined with the SDSS power-spectrum data, however, this increases to FORMULA , and when combined with the 2dFGRS power-spectrum data it decreases to FORMULA  {{cite:442533e2-09ab-420d-94fe-a67938407755}}. Furthermore, the SDSS power spectrum by itself determines FORMULA  {{cite:6e7db2ea-80d6-4929-be6c-1a488c70866e}}. Methods that employ clusters of galaxies typically measure smaller values of FORMULA . For example, {{cite:e4deae56-b3fe-4889-b483-821f0e2ca17d}} found FORMULA  by using a cluster baryon mass function.
Independent measurements of FORMULA  and FORMULA  are not possible using correlation measurements, as FORMULA  serves as the normalization to the model power spectra one must use to determine FORMULA . The value of FORMULA , however, is not degenerate with FORMULA , as it will change the shape of correlation measurements. A novel technique to provide an independent measure of FORMULA  is to capitalize on the independence of FORMULA . By determining both FORMULA  and FORMULA , FORMULA  can be constrained. Determining the value of FORMULA  alone places loose constraints on the value of FORMULA .
Our most dramatic findings in Ross06 were that significant non-linear bias was required to explain the observed clustering of early- and late-type galaxies. The results determined that early-type galaxies' FORMULA  was larger than that of late-type galaxies by an absolute difference of 1.0FORMULA 0.13. {{cite:cc9acb0d-0e5e-4137-81fe-f5d0cf471835}} have since confirmed this measurement — that red galaxies have a higher FORMULA , via their determination of higher-order correlations in the 2dFGRS, though they found a more modest difference of 0.36FORMULA 0.17. In another study, {{cite:ca443425-e4aa-4c0a-96fa-489e24cd5493}} found a difference of closer to 0.5 when studying the bispectrum of galaxies selected from the SDSS data release 4 (DR4) spectroscopic survey. It is not surprising that differences are observed between these three studies, as each uses a different color cut to separate the red and blue samples. The existence of non-linear bias between galaxy types was first found by {{cite:390651c1-e5aa-4a23-a47e-1a7a956be3f7}}, when it was discovered that the higher-order clustering of galaxies selected by optical surveys (CfA and SSRS) differs from the clustering of galaxies selected by the infrared survey IRAS (galaxy selection in IRAS was biased towards late-type galaxies). This was confirmed by {{cite:15cf732c-73b0-42a0-8977-822a88cbd83d}} and interpreted as IRAS (and thus late-type) galaxies having a negative FORMULA  relative to optically selected galaxies.
Clearly, galaxy type affects the non-linear nature of the bias. The linear bias is also strongly dependent on galaxy type, as red, early-type, galaxies have consistently been shown to cluster more strongly (e.g., {{cite:95edb0ac-2676-4e4b-b2ef-337a0bddad6e}}, {{cite:953ecfa3-2cc3-47b6-85a9-992b945f2e0d}}, {{cite:440d85ac-a4da-4c86-8871-cba8147e0f17}}, {{cite:18d40301-5c7f-41f8-990d-3661b87c4906}}, {{cite:c193acca-8d11-49b1-9935-7c06ff6f04ea}}, {{cite:cc9acb0d-0e5e-4137-81fe-f5d0cf471835}}) than blue, late-type, galaxies. Luminosity has been shown to scale proportionally to FORMULA  (e.g., {{cite:440d85ac-a4da-4c86-8871-cba8147e0f17}}, {{cite:18d40301-5c7f-41f8-990d-3661b87c4906}}), which logically follows if one expects more luminous objects to generally be more massive. It is also likely that the properties of galaxies, and thus FORMULA , evolve over cosmic time. Therefore, a true characterization of galaxy bias, both linear and non-linear, requires quantifying any dependence on galaxy type, luminosity, and redshift.
As a result, we employ the wealth of information available from SDSS DR5 to follow-up and vastly improve our DR3 measurements on the nature of galaxy bias. Apart from Ross06, four other studies have used SDSS photometric data to calculate higher-order correlations: {{cite:abc53aa6-136d-42ed-9524-a8759eb52fb6}}, {{cite:59d69ef9-b3b0-48e1-9734-c7e2d5299f83}}, and {{cite:922223df-cb74-4251-89ae-3a5754d705ae}} measured higher-order correlations for galaxies in the SDSS Early Data Release (EDR) and found that measurements using SDSS were consistent with previous results and were free of any systematics. {{cite:29a00079-12f4-45b1-afcf-ddff97766ec1}} measured the DR1 higher-order correlations and found good agreement with simulation. The Ross06 measurements employed the largest data set ever used to calculate higher-order correlations with over 11 million galaxies from DR3. The SDSS DR5 offers an opportunity to significantly improve the DR3 results, as it offers FORMULA  more data and accurate photometric redshift catalogs complete with rest-frame absolute-magnitudes. This wealth of data enables a quantification of the dependence of the FORMULA -order correlations of galaxies on luminosity, type, and redshift.
In this paper, we, therefore, calculate and analyze the area-averaged angular FORMULA -point correlation functions using SDSS DR5 galaxies, up to seventh-order. Our methodology is explained in §3. This present work offers a significant improvement over Ross06, due to the fact that we use FORMULA  more data, extend the range of measurement by an order of magnitude, make measurements using volume limited samples, and employ improved theoretical modeling. Our main sample of galaxies is used for comparison with the Ross06 measurements, and is split into the same five subsamples as in Ross06, a process which is described in §2. The measurements made using DR5 are presented in §4, where we illustrate the superiority of DR5 over DR3. We use the SDSS DR5 PhotoZ table to create two volume limited samples, allowing us to investigate the evolution and luminosity dependence of FORMULA -order correlations in §5. Model, area-averaged correlation functions are calculated by integrating over theoretical power spectra and an appropriate redshift distribution, allowing for the calculation of first- and second-order bias parameters. In §6, we present our measurements of the higher-order (non-linear) bias and determine their dependence on galaxy-type, luminosity, and redshift.
We adopt the cosmology (FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA ) FORMULA  (0.28, 0.72, 0.7, 0.15), where FORMULA  is the shape parameter, based on recent supernovae, large-scale structure, and CMB measurements (e.g., {{cite:7d5a566b-5090-4d24-ad9d-ae74abd05146}}, {{cite:442533e2-09ab-420d-94fe-a67938407755}}, {{cite:6e278d4e-af95-4094-b39f-4dc202323049}}). This value of the shape parameter arises naturally (see, e.g., Equations 30 and 31 of {{cite:b19aadeb-63ab-4003-851c-6f553c53afe8}}) for a baryon fraction of FORMULA  (e.g., {{cite:6e278d4e-af95-4094-b39f-4dc202323049}}).

Data
The data analyzed herein were taken from the SDSS DR5 {{cite:b980954e-99e2-4f13-9e67-1de835c25d46}}. This survey obtains wide-field CCD photometry {{cite:66dc442d-4df6-4a88-a3dc-e715e5e370d6}} in five passbands (FORMULA ; e.g., {{cite:fbad72f8-165b-4ad0-97c8-667371d59d74}}). The entire DR5 represents 8000 square degrees of observing area. We selected galaxies with positions lying in the Northern, contiguous portion of the SDSS from the DR5 PhotoPrimary database, and further constrained the sample (using the {{cite:bddedf45-8f4f-420a-a46c-007dbfdbe31b}} dust maps) to have reddening-corrected magnitudes in the range FORMULA . Further, significant masking was required to account for bright stars and areas of high reddening and poor seeing (see §REF ). This produced a set of over 18 million galaxies (18,532,911) at a median redshift of about 0.31. This is by far the most galaxies used to conduct this type of measurement, and represents over a 70FORMULA  increase in the number of objects used in our previous DR3 measurements. We split this sample of galaxies into the same five sub-samples as in Ross06 (three samples constrained to the magnitude ranges FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA , and two color-selected samples defined by FORMULA  for early-type and FORMULA  for late-type galaxies). These samples are used primarily for comparison with the DR3 measurements, however, due to our improved measurement techniques, they also sample substantially smaller and larger scales than Ross06.
Creation of Volume Limited Samples
Our primary analysis is divided between two volume limited samples created following the methods outlined in {{cite:4c6b9ddc-9562-485d-9d83-38e1a57559ed}}. Galaxies with FORMULA  are taken from the DR5 PhotoZ table and matched to galaxies in the DR5 PhotoPrimary table. Using the rest-frame absolute FORMULA -band magnitudes, FORMULA , given for each galaxy in the PhotoZ table, we display the FORMULA  – FORMULA  plane in Figure REF . As can be seen, there is a definite locus that defines the limiting absolute magnitude for a given redshift. To create a volume limited catalog to a given redshift, FORMULA , we simply select galaxies with FORMULA  that are also intrinsically brighter than the limiting magnitude defined by the locus of points displayed in Figure REF . We focus our analysis on two volume limited samples that have roughly similar numbers of galaxies. One sample we take is limited to a redshift of 0.4, requiring that FORMULA . This sample, hereafter denoted as FORMULA , contains nearly three and half million galaxies (3,380,553) after masking (see §REF ). Our other volume limited sample, hereafter denoted FORMULA , is limited to a redshift of 0.3, with FORMULA , and contains nearly four million objects (3,980,652) after masking.

Methodology
Angular Correlation functions
We estimate N-point area-averaged angular correlation functions, FORMULA (FORMULA ), using a counts-in-cells technique (e.g., Ross06). This basically involves calculating the statistical moments of the over-densities contained in equal-area cells. The over-density for cell FORMULA  is defined as
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the average number of galaxies in a cell and FORMULA  is the number of galaxies in cell FORMULA . The remaining details and equations required to determine FORMULA (FORMULA ) are found in Ross06.
In a hierarchical model (e.g., {{cite:82e97630-26b0-4854-b807-fbd1ebb7899c}}, {{cite:c26ad9e9-eca3-4978-beb7-f5ed666c38fe}}, {{cite:1a7fb1e2-fed1-4ac1-8e6c-91d3be66b0c3}}), higher-order correlations can be expressed in terms of the two-point correlation function, and the volume-averaged correlations are given by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the hierarchical amplitude. In a similar manner, we can define the analogous relationship for the area-averaged angular correlations
FORMULA 
The hierarchical amplitudes of the higher-order moments encode much of the pertinent information on the distribution of the data. These amplitudes, therefore, embody the central analysis of this paper.

Redshift Distributions
In order to compare angular measurements to theoretical models, it is necessary to determine FORMULA , which we accomplish using the galaxies' photometric redshifts (see §2.1). We construct FORMULA  by using each published redshift and its error (rejecting any with error greater than twenty percent) to create a probability density function (PDF). The PDFs for each redshift are combined to produce the expected number of objects (FORMULA ) in a redshift bin of width 0.001. This distribution is then normalized and interpolated over in order to estimate FORMULA . For SDSS galaxies with FORMULA , the resulting normalized FORMULA  is plotted in Figure REF . The distribution of FORMULA  is smooth and roughly Gaussian. For all subsamples (volume limited and otherwise, see §2), we likewise use the corresponding DR5 photometric redshifts to obtain estimates of their individual redshift selection functions.

Pixelization
The pixelization schemes we employ are nearly identical to those used in Ross06. Basically, we reimplemented the SDSSpix pixelization scheme originally developed by Tegmark, Xu, and Scrantonhttp://lahmu.phyast.pitt.edu/FORMULA scranton/SDSSPix/, as described in detail in Ross06. Increased computing resources have allowed efficient usage of SDSSpix at smaller scales, allowing us to make measurements for FORMULA . The striped method (see Ross06) is again employed, but only for scales between 0.005 and 0.04 degrees (we note that we are able to probe smaller scales than in Ross06).
For larger angular scales an oversampling technique (e.g., {{cite:922223df-cb74-4251-89ae-3a5754d705ae}}) is applied such that every angular scale uses the same number of data cells. Using the base resolution pixels produced by SDSSpix, we can make cells equivalent to any angular scale FORMULA  at every single base pixel (where FORMULA  is any integer greater than or equal to 2 and FORMULA  is the angular scale at the base resolution). Thus, at a large scale the cells are highly overlapping, allowing more information to be extracted, which allows for more precise calculations at large scales. We therefore perform calculations for FORMULA . We have verified that the results using the striped method are consistent with using this oversampling implementation at scales between 0.02 and 0.1 degrees. From here on, we will refer to the method used for small angular scales as the striped method and to the method for large angular scales as the oversampling method. Oversampling increases the covariance, but this is not a problem since we perform a full covariance analysis for all parameters we attempt to measure.

Errors and Covariance
We compute errors and covariance matrices using a jackknife method (e.g., {{cite:fda73362-cf4e-484e-a718-45b4dbc66aae}}), with inverse-variance weighting for both errors (e.g., {{cite:ccfabba4-06d4-4de0-a60f-dfe3b2820648}}, {{cite:c539fdc5-5917-496d-89b2-4cbebc116bf9}}) and covariance (e.g., {{cite:16e17713-8c13-4532-807c-21bdf256731e}}), nearly identical to the method described in detail in Ross06. The jackknife method works by creating many subsamples of the entire data set, each with a small part of the total area removed. For the striped method, we utilize the natural geometry of the SDSS. Each of the 29 different stripes in the DR5 forms a natural subset of the overall data. The covariance matrix is calculated using each of the possible subsamples of DR5 that is made up of 28 stripes. For the angular scales that are calculated by the striped method, we find that these 29 subsamples are sufficient to create a stable covariance matrix. For the larger angular scales probed by the oversampling method, we find that 20 jack-knife subsamplings are sufficient to create a stable covariance matrix. These 20 subsamples are created by simply eliminating a contiguous grouping of 1/20th of the unmasked pixels in 20 separate areas. To properly constrain fit parameters, we minimize the FORMULA  using our covariance matrixes via
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the covariance matrix and FORMULA  and FORMULA  refer to the FORMULA  and FORMULA  jackknife subsample.

Masks
We will generally refer to useful observational information (such as seeing and Galactic extinction values) across each pixel in our schema (see §REF ) as forming a mask of that information. The DR5 area required significant masking which we performed in the same manner as in Ross06. Pixels at the base resolution are discarded if they intersect the standard SDSS imaging mask, have a mean reddening FORMULA , have a mean seeing greater than 1.FORMULA 5, or intersect the Ross06 mask for galaxy M101. Cells at scales above the base resolution have their over-densities corrected for the fractional area of the pixel in the same manner as in Ross06, thus
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the fractional area of cell FORMULA . As before, we did not find any systematic variation in correlation measurements as a function of stripe.

Area-averaged Correlation Functions and Hierarchical Amplitudes: Complete Sample
Figure REF  shows the area-averaged correlation functions for FORMULA  determined for galaxies with FORMULA . Errors for each point were determined by the jackknife method (see Ross06). Compared to the Ross06 results, we now sample at more angular scales, and the maximum and minimum angles are extended, resulting in an extra order of magnitude in angular coverage. For each FORMULA , the correlation function has a shape roughly consistent with a power-law to about 0.3FORMULA . At larger scales, there exist obvious features that are not adequately represented by a power law. Looking at FORMULA , a power-law representation appears as if it may be appropriate to 1FORMULA . Assuming a form FORMULA , the FORMULA  best fit for FORMULA  over the angular range FORMULA  is FORMULA  and FORMULA . These results are consistent with previous measurements (see, e.g., {{cite:1a7fb1e2-fed1-4ac1-8e6c-91d3be66b0c3}}, {{cite:566362a7-55b8-40c5-aa75-0edf1e686cba}}, {{cite:09a4a176-ee26-4639-a39d-347756320301}}, Ross06). The FORMULA  value is 433.6, however, meaning that a power-law form is inappropriate over these scales. In order to produce fits that are not rejected, fits must be performed over ranges that are less than half a dex. We caution, therefore that our power-law measurement is useful only for comparison purposes.
The hierarchical amplitudes FORMULA  for FORMULA  measured in magnitude ranges FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA  are shown in Figure REF . Compared to the results of Ross06, the measurements made at scales greater than one degree are far more significant, but overall the measurements are quite consistent. We also probe smaller scales, showing that at scales less than 0.02FORMULA  the FORMULA  measured for FORMULA  increase as the angular scales decreases.
As in Ross06, we employ the simple color criteria determined by {{cite:6dad06d2-4d6b-43b6-9a12-e5569b3ba5ed}} to separate early-type (FORMULA ) and late-type (FORMULA ) galaxies from SDSS photometric data. Using this color cut and the magnitude restriction FORMULA , we separate our sample into early- and late-type galaxies and repeat our N-point measurements for these two samples. We find that DR5 contains about 25% more late-type galaxies (10,284,575) than early-type galaxies (8,248,336), which is nearly the same proportions as in Ross06.
Figures REF  and REF  show the results of the FORMULA  and FORMULA  measurements for early- and late-type galaxies. The early-type galaxies clearly show stronger clustering at scales FORMULA , in agreement with previous results (e.g., {{cite:95edb0ac-2676-4e4b-b2ef-337a0bddad6e}}, {{cite:4762d62d-a1a9-413f-b3ab-b40a39a70e1a}}, {{cite:953ecfa3-2cc3-47b6-85a9-992b945f2e0d}}, {{cite:440d85ac-a4da-4c86-8871-cba8147e0f17}}), but at large scales (FORMULA  5FORMULA ), the amplitudes are nearly equal. This suggests that their respective bias might be scale dependent (see §REF ). In Ross06 we were not able to probe such large scales, otherwise our overall results remain consistent. The correlation functions display roughly power-law behavior for all FORMULA , but there is significant structure that becomes more pronounced as FORMULA  grows. The FORMULA  of the late-type galaxies show smaller amplitudes for FORMULA , suggesting that higher-order bias terms are significant. At the largest scales (FORMULA  2FORMULA ), FORMULA  and FORMULA  appear nearly identical for early- and late-types, yet in this regime, the errors begin to dominate the measurements.
As found in Ross06, the late-type correlation measurements show extremely interesting behavior. At angular scales between 0.01FORMULA  and 0.1FORMULA  the late-type galaxies exhibit slopes that increase as the scale decreases. Probing smaller scales, this relationship appears to turn over, as evidenced by the FORMULA  measured at FORMULA  0.02FORMULA . For FORMULA  6 and 7, there is a dramatic loss of signal at angular scales greater than 0.2FORMULA . A similar loss in signal is shared by the correlation measurements made by using all galaxies, but the measurements made by using early-type galaxies do not show this dramatic loss of signal. This suggests that there is an intrinsic property of late-type galaxy clustering that is so strong it dominates the measurement for FORMULA  6.
The DR5 PhotoZ table contains estimates of spectral type, given by a number between 0 and 1, where 0 is most red and 1 is most blue. It has been shown (e.g., {{cite:4c6b9ddc-9562-485d-9d83-38e1a57559ed}}) that splitting the sample of galaxies into early- and late-type galaxies at a type value of 0.3 (hereafter denoted the photo sample) is roughly equivalent to splitting them using the {{cite:6dad06d2-4d6b-43b6-9a12-e5569b3ba5ed}} color criteria (hereafter denoted the color sample). To test this, we split the entire sample into early- and late-type galaxies by photo and compare the resulting correlation functions to those measured for galaxies split by color. The results for FORMULA  are displayed in Figure REF . While the two cuts produce similar results, there are some significant differences. It appears that the characteristic rise at small scales for late-type galaxies is actually more prevalent in the galaxies split by the photo method. This suggests that type confusion when splitting the galaxies by the color method (which would be expected to be greatest at higher redshift) may dampen the overall signal of late-type galaxies selected this way. To minimize any type confusion, therefore, when we split our galaxy sample by redshift, their types will be determined via the photo method, as these types should be less sensitive to redshift than the color method (see §REF  for further justification).

Higher-Order Correlations in Volume Limited Samples
  FORMULA
The volume limited sample FORMULA  contains roughly four million galaxies with FORMULA . We split this sample into fifteen different subsamples (though each is not mutually exclusive). The sample is split by magnitude into two groups: FORMULA  and FORMULA , and by redshift into two groups: FORMULA  and FORMULA . Each group itself contains three groups: early-type, late-type, and all-types, where the split is done by using the photo method.
Figure REF  displays the FORMULA  measurements made using all-, late-, and early-type galaxies in the FORMULA  volume limited sample. Immediately, one notices that the late-type galaxies do not resemble the late-type galaxy measurements made on the full sample, especially at smaller scales. The late-type galaxies also display larger error bars than the early-type galaxies, despite the fact that there are nearly the same number of late-type (1,984,021) galaxies and early-type galaxies (1,996,631) in this sample. The early-type galaxies show significantly higher amplitudes than the late-type galaxies, and the difference is largest at FORMULA 0.1FORMULA , just as in the full sample of galaxies.
For each subset of galaxies (all, late, and early) the amplitudes for the full sample are slightly larger than those of FORMULA . This suggests that the bias is slightly larger in the FORMULA  sample than in the full sample, as FORMULA . This is not surprising, as the full sample contains less luminous galaxies than FORMULA , and bias is known to increase with luminosity (e.g., {{cite:440d85ac-a4da-4c86-8871-cba8147e0f17}}, {{cite:18d40301-5c7f-41f8-990d-3661b87c4906}}). The bias measurements for each sample are calculated in the following section.
Figure REF  displays the FORMULA  and FORMULA  measurements made by separating the FORMULA  galaxies by luminosity into two groups, FORMULA  and FORMULA . These measurements for all-, late-, and early-type galaxies are shown in the bottom, middle and top panels, respectively. For each galaxy type, the shapes of FORMULA  for brighter galaxies are quite similar to the fainter galaxies. The largest difference is that the amplitudes are higher for the fainter galaxies, which is consistent with the first-order bias increasing with luminosity. Based solely on Figure REF , it does not appear that non-linear clustering (i.e., FORMULA , FORMULA ) is dependent on luminosity, as the differences in the amplitudes appear consistent with a linear bias model (see §6, Table ).
In order to test for evolution, FORMULA  is split by redshift into a FORMULA  and FORMULA  sample. Figure REF  shows this split for all-, late-, and early-type galaxies in the bottom, middle and top panels, respectively. After accounting for the fact that that the galaxies with FORMULA  probe scales that are about 1.6 times larger (based on median redshifts of 0.26 and 0.15) than the FORMULA  galaxies, the shapes of the FORMULA  are quite similar to a physical scale of about 5 FORMULA  Mpc (FORMULA 0.06FORMULA  for FORMULA , FORMULA 0.04 for FORMULA ). Despite the visual differences, there does not appear to be significant evolution in the bias, as the differences in the measurements can be explained by the differences in the physical scales.
One concern with the volume limited samples we create is the possible effects of photometric redshift errors on the creation of our samples. To quantify any potential bias, we created ten separate samples where instead of taking the stated photometric redshift of each galaxy, we sampled its probability-density-function (PDF) given by its one FORMULA  error, thereby assigning a new redshift for each galaxy. This allowed us to created ten separate samples with the same magnitude and redshift limits as FORMULA . Figure REF  displays the average measured FORMULA  of these samples, with errors (in bold black) calculated by finding the standard deviation of the ten measurements. Underneath these points, the jackknife errors of the FORMULA  sample are plotted in light red. It is clear that the normal jackknife errors dominate the error budget, especially at larger scales where the errors are most important for fitting bias values. Therefore, we conclude that photometric redshift errors should not make any significant difference in our results.

  FORMULA
The volume limited sample FORMULA  contains just under three and a half million galaxies with FORMULA  and FORMULA . Figure REF  shows the FORMULA  measurements for all-, late-, and early-type galaxies in FORMULA , split using the photo method. Their shapes are quite similar to the measurements made on the full sample. The FORMULA  sample, however, shows a strong rise at small-scales in FORMULA  for late-types, unlike the FORMULA  sample. The error bars on the late-type galaxies are again larger that those of the early-type galaxies, but in this case it can be explained by the fact that there are significantly fewer late-type galaxies (1,325,488 late-types; 2,055,065 early-types).
Splitting FORMULA  into two redshift bins, FORMULA  (1,302,750 galaxies) and FORMULA  (2,077,803 galaxies) produces extremely interesting results. Figure REF  shows the FORMULA  measured in these redshift bins for all-, late-, and early-type galaxies in the bottom, middle, and top panels, respectively. For each galaxy-type, the FORMULA  are much closer to constant at the lower redshift. For the late-type galaxies, the errors are much larger at small scales for the low redshift bin. This is due to the fact that there are nearly 75% more high-redshift late-type (843,527) galaxies than low redshift (481,961). Low redshift, late-type galaxies have a weak signal at small scales, while the high redshift galaxies have a relatively strong signal, meaning that, in the full sample, the high redshift signal dominates. This explains the small-scale features seen in the full FORMULA  sample of late-type galaxies.
The late-type galaxies can be further split by their type. Separating the galaxies with type values greater than 0.3 at a type value of 0.65 produces a sample of galaxies that corresponds roughly to late-type spirals (FORMULA ; denoted FORMULA  hereafter) and one that corresponds roughly to irregular galaxies (FORMULA ; denoted FORMULA  hereafter; {{cite:4c6b9ddc-9562-485d-9d83-38e1a57559ed}}). Figure REF  shows the measured FORMULA  and FORMULA  for FORMULA  (closed symbols) and FORMULA  (open symbols) for FORMULA . The rise in the amplitudes at small scales is much stronger for the FORMULA  galaxies, which we interpret as evidence that the small scale rise correlates with star formation in dense environments, which we discuss further in §REF .

Comparison of Full Sample to Volume Limited
By comparing the FORMULA  measurements made on the full sample to those made on the volume limited samples, features in the full sample of galaxies are isolated in the redshift/luminosity plane. The most obvious conclusion is that the measurements of late-type galaxies are dominated by galaxies with FORMULA , especially on angular scales smaller than half a degree, as the FORMULA  signal is much stronger at FORMULA  for late-types. For early-types, the shapes of FORMULA  measured in all subsamples are consistent both with each other and with the measurement of early-type galaxies drawn from the full sample.
For many of the subsamples, there appears to be a feature at FORMULA 2FORMULA . This is especially true for all galaxy types in the main sample of galaxies and for early-type galaxies with FORMULA  and FORMULA . It is quite prevalent for all galaxy types with FORMULA  and is strangely not present for galaxies with FORMULA . A close inspection of the feature reveals that it actually occurs at slightly different angular scales in the different redshift shells. Figure REF  shows FORMULA  measured for early-type galaxies in the FORMULA  redshift bin from FORMULA  (red circles) and the FORMULA  redshift bin of FORMULA  (black triangles). These are the ideal samples to compare, as they represent the largest difference in physical scale. The left panel shows the two measurements plotted on an angular scale, while the right panel plots FORMULA  against the equivalent physical scale (based on their median redshifts of 0.154 and 0.355). When the two measurements are plotted against their equivalent scale, the match is much better. This suggests that the feature is physical in nature and is characterized by a minima at 10 FORMULA Mpc. While this scale is interesting as it marks the transition from the non-linear to linear regime, the error bars preclude us from drawing any profound conclusions.
Figure REF  suggested that separating early- and late-type galaxies via the color method may break down at higher redshifts. Figure REF  displays the same information as Figure REF , with galaxy-type determined via the color method instead of the photo method. The measurements for FORMULA  are nearly identical to those measured splitting by the photo method, but for FORMULA  the results are quite different, for both the early- and late-type galaxies. This suggests that for FORMULA , the color method cannot adequately distinguish between early- and late-type galaxies, and justifies our preference for separating galaxy type based on the photo method.

Bias Measurements
There is no guarantee that galaxies cluster with the same amplitude as the dark matter they trace. Indeed, it has often been shown that galaxies display different clustering amplitudes when separated by luminosity or type (e.g., {{cite:15cf732c-73b0-42a0-8977-822a88cbd83d}}, {{cite:95edb0ac-2676-4e4b-b2ef-337a0bddad6e}}, {{cite:953ecfa3-2cc3-47b6-85a9-992b945f2e0d}}, {{cite:440d85ac-a4da-4c86-8871-cba8147e0f17}}, {{cite:18d40301-5c7f-41f8-990d-3661b87c4906}}, {{cite:c193acca-8d11-49b1-9935-7c06ff6f04ea}}, {{cite:cc9acb0d-0e5e-4137-81fe-f5d0cf471835}}). The simplest model for this difference is the linear bias model. In this model, the overdensity of galaxies is a linear function of the overdensity of dark matter:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  denotes galaxy, FORMULA  denotes dark matter, and FORMULA  is the linear bias factor. In this approximation, one finds the simple relationship that
FORMULA 
It has been shown, however (e.g., {{cite:15cf732c-73b0-42a0-8977-822a88cbd83d}}, {{cite:23ee1f92-6ad6-4262-ba5e-bf6995012585}}, {{cite:c193acca-8d11-49b1-9935-7c06ff6f04ea}}, {{cite:cc9acb0d-0e5e-4137-81fe-f5d0cf471835}}), that linear bias may not be a good approximation. One can represent the relationship between overdensities more generally, such that the measured overdensity is some function of the dark matter overdensity. As such, the relationship can be expanded into a Taylor series {{cite:15cf732c-73b0-42a0-8977-822a88cbd83d}}:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the FORMULA th order bias term. Thus it follows that if non-linear bias is important, a measurement of the linear bias will increase as the overdensities increase (i.e., as the scale gets smaller) and the non-linear terms (i.e., any FORMULA  for FORMULA ) grow in importance. When FORMULA ,FORMULA  can be determined via Equation REF , as higher order terms will be negligible.
First-Order Bias Measurements
In order to find FORMULA , one must first determine the scales at which higher-order terms make a negligible contribution to FORMULA . This can be done by calculating FORMULA , incorporating a second-order bias term, and comparing it to the FORMULA  calculated normally. To second order, the dark matter over-density can be expressed (via trivial manipulation of Equation REF ) as
FORMULA 
Thus, when calculating FORMULA , if Equation REF  is used to correct the measured overdensities in each cell, a measurement is returned that assumes a first and second order bias. If the first-order bias is set to 1 and a reasonable second-order bias is applied, the resulting measurement will begin to deviate significantly from the standard measurement when the second order effects become important. Based on previous measurements {{cite:23ee1f92-6ad6-4262-ba5e-bf6995012585}}, {{cite:c193acca-8d11-49b1-9935-7c06ff6f04ea}}, we select -0.3 as a reasonable value to use. Figure REF  shows the ratio of FORMULA  calculated with this value to FORMULA  calculated in the standard way, using the sample of galaxies from FORMULA  with FORMULA . The ratio grows significantly greater than 1 for FORMULA , corresponding to a physical scale of about 8FORMULA Mpc. This is right where one would expect non-linear effects to become important, as it marks the generally accepted transition to the weakly linear regime. As a result, we calculate the first order bias for scales where the corresponding physical scale (FORMULA ) is greater than 8FORMULA Mpc.
Calculating the bias requires knowing FORMULA . Of course this is not directly measurable, so we must resort to using a theoretical model. {{cite:c9132c96-0dc4-499f-85be-d1b6c5902634}} have derived fitting formulae based on FORMULA -body simulations, which produce matter power-spectra when given specific input cosmological parameters. By using a modified version of Limber's equation {{cite:88631e4a-28ea-4c86-9da3-9c1b02a7cc52}}, one can use the appropriate redshift distribution to invert the FORMULA  to obtain FORMULA :
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the top-hat two-dimensional window function, FORMULA  is the survey depth (determined by the median redshift), FORMULA  is the matter power spectra, FORMULA  is the spectral index, and FORMULA  is the first-order Bessel function of the first kind. In a flat universe, FORMULA , and FORMULA , simplifying Equation 10 to:
FORMULA 
This integral was numerically determined with our assumed cosmology and fixing the value of FORMULA  for the matter FORMULA  to 0.8. Following this procedure, model FORMULA  were produced for each subsample studied, using the appropriate redshift distribution. Finally, the first order bias was calculated by using the covariance matrix at scales FORMULA Mpc. We note that this approach is much more accurate than the methods employed in Ross06, which inverted the measurements to real-space, required FORMULA  be a power-law, calculated only the relative bias, and were insensitive to any changes in the bias as a function of scale.
Tables  and  display our calculated FORMULA  values for all of the measurements made using the volume-limited samples FORMULA  and FORMULA . The most important information can be summarized as follows: (1) for FORMULA , there is no significant evolution in FORMULA  as a function of redshift for any galaxy type, but there is significant evolution seen in FORMULA  and it is most dramatic for the late-type galaxies; (2) FORMULA  grows larger with luminosity, independent of galaxy type; and (3) FORMULA  is consistently larger for early-type galaxies, though the ratio of FORMULA  to FORMULA  is larger for FORMULA . The determined luminosity and type dependences of FORMULA  are consistent with the general results of previous findings ({{cite:15cf732c-73b0-42a0-8977-822a88cbd83d}}, {{cite:95edb0ac-2676-4e4b-b2ef-337a0bddad6e}}, {{cite:953ecfa3-2cc3-47b6-85a9-992b945f2e0d}}, {{cite:440d85ac-a4da-4c86-8871-cba8147e0f17}}, {{cite:18d40301-5c7f-41f8-990d-3661b87c4906}}, {{cite:c193acca-8d11-49b1-9935-7c06ff6f04ea}}, {{cite:cc9acb0d-0e5e-4137-81fe-f5d0cf471835}}). All of the determined values are dependent on the true value of FORMULA . Since all of the models use FORMULA , the true values of the FORMULA  are FORMULA , where FORMULA  are the measured values reported in Tables  and .
Most of the fits to FORMULA  using the FORMULA  sample minimize FORMULA  such that it is approximately one or smaller per degree of freedom (DOF), meaning most fits favor a scale invariant FORMULA  over the fitted range. The notable exception is the measurement for late-type galaxies with FORMULA , with a FORMULA  per DOF value of nearly two. The fits to FORMULA  for FORMULA  are in general worse than those of FORMULA . All but two have fits with FORMULA  per DOF greater than one. It is thus unlikely that FORMULA  is scale invariant at higher redshifts, a fact which must be taken into account when calculating higher-order bias terms.

Second-Order Bias Measurements
In order to measure the second order bias, we use the equation {{cite:15cf732c-73b0-42a0-8977-822a88cbd83d}}:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA . This equation was derived for real-space hierarchical amplitudes, but given a theoretical FORMULA , FORMULA  can be determined in the same way from FORMULA . Using PT, an expression valid in the weakly non-linear regime can be derived for FORMULA  {{cite:b179c7ca-590a-440e-a227-5f337160967c}}:
FORMULA 
From Equation 3, it is clear that FORMULA  can be obtained by dividing this FORMULA  by FORMULA . Equation 13 uses PT, which means that a linear power spectrum must be used when calculating FORMULA , and it is only valid at scales with FORMULA Mpc. Using the model FORMULA  and FORMULA  calculated at each scale (allowing for any scale dependence in FORMULA ), one can calculate FORMULA  at each scale and thus construct its covariance matrix and determine the FORMULA  best-fit average values (see §REF ) of FORMULA  for each subsample. Once again, we note that this method is superior to the one employed by Ross06, as it has been shown (e.g. {{cite:0db1483f-15f5-4010-878f-1196f7249d59}}, {{cite:2afb2816-d996-437a-9f66-637a0522e324}}) that this method is a better match to simulations than assuming a hierarchy and inverting FORMULA  to real-space.
The values of FORMULA  for the FORMULA  and FORMULA  samples are presented in the right hand columns of Tables  and . The important aspects are as follows: (1) as first seen in Ross06, the FORMULA  values for late-type galaxies are significantly lower than those of early-type galaxies; (2) early-type galaxies have a value of FORMULA  that is independent of both luminosity and redshift; and (3) FORMULA  varies slightly with luminosity and evolves significantly between redshifts of 0.3 and 0.4, which we explore in §REF . The FORMULA  per DOF for all but three measurements are less than 1.24. The three exceptions are for measurements drawn from samples of early-type galaxies, and the poor fits are largely due to the strength in the feature at 10 FORMULA Mpc. To the limit on our data, one would expect most measurements can be fit by a constant FORMULA  , as the errors on the FORMULA  measurements over the fit ranges are typically large.

Discussion
FORMULA  vs.  FORMULA
The relationship between FORMULA  and FORMULA  is more complicated than for the first-order bias. Given that our measured FORMULA  are calculated using FORMULA  for the matter FORMULA , it can be shown that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the true FORMULA . Since FORMULA  is not constant, the difference between FORMULA  and FORMULA  is not constant either. Thus, it is possible to perform a two parameter fit on the values of FORMULA  and FORMULA , thereby placing loose constraints on FORMULA . Figure REF  shows the one FORMULA  allowed regions of parameter space for FORMULA  and FORMULA  for all- (black), early- (red), and late-type (blue) galaxies in the FORMULA  volume limited sample. Clearly, there is a large spread in the allowed values of FORMULA  even if one constrains FORMULA  (changing FORMULA  from 0.7 to 0.9 decreases FORMULA  by about 0.6 for all galaxies type). It is clear that a significant difference in the FORMULA  of early- and late-type galaxies is robust against changes in FORMULA , as increasing FORMULA  has only a slight effect, (the difference is 1.0 for FORMULA  and it is 1.1 for FORMULA ). Thus, irrespective of FORMULA , there is clear evidence for non-linear bias differences between early- and late-type galaxies.
Focusing on the FORMULA  sample of all galaxy types, if we set FORMULA  we constrain the value of FORMULA  to be in the range 0.64+0.04/-0.03. This is inconsistent at the one FORMULA  level with the WMAP3 best-fit parameters (FORMULA ) but consistent with the one FORMULA  lower bound on WMAP3 as constrained by inflationary models (e.g, FORMULA ). On the other hand, it is highly at odds with the typical effect of combining WMAP3 and large-scale structure constraints, which tend to higher values of FORMULA . We would contend that these higher values of FORMULA  may be inconsistent with linear theory, as our data suggest FORMULA , for all galaxies, deviates by more than two FORMULA  from zero for FORMULA . If we instead set FORMULA , as found by {{cite:23ee1f92-6ad6-4262-ba5e-bf6995012585}}, FORMULA  — nearly identical to the WMAP3-SDSS combined measurement. Thus, considering that it is both unlikely that FORMULA  is greatly negative and that it is unlikely that FORMULA  is less than 0.68, we contend that the best interpretation of our results is that FORMULA  is at least slightly negative and that FORMULA .
With the methods employed in this paper, it is not possible to break the degeneracy between the bias parameters and FORMULA . It may be possible, however, using measurements similar to those presented herein. When we tested the effects of FORMULA  on the calculation of FORMULA , we created a way in which one could compare a FORMULA  measurement `corrected' for FORMULA  to a model FORMULA  and thus test whether or not a particular value of FORMULA  was a good fit. In principle, one could calculate FORMULA , varying the input value of FORMULA , to find a FORMULA  best-fit value of FORMULA . This best fit value of FORMULA  would be independent of FORMULA , as FORMULA  affects the shape of FORMULA , and FORMULA  affects only the normalization. Such an effort would require significant computational resources, and would certainly be prohibitive on the twenty-four separate subsamples we studied. Endeavoring to such a task using a sample that probes large volumes with minimal shot noise and precise photometric redshift estimations, such as the luminous red galaxies (LRGs), is more feasible (Ross et. al. 2007, in preparation).

FORMULA  vs.  FORMULA
Recent studies have found a relationship between FORMULA  and FORMULA . {{cite:23ee1f92-6ad6-4262-ba5e-bf6995012585}} suggested the relationship FORMULA . {{cite:ca443425-e4aa-4c0a-96fa-489e24cd5493}} measured results consistent with this relationship, and they showed that FORMULA 's dependence on FORMULA  is physically motivated. The major difference between these studies and ours is that we use galaxies over a much larger redshift range. Thus, we must determine if the theoretical relationship between FORMULA  and FORMULA  is robust against changes in redshift.
Following the methods of {{cite:ca443425-e4aa-4c0a-96fa-489e24cd5493}}, it is possible to calculate the first- and second-order bias parameters using a simple HOD model where the mean number of galaxies in a halo of mass FORMULA  is given by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA  are free parameters and in general are fit such that this HOD model reproduces the measured clustering. Given this HOD model, the bias parameter FORMULA  is given by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the mass function of halos with mass FORMULA  at redshift FORMULA  determined via an ellipsoidal collapse model (e.g., {{cite:4155b70c-e390-4bf9-9897-2270e23a4542}}) and FORMULA  is the FORMULA th-order bias coefficient of halos. We calculate both factors following the methods described in detail in {{cite:ca443425-e4aa-4c0a-96fa-489e24cd5493}}, but with FORMULA  so that we can compare with the calculated bias with our bias measurements (made assuming FORMULA ). We adopt the fit parameters of {{cite:18d40301-5c7f-41f8-990d-3661b87c4906}} determined for FORMULA  (logFORMULA  = 11.76, logFORMULA , FORMULA ) and FORMULA  (logFORMULA  = 12.30, logFORMULA , FORMULA ) for our HOD models which we use to calculate FORMULA  and FORMULA  at the median redshifts of the different subsamples.
In Figure REF  we display our calculated and measured FORMULA  and FORMULA , where the open green circles are the calculated values, black solid (all-), red dotted (early-), and blue dashed (late-type) crosses denote all of the measured values, and the three lines represent FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA . Using the HOD fits of {{cite:18d40301-5c7f-41f8-990d-3661b87c4906}} does not predict a strong relationship between FORMULA  and FORMULA . Changing the redshift weakly affects the calculated bias parameters, as the results show a significant change only when the HOD parameters are changed (the three calculations for FORMULA  are hardly distinguishable, as are the three calculations for FORMULA ). Comparing these results to each of our measured FORMULA  values for all galaxy types, the calculated values are consistent, though they are all greater than the measured values. (The agreement is stronger if one considers that changing FORMULA  will shift the values around.) Both the late-and all-type galaxies appear consistent with FORMULA  being linearly dependent on FORMULA , but the early-type galaxies FORMULA  measurements show no clear dependence on FORMULA . Our basic modeling suggests that there is nothing unusual about the relationship between FORMULA  and FORMULA  for early-type galaxies. It further suggests that for each galaxy-type there is redshift evolution of the HOD for a given luminosity.

Late-type Galaxies
The measurements made for late-type galaxies are significantly different for FORMULA  than for FORMULA  (e.g., Figure REF ). The rise in correlation amplitudes at small scales, first reported by Ross06, happens only for FORMULA . This suggests that late-type galaxies become much more likely to exist in close groupings at redshifts greater than 0.3. We are essentially measuring a preponderance of star forming galaxies in tight configurations as the redshift grows larger than 0.3. This in turn suggests that merger driven star formation becomes common at FORMULA . This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that the bluest galaxies (FORMULA ) at FORMULA  display the largest amplitudes at small scales (see Figure REF ), meaning that the galaxies with the most star formation are most likely to be found in tight groupings.
This picture is broadly consistent with the concept of downsizing (e.g., {{cite:307ecb9e-139f-4040-b7a4-96f92da7af88}}), which essentially states that higher-mass galaxies form stars earlier and more quickly than lower mass galaxies. The galaxies included in the volume limited samples are relatively bright (FORMULA ), and thus we find evidence of a preponderance of merger driven star formation only for FORMULA . Our interpretation is supported by the results of {{cite:1f3c4aa9-d583-4526-a196-bda797208153}} who found that star formation peaked between a redshift of 0.3 and 0.8, using the fossil records of local SDSS galaxies. Further, they found the star formation rate to be a strong function of galaxy mass, implying that, for FORMULA , there is little star formation at low redshift (this is supported by the dearth of late-type galaxies in the volume limited samples at FORMULA  in our current analysis). This interpretation is further supported by recent results from the Cosmic Evolution Survey {{cite:d2968c63-6490-4d3c-8a52-f55c96121a91}}, which found dramatically smaller star formation rates for galaxies FORMULA  than for galaxies FORMULA .
The implications of FORMULA  being significantly smaller than that of early-type galaxies can be explained physically (see Tables 1 and 2). As the over-density of dark matter increases, the over-density of late-type galaxies becomes a smaller percentage of the dark matter over-density. This is not a surprise, as the well-known morphology-density relationship {{cite:343fb93e-119e-4ddc-8b8b-0204c592bb70}} tells us that the centers of clusters (i.e., the most over-dense regions) are filled with a smaller percentage of late-type galaxies than the outskirts of the clusters. It naturally follows that late-type galaxies will have a smaller value of FORMULA  than early-type galaxies. In terms of a halo occupation distribution (HOD), one would expect the fraction of late-type galaxies to decrease with the mass of the host dark matter halo, which is the general trend recently determined by {{cite:18d40301-5c7f-41f8-990d-3661b87c4906}}.
For FORMULA , FORMULA  is much closer to FORMULA  than any of the measurements made at lower redshift (see Tables 1 and 2). This suggests that at higher redshift, the fraction of red galaxies as a function of density should display a shallower slope than at low redshift. This is observed by {{cite:db3f2ccf-aed2-4510-95a5-95efeac0f1bd}}, as for galaxies with FORMULA , the slope in this relationship is on average smaller for galaxies with FORMULA  than for galaxies with FORMULA . While these redshift ranges are different than the ones we employ, it confirms that the fraction of red galaxies versus density relationship shows a decrease in slope as the redshift increases (for FORMULA ). This is in line with the results of {{cite:44e28564-ee5a-4f5b-8d2d-90885e9b4291}}, who found that at redshifts FORMULA  0.5 the fraction of spiral galaxies in clusters is 2-3 times larger than in local clusters and that the spirals at higher redshift essentially replace the S0 fraction. It is thus likely that the increase in FORMULA  at FORMULA  is due to cluster spirals that have yet to evolve into S0 galaxies. At smaller redshifts, the spirals have likely evolved into S0 galaxies. Galaxies that we classify as late-type are therefore unlikely to be found in dense environments at low redshift, and thus FORMULA  is significantly smaller for FORMULA  than for FORMULA .

Conclusions
The results presented in this paper represent the most complete and accurate determination of the FORMULA -th order correlations of photometrically selected galaxies. The measurements and the theoretical modeling used to interpret the measurements represent a significant improvement over the Ross06 measurements. Taking all SDSS galaxies with FORMULA  and measuring FORMULA  produces extremely interesting results, but it is only through volume limiting the sample and splitting by type, redshift, and luminosity that we are able to analyze the subtle effects that produce the measurements displayed for all galaxies. In doing so, we are able to quantify the nature of linear and non-linear clustering, and its dependence on type, redshift, and luminosity.
We find that the linear bias parameter FORMULA  is smaller for late-type galaxies than for early-type galaxies, a result that is robust against changes in redshift and luminosity, but the ratio of FORMULA  to FORMULA  does vary between 1.2 and 1.5 depending on the specific redshift/luminosity bin. We confirm that FORMULA  increases proportional to luminosity, as found in many previous studies. Significant evolution appears to occur in galaxies between a redshift of 0.3 and 0.4 as there is a large increase in FORMULA  going between galaxies with FORMULA  and FORMULA  but no significant change in FORMULA  between FORMULA  0.2 and FORMULA  0.3.
The second-order bias, parameterized by FORMULA , is significantly smaller for late- than early-types, and this is robust against any changes in the luminosity, redshift, or FORMULA . This relationship between the non-linear bias of early- and late-type galaxies can be seen as a rigorous statistical restatement of the density-morphology relationship and agrees with the results of the HOD analysis by {{cite:18d40301-5c7f-41f8-990d-3661b87c4906}}. By applying a basic HOD model, we find our measured results are in fair agreement with the HOD parameters determined by {{cite:18d40301-5c7f-41f8-990d-3661b87c4906}}.
There are large differences in the correlation measurements of late-type galaxies at redshifts greater- and less-than 0.3. This is broadly consistent with cosmic downsizing {{cite:307ecb9e-139f-4040-b7a4-96f92da7af88}}. These differences predict a great amount of merger driven star formation at FORMULA , and are consistent with the observed evolution in the density/morphology relationship with redshift. Our results suggest that a detailed study of the density/morphology relationship as a function of redshift would find significant evolution at FORMULA .
If we require that bias be linear and set FORMULA , we find FORMULA , consistent with the lower limit on WMAP3 measurements constrained by inflationary models. If instead, we set FORMULA  equal to the FORMULA  independent value found by {{cite:23ee1f92-6ad6-4262-ba5e-bf6995012585}}, we find that FORMULA  is a great match to the WMAP3-SDSS combined measurement. Considering all of the results, the most likely conclusion is that FORMULA  is at least slightly negative and that FORMULA .
As per usual, the results of our study demand more investigation. To this end, we are currently working to extend the analyses presented herein in two complementary directions. First, as was discussed earlier, the value of FORMULA  can be constrained further by correcting the FORMULA  measurements for the assumed FORMULA  and measured FORMULA . Thus, by performing this analysis on the large, homogenous, photometric Luminous Red Galaxy sample from the SDSS and applying the results to our current analysis, we are thereby improving our measurements of higher-order bias terms and their dependence on galaxy-type, redshift, and luminosity. Second, we are also improving our theoretical interpretation of these results by performing a more rigorous halo occupation distribution model analysis of our higher-order correlation function measurements.
