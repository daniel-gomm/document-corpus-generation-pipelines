We present new results from a radial velocity study of
six bright OB stars with little or no prior measurements.
One of these, HD 45314, may be a long-period binary, but the
velocity variations of this Be star may be related to changes
in its circumstellar disk. Significant velocity variations
were also found for HD 60848 (possibly related to nonradial
pulsations) and HD 61827 (related to wind variations). The
other three targets, HD 46150, HD 54879, and HD 206183, are
constant velocity objects, but we note that HD 54879 has HFORMULA 
emission that may originate from a binary companion.
We illustrate the average red spectrum of each target.
Binaries: spectroscopic —

Introduction
Radial velocity measurements exist for many of the bright
OB stars because of their usefulness for binary mass determination
and cluster dynamics. However, in a survey of the multiplicity
of bright O-stars, {{cite:cd21519e-b762-4da0-b45b-173a8a7cbe81}} listed some 17 of 227 stars
without sufficient radial velocity data to determine whether or
not the stars were members of spectroscopic binaries.
We observed six of these targets with unknown spectroscopic
duplicity in two extended observing runs of high dispersion
and high S/N spectroscopy at the Kitt Peak National Observatory
(KPNO) coudé feed telescope in 2000. We have already
reported on discoveries made during these runs of new
single-lined spectroscopic binaries (HD 14633, HD 15137;
{{cite:ec318de6-2bd8-4bac-b552-2a700c5fa78c}}) and double-lined spectroscopic binaries
(HD 37366, HD 54662; {{cite:39d1d103-d5e3-47b3-8bf4-be5200ebf91c}}). Here we present our results
on the six of the stars with mainly “unknown” spectroscopic binary status
from the list of {{cite:cd21519e-b762-4da0-b45b-173a8a7cbe81}}. We describe the observations,
measurements, and analysis in §2 and then discuss the
individual targets in detail in §3. Our results are summarized
in Table 2 of §2.

Observations and Radial Velocities
Red spectra were collected with the KPNO 0.9 m coudé feed
telescope during two observing runs in 2000 October and 2000 December.
The spectra were made using the long collimator,
grating B (in second order with order sorting filter OG 550),
camera 5, and the F3KB CCD, a Ford Aerospace
FORMULA  device. The setup yielded a resolving
power of FORMULA ,
with a spectral coverage of FORMULA  Å. The
exposure times were less than 30 minutes yielding a FORMULA  per pixel.
We obtained between 22 and 62 spectra of each star.
The spectra were extracted and calibrated using standard routines
in IRAFIRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy
Observatory, which is operated by the Association of Universities
for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement
with the National Science Foundation., and then each continuum
rectified spectrum was transformed onto a uniform heliocentric
wavelength grid for analysis. We removed atmospheric lines by
creating a library of spectra from each run of the rapidly rotating
A-star FORMULA  Aql, removing the broad stellar features from these,
and then dividing each target spectrum by the modified atmospheric
spectrum that most closely matched the target spectrum in a selected
region dominated by atmospheric absorptions.
We measured radial velocities in two ways.
For targets with absorption lines, we formed
a cross-correlation function (ccf) between a given
spectrum and a single reference spectrum of the star
(usually the first observation).
These relative velocities were then transformed to an
absolute velocity scale by adding a mean
velocity measured by parabolic fits to the lower halves
of the absorption lines in the reference spectrum.
Two of the targets have spectra dominated by emission
lines and in these cases we measured bisector velocities
for the extreme line wings using the method of {{cite:25e8f06c-6462-4e2e-9fb0-82b9b3bd0721}}.
All these velocities are shown in Table 1Available
in full in the electronic version of the paper., which lists the star name,
heliocentric Julian date of mid-exposure, radial velocity, and
the line-to-line standard deviation FORMULA  (where
multiple lines were measured). In §3, we give a more
detailed description of the radial velocity analysis
performed on the individual stars.
tab1
We checked for evidence of temporal variations in the
velocity data by comparing the external scatter between
observations FORMULA  (equal to the standard deviation of the
individual velocities in Table 1) with an estimate of the
internal error FORMULA . The internal error is the average of
the line-to-line standard deviation FORMULA  for all but the
cases of HD 45314 and HD 60848 where only one spectral feature was
measured. For these two cases, we estimated FORMULA  by the
average of FORMULA  for observations closely
spaced in time. We then computed the FORMULA -statistic
to determine the probability that
the observed scatter is due to random noise {{cite:614fd101-20fc-4358-824b-41833043fde2}}.
We assume that the variations are significant if this
probability is below FORMULA  {{cite:614fd101-20fc-4358-824b-41833043fde2}}. The results
are summarized in Table 2 that lists the star name,
number of observations, the mean velocity, FORMULA , FORMULA ,
the derived probability, and a short description of the
probable source of the variations if present.
Details for each target follow in the next section.

Notes on Individual Stars
HD 45314
The star HD 45314 (O9 pe, {{cite:02af5429-0f93-47b9-9b58-b1bdc3d51571}}; B0 IVe, {{cite:7b41ef0d-5d63-4ab6-9932-ca51ab882f12}}) has
a speckle interferometric companion at a separation of 50 mas
(corresponding to a period of FORMULA  y; {{cite:cd21519e-b762-4da0-b45b-173a8a7cbe81}}).
The average red spectrum illustrated in Figure 1 shows that HFORMULA  and
He1FORMULA  are double-peaked emission lines.
This suggests that the emission forms in a disk and that the
line wings form in the gas closest to the star. Thus, we can
use measurements of the HFORMULA  wings as a proxy for the
motion of the underlying star. We measured radial velocities
using the wing bisector method of {{cite:25e8f06c-6462-4e2e-9fb0-82b9b3bd0721}}.
fig1
Our results indicate that there was a significant change in velocity
from FORMULA  km sFORMULA  to FORMULA  km sFORMULA 
between the runs. This may indicate that the Be star is a
spectroscopic binary with a period of months. However, the
emission profiles changed in shape between the runs (see Fig. 2
for the HFORMULA  averages from each run), so it is also
possible that the changes in bisector velocity result from
physical changes in the gas distribution in the disk rather
than orbital motion. We recommend a program of blue
spectroscopy of this star to distinguish between the binary
and disk variation explanations.
fig2

HD 46150
The spectroscopic binary status of HD 46150 (O5 V((f)); {{cite:7999d312-75f9-4c8a-961d-d5f6586004ec}})
remains inconclusive even though it has a history of radial velocity
measurements spanning eight decades {{cite:5d816b99-0194-443b-9210-8d3cbc0912ce}}, {{cite:c5196b0e-93d8-4975-b250-80062896d076}}, {{cite:257cd4eb-202e-4222-b8cc-dd35f7c0c8e7}}, {{cite:b46c1cd7-234a-45ad-a7bf-948be38699fe}}, {{cite:e57c5a38-1490-4945-a1c1-1d049587d238}}, {{cite:c70453b2-a3d0-4ff9-a375-9ae26a9bbb0a}}, {{cite:7999d312-75f9-4c8a-961d-d5f6586004ec}}, {{cite:f98f4061-2ccf-4562-ac11-804a6f28ed39}}, {{cite:01187c30-5be8-4184-a580-1b8e22d1d62b}}.
The measured radial velocities fall in the range of FORMULA  km sFORMULA .
{{cite:01187c30-5be8-4184-a580-1b8e22d1d62b}} suggest that this range is significantly
larger than expected for diverse measurements of a single star.
The most extensive analysis of this star
by {{cite:b46c1cd7-234a-45ad-a7bf-948be38699fe}} covered four observing
seasons, with a mean FORMULA  km sFORMULA  and a range of 26 km sFORMULA .
They conclude that the scatter results from
atmospheric rather than orbital variations (see also {{cite:7999d312-75f9-4c8a-961d-d5f6586004ec}}).
The mean red spectrum in Figure 3 shows a strong He2
spectrum associated with a very early-type star. We measured
ccf velocities of the HFORMULA , He1
FORMULA , and He2
FORMULA  features.
The error in the mean velocity from closely spaced pairs
is FORMULA  km sFORMULA  while the standard deviation
among the mean velocities is FORMULA  km sFORMULA .
A standard FORMULA -test {{cite:614fd101-20fc-4358-824b-41833043fde2}} indicates that a temporal
variation this large is expected by random variations with a
probability of FORMULA , i.e., the observed variation is probably
significant. However, most of the variance comes
from the first run where there appear to be relatively
large night-to-night variations that are absent in the
second run. This may indicate that the observational
errors were larger in the first run compared to our estimate of
FORMULA  from the scatter in measurements from the second run
(also consistent with the larger line-to-line scatter in
FORMULA  for the first run). Thus, the velocity variations are
probably not significant and are consistent with
constant radial velocity over the interval of our observations.
fig3

HD 54879
The target HD 54879 (B3 V, {{cite:4ae4d818-d77d-42e7-b40c-cb18025894d0}};
O9.5 V, {{cite:0db1bdd2-ef65-476c-8600-d9b8f11f7777}}; B0 V, {{cite:06e99652-bde7-4cc6-8e05-5456f5dcd9fc}})
has only a few spectroscopic measurements over
the past century. The mean spectrum shown in Figure 4
indicates that it has HFORMULA  emission and is thus a Be star,
which has historically never been observed in emission
until now. We made ccf velocity measurements using the lines
He1 FORMULA ,
C2 FORMULA , and
Si4 FORMULA .
fig4
Our FORMULA  measurements show no evidence of Doppler
shifts in the absorption lines over both short and long timescales.
The external error FORMULA  km sFORMULA  is somewhat larger than the internal error
FORMULA  km sFORMULA . The FORMULA -test indicates that a scatter between
observations of this size is expected with a probability of FORMULA ,
so this star is radial velocity constant over the duration of the runs.
The only other radial velocity measurement on record from
{{cite:4ae4d818-d77d-42e7-b40c-cb18025894d0}}, FORMULA  km sFORMULA , is smaller than our
mean of FORMULA  km sFORMULA . We caution that this
discrepancy may be caused by measuring different lines in the
blue part of the spectrum or by long term changes in the spectrum.
The mean spectrum has very narrow lines of He1,
C2, N2, O2, and Si4.
These apparently sharp absorption lines are unexpected in
Be stars that are normally rapid rotators with broad lines.
One possibility is that HD 54879 is a rare Be star that
is seen almost pole-on, so that the rotation is tangential
to the line of sight and the lines do not suffer rotational broadening.
Another possibility is that HD 54879 is a Be shell star in which
the narrow absorptions form in a circumstellar disk that is projected against
the star. The star might have a strong magnetic field that
controls the gas outflow and that has spun down the star.
Finally, the spectrum may be that of a long period binary
consisting of a bright, narrow-lined B-star and a fainter Be star
(although no companion was found in the speckle survey by
{{cite:cd21519e-b762-4da0-b45b-173a8a7cbe81}}). This explanation is supported by the fact that
the HFORMULA  emission does vary in strength and shape
on short and long timescales in our observations while the
absorption lines are constant.

HD 60848
The star HD 60848 is another Be-type object (O9.5 IVe, {{cite:7b41ef0d-5d63-4ab6-9932-ca51ab882f12}})
that may be a runaway star because of its position well out of the
Galactic plane {{cite:6e250853-4917-4df3-9dfe-b740652aee9f}}. It was recently observed with
moderate dispersion blue spectra by {{cite:1442c6b9-c2d8-408f-8e27-13154eec97e2}} who found no evidence
of velocity variability. We observed this star only during the
second run, but with a higher sampling rate (as frequent as
fifteen minute intervals during some nights). The mean red
spectrum (Fig. 5) shows that HFORMULA  and He1
FORMULA  all display double-peaked emission.
fig5
We measured relative radial velocities by determining ccf
offsets from the first spectrum for the He1 FORMULA  region,
and then these were placed on an absolute scale by finding the
bisector velocity of the profile in the first spectrum using the method
from {{cite:25e8f06c-6462-4e2e-9fb0-82b9b3bd0721}}. The external error of FORMULA  km sFORMULA  is larger
than the internal error of FORMULA  km sFORMULA ,
and the FORMULA -test indicates that this scatter has a probability
of FORMULA  for an origin in random variations. Furthermore,
there is clear evidence of systematic trends within some nights.
We used the CLEAN algorithm from {{cite:56249db3-34d7-411a-a59c-23baeb9a95b2}} to find evidence
of two periodic signals with periods of FORMULA  and FORMULA  hours
(both with peak power far above the FORMULA  false alarm probability defined
by {{cite:9130a8bc-4bd4-438c-bf15-ed935a04f984}}). These periods are much too small to be
related to binary motion. They may be due to changes in disk
density or illumination caused by nonradial pulsations in
the underlying star {{cite:bff4c3a3-e2a3-46dd-bbac-7ebee6c04b23}}.

HD 61827
The star HD 61827 (OFORMULA  Ib, {{cite:38480047-eabf-4c24-8f59-a16c403575f2}};
B3 Iab, {{cite:30527e1d-612b-4add-a888-78fd64819b3b}}; B3 Ia, {{cite:d1c42095-bc94-4662-8bb5-c0e5b6a9f108}})
is a luminous object in an association surrounding the cluster
NGC 2439 {{cite:d1c42095-bc94-4662-8bb5-c0e5b6a9f108}}. We found no evidence of a prior radial
velocity measurement in the literature. The star's red spectrum (Fig. 6)
shows HFORMULA  in emission as is often the case for B-supergiants.
The lack of He2 FORMULA  and the relative strength
of C2 FORMULA  support the later subtype
adopted by {{cite:30527e1d-612b-4add-a888-78fd64819b3b}} and {{cite:d1c42095-bc94-4662-8bb5-c0e5b6a9f108}}.
We used the C2 FORMULA  and
He1 FORMULA  absorption lines in the
ccf to determine radial velocities for this star.
The ratio of the external to the internal error indicates
that the star is a velocity variable.
fig6
Our spectra show dynamic HFORMULA  emission changes
with variable red and blue peaks appearing to vary
on a timescale of 5 – 10 d. We suspect that these
variations are related to structures in the stellar wind
that are modulated by rotation and temporal changes in
the outflow. These emission variations in HFORMULA  appear to affect
the velocities measured for the absorption lines of
C2 and He1 through
subtle effects of emission filling that are not
apparent to the eye. For example, during the
first run we observed the emergence of a strong redshifted
HFORMULA  peak during the time when the absorption velocities
attained their minimum value, and the appearance of a strongly
blueshifted HFORMULA  peak occurred at the time when the
absorption velocities reached a maximum. This correlation
indicates that the absorption lines we measured
(C2 and He1) are probably also
partially filled in by weak emission that shifts the line
center away from the location of the emission. Thus,
we suggest that the apparent velocity variations in HD 61827
are due to the effects of variations in the star's wind.

HD 206183
HD 206183 (O9.5 V, {{cite:046cc49d-d12f-4ba9-b254-b871144e24f7}}) resides in the Tr 37 cluster
in the Cep OB2 association. {{cite:cd21519e-b762-4da0-b45b-173a8a7cbe81}} list two visual companions,
but assign the star to the “unknown” status as a spectroscopic binary
since only one other velocity measurement exists {{cite:b8afdb91-7051-4ec0-8dac-e8934c6662ad}}.
The average red spectrum (Fig. 7) shows that the lines
are narrow (FORMULA  km sFORMULA ; {{cite:046cc49d-d12f-4ba9-b254-b871144e24f7}}).
We measured ccf radial velocities for HD 206183
using HFORMULA  and He1 FORMULA .
The mean velocities show no evidence for
velocity variability over the two runs.
