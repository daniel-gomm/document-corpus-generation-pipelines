These new states are not connected with the light neutrinos via the seesaw mechanism. A very interesting property of this extended model is the full coupling of the new neutral gauge boson FORMULA  to the right-handed neutrinos FORMULA , giving large total cross sections and suggesting a wide range of experimental search for the FORMULA  at the CERN-LHC pp collider and future ILC electron-positron collider.

Present day particle physics faces at least two problems with the masses of some of the fundamental particles.
The first one is that the high-energy loop corrections to the Standard Model Higgs mass suggest that new physics must be added to stabilize quantum corrections. This is the main motivation for supersymmetry and for the "little Higgs" scenario
{{cite:dec9bb14-9560-45da-a429-757a4e040395}}. The other problem is the experimental observation of very small neutrino masses {{cite:d88b8b2f-4c18-4f53-9392-9dea03241444}}. The pattern of small neutrino masses and high mixing angles still waits for a deeper theoretical understanding.
In this paper we point out a possible way to circumvent these problems: the inclusion of right-handed singlet neutrinos in the littlest Higgs model (LHM). There is a recent proposal in this direction {{cite:f6382e5b-ae78-4dcc-bafb-aee133c819ec}}, but using the enlarged little Higgs group FORMULA . Another proposal was put forward in {{cite:1dc7cdfd-fb1f-4b86-ab0c-a7c1bd063529}}. These authors considered the seesaw mechanism for generating neutrino masses. This mechanism implies new mass scales well above the little Higgs cutoff FORMULA  TeV and their conclusions were that this approach should be avoided. Since the seesaw mechanism has not been experimentally confirmed yet {{cite:ec3c1c0b-afc7-40db-802f-c41bece3dc62}}, it must be considered as one possible scenario, but not the only one. In fact, in the last few years a number of alternative models for neutrino masses have been proposed {{cite:5db5c6ae-fcb5-4cba-aa67-d64e44c4a3ef}}, {{cite:3ebb96fe-c28e-4cbf-8660-1026b5d41841}}, {{cite:d7b535af-50fd-4d69-bb4c-704af6872e51}}, {{cite:967721e4-871b-4558-bc18-ceeae9f65d1b}}, {{cite:60132f9b-0553-460a-8ee5-d0018bc11d51}}.
These models can differ in the fundamental mechanism for giving a small neutrino mass. They can include either more isosinglet right-handed neutrino states or unified theories with FORMULA  breaking or some singular mass matrix and new symmetries. But they all have one fundamental point in common: they do not need an ultra-high scale as in the seesaw mechanism. This property makes all of them suitable candidates for the fermionic sector of LHM, since they do not imply new scales above the little Higgs cutoff FORMULA  TeV, as already mentioned. The inclusion of new isosinglet right-handed neutrino states follows the general pattern of the other charged fermions of the Standard Model (SM) and, if they include Majorana mass terms, they offer a natural explanation for a possible lepton number violation.
As an example of such models we consider a scenario with three left-handed leptonic doublets and two new right-handed neutrino singlets. The mass Lagrangian for this model is given by
FORMULA 
where we have included Majorana mass terms for the right-handed singlets and the left-handed leptonic doublets are coupled to the standard model Higgs field FORMULA . If we consider all the couplings of the left-handed leptons to be of the order of the Fermi scale FORMULA  and allow a small mixing in the right-handed sector, then we have the following mass matrix,
FORMULA 
The diagonalization of this matrix leads to two states with zero mass, one with
FORMULA  and two heavy states with masses given by:
FORMULA 
Two small neutrino masses could be radiatively generated and a third one is a consequence of a small FORMULA . If we now make the additional hypothesis that the Majorana scale is FORMULA  TeV then the heavy mass states are FORMULA  GeV and FORMULA  GeV.
The important point in this model is that if the neutrino mass mechanism generation is not of the seesaw type, then we have no physical mass scales above the little Higgs cut-off at 10 GeV. The new possible states can be experimentally searched in future p p and FORMULA  FORMULA  colliders. Our example is not the only model possible and there are many other models with this property as given in references {{cite:5db5c6ae-fcb5-4cba-aa67-d64e44c4a3ef}}, {{cite:3ebb96fe-c28e-4cbf-8660-1026b5d41841}}, {{cite:d7b535af-50fd-4d69-bb4c-704af6872e51}}, {{cite:967721e4-871b-4558-bc18-ceeae9f65d1b}}, {{cite:60132f9b-0553-460a-8ee5-d0018bc11d51}}.
We turn now our attention to the inclusion of these new right-handed singlets in the littlest Higgs model.
The littlest Higgs gauge interactions come from the breaking of FORMULA  into its subgroup FORMULA .
The two stages of the FORMULA  breaking give us first the SM FORMULA  group at the scale FORMULA  of a few TeV and then FORMULA  at the Fermi scale FORMULA  GeV.
The Lagrangian of the gauged theory comes from the derivative replacement:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the coupling constants associated to the gauge fields FORMULA  and FORMULA , FORMULA  are the group generators.
The linear combinations of gauge fields that acquire mass in the TeV scale are
FORMULA 
whereas the combinations
FORMULA 
remain massless.
The mixing angles are given by
FORMULA 
The massless (at this stage) SM gauge bosons FORMULA  and FORMULA  have couplings
FORMULA 
The inclusion of right-handed neutrino states can be easily achieved, but with the following essential remark: their FORMULA  hypercharges FORMULA  and FORMULA  do not need both to be zero, but only their sum
FORMULA 
must be zero.
Then it follows that the new isosinglet gauge interactions in the neutral gauge boson sector are given by
FORMULA 
with the usual SM definition for the electroweak mixing angle,
FORMULA 
and FORMULA . Neglecting FORMULA  terms we have the LHM neutral gauge boson sector:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the SM neutral gauge bosons (photon and FORMULA ), FORMULA  and FORMULA  two heavy neutral gauge bosons. FORMULA  is new lightest boson in the LHM and it is expected to be detected at the LHC energies, if it exists.
The Lagrangian related to the neutral interactions for FORMULA  has the following combination:
FORMULA 
Clearly the condition FORMULA  not only decouples the FORMULA  state from the photon but also from the FORMULA . This is a consequence of the standard breaking of the LHM. This aspect eliminates the
strong constraint from the FORMULA  width that restricts the right-handed neutrino mass in other models {{cite:f8d37aed-9098-4784-bc2f-ad829400408c}}.
Before writing the final interactions for FORMULA , we must proceed to the neutrino mixing through the rotation matrix,
FORMULA 
The agreement of experimental data and the SM predictions implies FORMULA  FORMULA  {{cite:5db5c6ae-fcb5-4cba-aa67-d64e44c4a3ef}}. This small mixing can suppress heavy neutrino pair production in many models, as noticed some time ago {{cite:5db5c6ae-fcb5-4cba-aa67-d64e44c4a3ef}}. But this is not the case for the LHM with isosinglets FORMULA , from now on called LHMFORMULA . The present experimental bound on new heavy neutral lepton mass is FORMULA  GeV {{cite:d88b8b2f-4c18-4f53-9392-9dea03241444}}.
The final neutral interaction involving FORMULA  and considering neutrino mixing is described by
FORMULA 
where we can see explicitly the full coupling in the vertex FORMULA .
This is not the complete Lagrangian. There are other terms coming from the FORMULA  doublet {{cite:5d98a8f6-48ee-436b-8a2a-2feef8bfb490}}, but the FORMULA  vertex is suppressed by FORMULA . In order to study the consequences of introducing a new right-handed neutrino singlet, we present in the following figures the estimates for pair production of heavy neutrinos in the LHM that comes only from the FORMULA  doublet model and the case with new right-handed singlets. Since we have lepton number violation in this model, we can rotate the Dirac spinors of the right-handed neutrino singlets in two Majorana spinors {{cite:0f95f7f5-153f-4c29-84e3-dc28610148cf}}, giving lepton number violation and the possibility of leptogenesis {{cite:6fcf9066-2f98-40b9-89de-d766a25f9c57}} in the LHM. The other lepton and quark couplings are the same in both models.
Now we turn our attention to the total cross sections for the production of a pair of heavy Majorana neutrinos in the reactions FORMULA  at the ILC and FORMULA  at the LHC.
We have compared the results from the traditional LHM, that we call LHMFORMULA  which has a heavy neutrino FORMULA , with the LHMFORMULA  which has a new heavy right-handed neutrino singlet FORMULA .
Both models have been implemented in CompHEP {{cite:2fe24c32-4c27-4c8d-9b7e-ae083f1a45c3}} and the total cross sections have been calculated using
CTEQ5L parton distribution functions {{cite:4e64f452-d486-49ff-808e-4c2d6330fbb0}}. The heavy Majorana neutrino can decay to FORMULA , FORMULA ,
FORMULA , where FORMULA , with branching ratios dependent on FORMULA  {{cite:2c506cdb-9e20-4f31-9d2f-7ee7fe7e9b4f}}.
The main final states originating from the production of a pair of Majorana neutrinos will be FORMULA , where FORMULA , like-sign dilepton events plus jets and leptons, with or without missing energy. In our calculations, we have considered FORMULA  {{cite:ab3ea851-1c45-4bc5-9a09-fc7b1a3308f2}}, FORMULA  in the range FORMULA , allowed by the electroweak precision data {{cite:a54b435e-ad7f-4fd9-b31c-cd35a11f9848}}, {{cite:b7463777-4087-4b1e-ae6c-529b3d091052}} and FORMULA  and FORMULA  as free parameters.
The contributions to the process FORMULA  come from FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  exchanges. The dominant diagram is given by the FORMULA  s-channel exchange.
The total cross section enhancement is a consequence of the FORMULA  factor in the coupling of the FORMULA  to FORMULA . Confirming this expectation the results for a future FORMULA  collider for energies FORMULA  GeV and FORMULA  TeV are shown in Figures 1 and 2 respectively for FORMULA  GeV and two values of FORMULA  and FORMULA . The total cross section difference between the two models is FORMULA  in the resonant region. For FORMULA  TeV, these values are still of order FORMULA  in central region too.
The total cross section enhancement due to the new heavy right-handed neutrino singlet would make this new neutrino observable up to FORMULA , should this new neutral gauge boson really exist. The total cross sections for other values of FORMULA  are between the two extremes shown, except for FORMULA , where FORMULA  decouples from FORMULA , as can be seen from Eq. 13. It should be noted that this is not the same angle where FORMULA  decouples from the SM fermions {{cite:5d98a8f6-48ee-436b-8a2a-2feef8bfb490}}. This point will be explored in more detail in a work in progress. Considering an annual luminosity FORMULA  fbFORMULA , ILC can produce FORMULA  and FORMULA  events for FORMULA  GeV and FORMULA  TeV respectively, in the resonant region without cuts.
The results for the proton-proton collisions at FORMULA  TeV, that will take place at the LHC, are shown in Figures 3 and 4 for two FORMULA  values. We obtained the total cross sections for neutrino pair production in the process FORMULA  as a function of the neutrino mass, taking a cut FORMULA  GeV on the invariant mass of final fermions, and for FORMULA  in the range FORMULA . Considering an annual luminosity of FORMULA  fbFORMULA  and FORMULA  GeV, LHC can produce 500 events for FORMULA  GeV and 5 events for FORMULA  GeV.
For an FORMULA  collider there is a large number of events at the resonance. At the LHC collider there is a wide range of neutrino mass that can be explored up to FORMULA .

We have shown that the introduction of right-handed neutrino singlets FORMULA  in the content of the LHM presents a very particular behavior, leading to sizeable total cross sections in FORMULA  and p p collisions at the next generation of colliders and widening the FORMULA  mass search up to FORMULA . New charged heavy leptons in Little Higgs models are also possible {{cite:3373bbca-b874-4fbd-9de5-9d0a61dffd1f}}. The associated production of
a new neutrino state FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA  exchange can be a very clear experimental test for the littlest Higgs model. An eventual lepton number violation would point to the Majorana nature of FORMULA  and this will be discussed in a separate publication.
