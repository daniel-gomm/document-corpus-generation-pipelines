The final state interactions (FSI) model in which soft rescattering of low mass
intermediate states dominates is
suggested. It explains why the strong interaction phases
are large in the
FORMULA  channel and are considerably smaller in the
FORMULA  one. Direct CP asymmetries of FORMULA 
decays which are determined by FSI
phases are considered as well.
Introduction
There are three reasons to study FSI in FORMULA  decays: to
predict (or explain) the pattern of branching ratios, to
study strong interactions, and to forsee in what decays
direct CPV will be large. In view of this necessity
a model for FSI in FORMULA  decays to two light mesons is suggested
and explored in the present paper.
The probabilities of three FORMULA  and three
FORMULA  decays are measured now with good accuracy. The
FORMULA -averaged branching ratios of these decays are presented in
Table 1 {{cite:91a2e89e-174c-4ce8-b1d8-cd3bc426c8ff}}. Let us look at the ratio of the charge averaged
FORMULA  decay probabilities to the charged and neutral mesons:
FORMULA 
Table 1
 TABLE
FORMULA -averaged branching ratios of FORMULA  and
FORMULA  decays.
The large difference of FORMULA  and FORMULA  is due to the
difference of FSI phases in FORMULA  and FORMULA 
decays (see below). In Section 2 we will determine the
differences of FSI
phases of tree amplitudes which describe FORMULA  and
FORMULA  decays into the states with isospins zero and two from
the data presented in Table 1. As a next step we will suggest a
mechanism which produces such phases. Once this
mechanism is defined it becomes possible to calculate FSI
phases of decay amplitudes into states with a definite isospin
(not only their differences).
A central question is: what intermediate states
produce FSI phases in FORMULA -meson decays into two light mesons.
In the weak decay FORMULA  in the rest frame of a heavy quark (which is FORMULA -meson
rest frame as well) three fast light quarks are produced.
Their energies are of the order of FORMULA  and momenta are
more or less isotropically oriented. The energy of the fourth
(spectator) quark is
of the order of FORMULA . This four quark state transforms
mainly
into multi pi-meson final state with the average pion multiplicity about
9 (this number follows from the experimentally known charged
particles multiplicity in FORMULA  annihilation at FORMULA GeV
multiplied by FORMULA  in order to take neutral pions and third quark jet
into account). The total branching ratio of such decays is about
FORMULA . However such meson state does
not transform into the state composed from two light mesons moving into
opposite directions with momenta FORMULA . What meson state does
transform into two light mesons can be understood from the inverse
reaction of two light meson scattering at the center of mass
energy equal to the mass
of FORMULA -meson. The produced hadronic state consists of two jets of
particles moving in opposite directions. Each jet should originate
from a quark-antiquark pair produced in the weak decay of FORMULA -quark.
The square of invariant
mass of a jet which contains spectator quark does not exceed FORMULA  and is much smaller than FORMULA . The energy of this jet
is determined by that of a companion quark and is about FORMULA . That
is why the square of invariant mass of the second jet also does not exceed
FORMULA . So for FORMULA -decays the mass of a hadron cluster
which transforms into
light meson in the final state should not exceed
1.5 GeV. Following these
arguments in the calculation of the imaginary
parts of the decay amplitudes we will take into account only two
(relatively light) particle intermediate states for which
branching ratios of FORMULA -meson are maximal.
In Section 3 we will calculate FSI phases of tree amplitudes
describing FORMULA  decays taking into account FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and FORMULA  intermediate states which by FORMULA -channel
exchanges are converted into FORMULA .
We will find that large probability of FORMULA  decay
explains about half of FSI phases of FORMULA  decays.
Relatively small probability of FORMULA  decay prevents
generation of noticeable FSI phase of FORMULA  amplitudes
through FORMULA  chain.
We will demonstrate that the strong interaction phase of the penguin amplitude is opposite to the result of quark loop calculation, which is very important for the value of a
direct CPV asymmetry FORMULA 
discussed in Section 4.
Predictions for CPV asymmetries FORMULA  and FORMULA  will be presented
in Section 4
as well and the value of the unitarity triangle angle FORMULA  will
be extracted from the experimental data on CPV asymmetry FORMULA .
Subject of rare FORMULA  decays is an object of intensive study nowadays
and an interested reader can find extensive list of references
in a recent paper {{cite:649a45a2-0eb2-43ef-ad5c-57cdba573a30}}.

Phenomenology; FORMULA  and
 FORMULA
Let us present FORMULA  decay amplitudes in the so-called
“FORMULA -convention”, in which the penguin amplitude with the
intermediate FORMULA -quark multiplied by FORMULA  is subtracted from the decay amplitudes
{{cite:3428e022-0d13-41b5-8081-219aab028a6c}}:
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  are the elements of CKM matrix, FORMULA  and FORMULA 
are the unitarity triangle angles and we factor out the product FORMULA  which appears when the decay amplitudes are calculated
in the factorization approximation. FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the absolute
values of the decay amplitudes into the states with FORMULA  and 0,
generated by operators FORMULA  and FORMULA  (tree amplitudes), while
FORMULA  is the absolute value of QCD penguin amplitude (generated by
operators FORMULA  of effective nonleptonic Hamiltonian which
describes FORMULA  quark decays into the states without charm and strange
quarks). FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA 
are FSI phases of these three amplitudes, and it is very important
for what follows
that all of them are different. It is easy to understand why
FORMULA  is different from FORMULA : strong
interaction depends on the isospin and is different for FORMULA  and
FORMULA . For example, there are definitely quark-antiquark
resonances with FORMULA , while exotic resonances with FORMULA  should
be made from at least four quarks and their existence is
questionable. The reason why FORMULA  differs from
FORMULA  is more subtle. Let us consider the intermediate
state made from two charged FORMULA -mesons which contributes to FSI
phases: FORMULA . FORMULA 
intermediate state contribution to FSI phases can be large since FORMULA  is big. Both tree and penguin induced
amplitudes get FSI phases through this chain. Its contribution to
FORMULA  is proportional to FORMULA ,
while that to FORMULA  is proportional to FORMULA .
How can we determine the penguin contributions to the probabilities of
FORMULA  and FORMULA -decays? The most
straightforward way suggested in literature is to extract them
from the probabilities of FORMULA  and FORMULA  decays to which tree amplitudes almost do not contribute
{{cite:c1f44f8c-2191-4008-b2d4-c61a0be91905}}, {{cite:df8926d3-39ed-4ecb-83c4-d754364bd762}}Contribution of tree amplitudes to these
decays comes from the rescattering FORMULA , FORMULA , and taking into account CKM suppression of
the
tree amplitudes of FORMULA  decays relative to the penguin
amplitudes we can cautiously estimate
tree contribution as not more than 10% of penguin one
.:
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  MeV and FORMULA  MeV are the vector meson
decay constants, FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA 
are the CKM matrix parameters in Wolfenstein parametrization {{cite:335f0250-9a3e-476e-a504-a7b34011e0ec}},
FORMULA  and the central values of FORMULA  and FORMULA  {{cite:91a2e89e-174c-4ce8-b1d8-cd3bc426c8ff}} were used. The
accuracy of equations (REF ) and (REF ) depends on the accuracy
of FORMULA  interchange symmetry
(FORMULA -spin symmetry) of FORMULA 
transition amplitudes described by QCD penguin, however when the ratio
of
(REF ) to (REF ) is calculated uncertainty factors partially
cancel out and we obtain rather stable result:
instead of being enchanced as in the case of the tree amplitude
intermediate vector mesons contribution into penguin FORMULA  amplitude is suppressed,
FORMULA . Taking into account that fraction of
longitudinally polarized vector mesons produced in FORMULA 
decays is about 50% we get additional suppression of FORMULA  by
factor FORMULA .
Finally, phase FORMULA  comes from the imaginary part of
the penguin loop with FORMULA -quark propagating in it {{cite:7bc5a364-80cf-498a-8421-9be88e0bc844}}.
In order to calculate FORMULA  let us consider
corresponding quark diagram. The charm penguin contribution is given
by the
following expression:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the sum of momenta of two quarks to which gluon radiated
from penguin
decays: FORMULA . One of these quarks forms FORMULA -meson with the
spectator quark, so neglecting spectator quark momentum in the
rest frame of FORMULA -meson we have FORMULA . The second quark forms another FORMULA -meson with
FORMULA -quark radiated from penguin: FORMULA  where FORMULA  is the fraction of FORMULA 
momentum carried by FORMULA -quark. Substituting FORMULA  into
(REF ) and integrating it with the asymptotic quark distribution function
in FORMULA -meson FORMULA  we obtain the value of
FORMULA  which depends on the ratio FORMULA . In
particular, for FORMULA  GeV and FORMULA  GeV
(which correspond to the masses of physical states) we obtain
FORMULA , a small positive value. A
nonperturbative calculation of FORMULA 
described in Section 3 demonstrates that the sign of
FORMULA  can be negative.
Our next task is to determine the difference of FSI phases
FORMULA  (the large value of it is responsible
for a relatively small value of FORMULA ). If we neglect the penguin
contribution, then from (REF ) - (REF ) we get the following
expression:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA 's are the FORMULA -averaged branching ratios, while
FORMULA . Substituting the
central values from Table 1 we get FORMULA .
Penguin contributions to FORMULA  do not interfere with tree ones
because FORMULA  is almost equal to FORMULA .
Taking FORMULA  terms into account with the help of (REF )
(subtracting 0.59 and 0.30 from the first and the second lines of
Table 1 numbers
describing FORMULA  data correspondingly)
we get:
FORMULA 
The accuracy of this 11o decrease of the absolute value of the
phases
difference is determined by the accuracy of (REF ) and is not
high. In
recent paper {{cite:649a45a2-0eb2-43ef-ad5c-57cdba573a30}} the global fit of FORMULA  and FORMULA 
decay data was made. The tree amplitudes of FORMULA  decays were
designated in {{cite:649a45a2-0eb2-43ef-ad5c-57cdba573a30}} by FORMULA  for FORMULA  and by
FORMULA  for FORMULA . According to {{cite:649a45a2-0eb2-43ef-ad5c-57cdba573a30}} the difference of FSI
phases between FORMULA  and FORMULA  equals FORMULA ,
FORMULA , FORMULA  in the units of
FORMULA  eV. The phase shift between the isospin amplitudes is
determined by
these quantities:
FORMULA 
and substituting the numbers we obtain:
FORMULA 
the result very close to (REF ). However, the same
FORMULA  interchange symmetry was used in {{cite:649a45a2-0eb2-43ef-ad5c-57cdba573a30}}
when relating FORMULA  and FORMULA  decays.
Fit {{cite:649a45a2-0eb2-43ef-ad5c-57cdba573a30}} was made in the same “FORMULA -convention” which we use
(see the
statement at the end of page 3 of the paper {{cite:649a45a2-0eb2-43ef-ad5c-57cdba573a30}}:
“for simplicity, we will assume
... FORMULA ”), therefore the obtained results can be
directly compared with ours.
Now let us consider FORMULA  decays. According to BABAR and
BELLE results FORMULA  mesons produced in FORMULA  decays are almost
entirely longitudinally polarized ( FORMULA{{cite:f391a9a0-63c7-4713-ae3d-8087103be4f2}}, FORMULA  {{cite:34a99ae1-aa0a-4c56-a63f-86570c9fbe46}},
FORMULA  {{cite:ea62130e-ed62-4a00-ba35-bcde0e8b59bd}}). For FORMULA  decays into
the longitudinally polarized FORMULA -mesons we can write formulas
analogous to (REF ) - (REF ) and we can find FSI phases
difference with the help of analog of (REF ). Substituting the central values of
branching ratios of FORMULA  decays from Table 1 we obtain:
FORMULA . In order to subtract the
penguin contribution with the help of (REF ) we should take
into account that in FORMULA  decays the fraction
of the
longitudinally polarized vector mesons equals approximately 50%
{{cite:dcd87dc3-49c8-4f41-bc63-59df0813a277}}, so we should subtract FORMULA  in case of
decay to FORMULA  and FORMULA  for decay into
FORMULA . In this way we obtain:
FORMULA 
and the factor 2 difference between (REF ) and (REF ) or
(REF ) is responsible for the different patterns of
FORMULA  and FORMULA  decay probabilities. Let us
emphasize
that while FORMULA  being only
one standard deviation from zero
can be very small this is not so for
FORMULA .

Calculation of the FSI phases of FORMULA 
and FORMULA  decay amplitudes
Among three amplitudes of FORMULA  decays (REF )–(REF )
only two are independent. We will calculate FSI phases of
FORMULA  and FORMULA  amplitudes and extract from them
FSI phases of amplitudes with a definite isospin.
Our task is to take into account the intermediate state
contributions into FSI phases.
As it was argued in
Introduction we should consider only two particle intermediate
states with positive FORMULA -parity to which FORMULA -mesons have relatively
large decay probabilities. Alongside with FORMULA  and FORMULA 
there is only
one such state: FORMULA . So we will consider FORMULA 
intermediate state which transforms into FORMULA  by FORMULA 
exchange in FORMULA -channel,
FORMULA  intermediate state which transforms into
FORMULA  by FORMULA  exchange in FORMULA -channel and will take into account
the elastic channel FORMULA  as well.
This approach is analogous to the FSI consideration performed
in paper {{cite:e900ad96-ed05-49a7-8928-a5f4ded79660}}. However in {{cite:e900ad96-ed05-49a7-8928-a5f4ded79660}} FORMULA 
scattering amplitudes were considered to be due to
elementary particle exchanges in FORMULA -channel. For vector particles
exchanges FORMULA -channel partial wave amplitudes behave as
FORMULA  and thus do not decrease with energy (decaying
meson mass). However it is well known that the correct
behavior is given by Regge theory: FORMULA .
For FORMULA -exchange FORMULA  and the
amplitude decrease with energy as FORMULA .
This effect
is very spectacular for FORMULA  chain with FORMULA 
exchange in FORMULA -channel: FORMULA 
and reggeized FORMULA  meson exchange is damped
as FORMULA  in comparison with elementary FORMULA 
exchange (see for example {{cite:37f40852-1312-435e-bc9f-75ee32831064}}). For FORMULA -exchange, which
gives a dominant contribution to FORMULA  transition
(see below), in the small FORMULA  region the
pion is close to mass shell and its reggeization is not important.
We will use Feynman diagram approach to calculate FSI phases from
the triangle diagram with the low mass intermediate states FORMULA  and
FORMULA  (see Figure 1). Integrating over loop momenta FORMULA 
we assume that integrals over masses of intermediate states FORMULA  and FORMULA 
decrease
rapidly with increase of these masses.
Then choosing FORMULA  axis in the direction of
momenta of
the produced meson FORMULA  we can transform the integral over
FORMULA  and FORMULA  into the integral over the invariant masses of clusters
of intermediate particles FORMULA  and  FORMULA
FORMULA 
and deform integration contours in such a way that only low mass
intermediate states contributions are taken into account while the
contribution of heavy states
being small is neglected.
In this way we get:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  are the decay matrix elements without FSI
interactions and FORMULA  is the FORMULA  partial wave
amplitude of the process FORMULA 
which originates from the integral over FORMULA .
FIGURE 
For real FORMULA  (REF ) coincides with the application of the unitarity
condition for the calculation of the imaginary part of FORMULA  while for
the imaginary FORMULA  the corrections to the real part of FORMULA  are generated.
Let us calculate the imaginary parts of FORMULA  decay amplitudes
which originate from FORMULA  chain with the help
of unitarity condition in this section the phases which
originate from CKM matrix elements are omitted.:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the angle between FORMULA  and FORMULA  momenta. For
small values of FORMULA  or FORMULA  FORMULA -exchange in FORMULA -channel
dominates and the calculation of Feynman diagram for
FORMULA  amplitude with the elementary virtual FORMULA -meson
exchange can be trusted, as it was noted above. It was already stressed that FORMULA -mesons
produced in FORMULA -decays are almost entirely longitudinally
polarized. That is why we will take into account only longitudinal
polarization for the intermediate FORMULA -mesons and amplitudes of
FORMULA -decays into FORMULA  and FORMULA  are simply related
relative negative sign of the amplitudes follows from the
expressions for transition formfactors in the factorization approximation,
see for example {{cite:fd27068f-686a-4cde-af0a-725c9669086b}}.:
FORMULA 
For the amplitude of FORMULA  transition
we have:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  are FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA 
momenta. From the width of FORMULA -meson we get
FORMULA . For the longitudinally polarized
FORMULA -mesons in their center of mass system we have:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA . Changing the integration variable in
(REF ) to FORMULA  with the help of FORMULA  and
introducing formfactor FORMULA  with the parameter
FORMULA  we obtain:
FORMULA 
For FORMULA  the contributions of the first two terms in
square brackets cancel, while the third term gives:
FORMULA 
and from (REF ) we get:
FORMULA 
Let us note that in the limit FORMULA 
the ratio FORMULA  grows as FORMULA ,
that is why FSI phase
FORMULA  (and FORMULA )
diminishes as FORMULA .
The analogous consideration of FORMULA  intermediate state leads
to the positive FSI phase of FORMULA  amplitude which is
enhanced relatively to FORMULA  according to
(REF ):
FORMULA 
and for FSI phase of the amplitude with isospin zero in the linear
approximation we get:
FORMULA 
We are able to extract the ratio FORMULA  from that of FORMULA -averaged
FORMULA , FORMULA 
and FORMULA , subtracting penguin
contribution as we did deriving (REF ):
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
and, finally:
FORMULA 
In this way we see that FORMULA  chain generates
half of the experimentally observed FSI phase difference of
FORMULA  tree amplitudes.
It is remarkable that FSI phases generated by
FORMULA  chain are damped by FORMULA  ratios and are a few degrees:
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
Next we will take into account FORMULA  intermediate state.
From Regge analysis of
FORMULA  elastic scattering we know that good description
of the experimental data is achieved when the exchanges of pomeron,
FORMULA  and FORMULA 
trajectories in FORMULA -channel are taken into account {{cite:88d6e63c-05f6-45ed-9862-dab77e013d79}}.
Pomeron
exchange dominates in elastic FORMULA  scattering at high
energies. For FORMULA  the corresponding amplitude FORMULA  is
purely imaginary and the phases of matrix elements
do not change {{cite:3428e022-0d13-41b5-8081-219aab028a6c}}.
However taking into account that pomeron is "supercritical",
FORMULA , we obtain the phase of the amplitude
generated by pomeron exchange
The amplitude of FORMULA 
process due to supercritical pomeron exchange is FORMULA , where in the last expression FORMULA  was substituted and FORMULA  was used (FORMULA ).
which cancels the
phases generated by FORMULA  and FORMULA  exchanges for FORMULA . For FORMULA 
the sum of FORMULA  and FORMULA  exchanges produces the purely imaginary amplitude
FORMULA  and the phase of the amplitude FORMULA  is due to
pomeron "supercriticallity":
FORMULA 
In paper {{cite:3428e022-0d13-41b5-8081-219aab028a6c}} the pomeron exchange amplitude was considered as purely
imaginary. As a result though important for branching ratios phase
difference FORMULA  was the same
(pomeron contribution being universal cancels in the difference of phases)
it came mainly from FORMULA  negative value.
In this way result for the absolute value of direct CP-asymmetry
FORMULA  was underestimated, see below.
Finally FORMULA  intermediate state should be accounted for.
Large branching ratio of FORMULA -decay
( FORMULA ) is
partially compensated by small FORMULA  coupling constant
(it is FORMULA  of FORMULA  one).
As a result the contributions of FORMULA  intermediate state (which
transforms into FORMULA  by FORMULA -trajectory exchange in FORMULA -channel)
to FSI phases equal approximately that part of FORMULA  intermediate
state contributions which is due to FORMULA -trajectory exchange.
Assuming that the sign of the FORMULA  intermediate state contribution into
phases is the same as that of elastic channel we obtain:
FORMULA 
Summing the imaginary parts of the amplitudes which follow from
(REF ), (REF ), (REF ) and (REF )
we finally obtain:
FORMULA 
and the accuracy of these numbers is not high, at the level of FORMULA .
The analogous consideration of the real parts of the loop corrections
to FORMULA  decay amplitudes
leads to the diminishing of the (real) tree amplitudes by FORMULA ,
and
we can explain the
experimentally observed value FORMULA  in our model while for FORMULA  final
state the analogous difference is about three times smaller, FORMULA .
Let us estimate the phase of the penguin amplitude FORMULA 
considering charmed mesons intermediate states: FORMULA 
These amplitudes are considered as penguin
due to the proper combination of CKM matrix
elements.. In Regge model
all these amplitudes are described at high energies by exchanges of
FORMULA -trajectories. An intercept of these exchange-degenerate
trajectories can be obtained using the method of {{cite:5c53c8d8-334c-4841-8237-e6e7c7730ddd}} or from masses of FORMULA –FORMULA  and FORMULA –FORMULA  resonances,
assuming linearity of these Regge-trajectories. Both methodes give
FORMULA  and the slope FORMULA .
The amplitude of FORMULA  reaction in the Regge model
proposed in papers {{cite:3e773032-a7f2-4082-a070-ff178e18ee5c}}, {{cite:a6c666f8-e1e8-473e-815e-be03437c341f}} can be written in the following form:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the gamma function.
The FORMULA -dependence of Regge-residues is chosen in accord with the dual
models and is tested for light (u,d,s) quarks {{cite:3e773032-a7f2-4082-a070-ff178e18ee5c}}. According to
{{cite:a6c666f8-e1e8-473e-815e-be03437c341f}} FORMULA .
Note that the sign of the amplitude is fixed by the unitarity in the
FORMULA -channel (close to the FORMULA -resonance). The constant FORMULA  is
determined by the width of the FORMULA  decay: FORMULA .
Using (REF ), analog of (REF ), (REF ) and the branching
ratio FORMULA  {{cite:3535b8db-9c91-45b3-add8-1b59b4dfa1cc}} we obtain
the imaginary part of FORMULA  and comparing it with the contribution of
FORMULA  in FORMULA  decay probability (REF ) we get
 FORMULAIn integration over
FORMULA  the region FORMULA  dominates.
In this region representation (REF ) is valid.. A smallness of the phase is due to the low
intercept of FORMULA -trajectory. The sign of FORMULA  is negative - opposite
to the positive sign which was obtained in perturbation theory (REF ).
Since FORMULA -decay channel constitutes only FORMULA  of all two-body
charm-anticharm decays of FORMULA -meson {{cite:3535b8db-9c91-45b3-add8-1b59b4dfa1cc}} taking these channels into
account we can easily get
FORMULA 
which may be very important for the interpretation of the experimental data
on direct CP asymmetry FORMULA  discussed in the next section.

CP asymmetries of FORMULA  decays
The CP asymmetries are given by :
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is FORMULA  or FORMULA .
From (REF ) for direct CP asymmetry in FORMULA 
decays we readily obtain:
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
In order to make a numerical estimate we should know the ratios
FORMULA  and FORMULA . The first one is given by (REF ) while the
second one can be extracted from the ratio FORMULA  assuming FORMULA  invariance of
the strong interactions:
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
The numerical values of FORMULA  and FORMULA  are given with good accuracy
by factorization calculation, while FORMULA  appears to be 2.5 times
larger than factorization result {{cite:3428e022-0d13-41b5-8081-219aab028a6c}}. In view of this the validity
of factor FORMULA  in (REF ) which originates from
factorization calculation of the penguin amplitude is questinable.
If factorization of the penguin amplitudes is not assumed then the
ratio FORMULA  in (REF ) should be replaced by
unity. In this way we get FORMULA  larger value of FORMULA  in
(REF ) and we will take this value of uncertainty as an estimate
of the theoretical accuracy of the determination of FORMULA :
FORMULA 
Taking into account that unitarity
triangle angle FORMULA  and angles
FORMULA  and FORMULA  are of the order of few
degrees from (REF ) we obtain:
FORMULA 
In order to determine the lower bound on the value of FORMULA  let us suppose that
FORMULA  (we keep the difference
FORMULA , as it follows from the data on
FORMULA  decay probabilities (REF )), and neglect
small values of FORMULA  and FORMULA :
FORMULA 
Concerning experimental number it could well happen that finally it
will be considerably below our bound. In this case the result
of nonperturbative calculation of penguin phase will be
confirmed. Substituting in (REF ) FORMULA  and FORMULA  from (REF ) we obtain the following central
value:
FORMULA 
It is instructive to compare the obtained numbers with the value of FORMULA 
which follows from the asymmetry FORMULA  if FORMULA 
symmetry is supposed {{cite:58a19661-2ce4-432e-9512-51ad0ebcb3e2}}:
FORMULA 
Let us note that one factor FORMULA  in the last equation
appears from the matrix element of the tree operator, the second one -
from the matrix element of the penguin operator. If
because of nonfactorization of penguin amplitudes
we will omit the factor which appears from the penguin {{cite:df8926d3-39ed-4ecb-83c4-d754364bd762}},
then the
numbers in the right-hand sides of (REF , REF ) and (REF ) will become
FORMULA  smaller.
The experimental results obtained by Belle {{cite:8e530dc1-3a4e-4aeb-9504-166e94dec90e}} and BABAR {{cite:50d705e7-03e6-40f0-b6c2-31c02b7d48b1}}
are contradictory
FORMULA 
Belle number being far below (REF ) and (REF ).
For direct CP asymmetry in FORMULA  decay
from (REF ) we readily obtain:
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
considerably smaller than FORMULA . This unusually large direct CPV
(measured by FORMULA ) is intriguing task for future measurements
since the present experimental error is too big:
FORMULA 
Belle and BABAR agree now on the value of another CPV asymmetry measured in FORMULA 
decays: FORMULA  {{cite:8e530dc1-3a4e-4aeb-9504-166e94dec90e}}, {{cite:50d705e7-03e6-40f0-b6c2-31c02b7d48b1}}. From this measurement the value of
unitarity triangle angle FORMULA  can be extracted. Neglecting the penguin contribution we get:
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
Penguin shifts the value of FORMULA . The accurate formula
looks like:
FORMULA 
and since all the phase shifts are not big the values of cosines
in
(REF )
are rather stable relative to their variations. For
numerical estimates we take FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and neglect FORMULA  and FORMULA .
In this way we get:
FORMULA 
where the first error comes from uncertainty in FORMULA 
while the second one comes from that in the value of penguin
amplitude, (REF ).
Relatively large theoretical uncertainty in the value of
FORMULA  does not prevent to determine FORMULA  with good
precision.
The relative smallness of penguin contribution to FORMULA 
decay amplitudes allow us to determine FORMULA  with better
theoretical accuracy
from the experimental measurement of FORMULA  just as
it was done in {{cite:91682c32-646e-44fe-84fc-eca0dbb8fa08}}. With the help
of (REF ) we obtain:
FORMULA 
where the same FORMULA  uncertainty in extracting penguin amplitude is
supposed. Using the ratio FORMULA  determined in (REF )
from the (REF ) neglecting strong phases (which are much smaller than
in the case of FORMULA  decays) and taking into account the recent
experimental result
FORMULA  {{cite:91a2e89e-174c-4ce8-b1d8-cd3bc426c8ff}} we obtain:
FORMULA 
Let us point out that considerably larger theoretical error quoted in
{{cite:c1f44f8c-2191-4008-b2d4-c61a0be91905}} follows from the larger theoretical uncertainty in the value
of penguin
amplitude assumed in that paper.
Our results for FORMULA  should be compared with the numbers
which follow from the global fit
of unitarity triangle {{cite:335f0250-9a3e-476e-a504-a7b34011e0ec}}, {{cite:7d5328d3-4738-423b-b396-e75b10acacb1}}:
FORMULA 
We conclude this section with the prediction for the value
of CPV
asymmetry FORMULA :
FORMULA 
a large asymmetry with the sign opposite to that of FORMULA .

Conclusions
FSI appeared to be very important in FORMULA  decays.
The description of these interactions
presented in the paper allows to explain the experimentally observed difference of the
ratios of decay probabilities to the
neutral and charged modes in FORMULA  and FORMULA 
decays.
Rather large absolute value of direct CP asymmetry
FORMULA  (if confirmed experimentally) will be a manifestation of the negative sign of penguin FSI phase in accord with nonperturbative calculation
and opposite to perturbative result.
We are grateful to L.V.Akopyan for checking formulas,
Jose Ocariz for recommendation to include the result for angle
FORMULA  which follows from CP asymmetry FORMULA 
and M.B.Voloshin for useful discussion.
