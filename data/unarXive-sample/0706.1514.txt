In this article we review our work on the dynamics and decoherence of electron and hole
spins in single and double quantum dots. The first
part, on electron spins, focuses on decoherence induced via the
hyperfine interaction while the second part covers decoherence and
relaxation of heavy-hole spins due to spin-orbit interaction as
well as the manipulation of heavy-hole spin using electric dipole spin
resonance.

Introduction
The Loss-DiVincenzo proposal{{cite:2acbb64b-9708-48bb-a870-6eb650e313c1}} to use the spin of a
single electron confined in a quantum dot as a qubit for quantum
computation has triggered significant interest in the dynamics and
control of single spins in quantum dots. This has led to numerous
exciting experimental achievements, among them the realization of single
electrons in single dots {{cite:92313d7e-047b-4f2f-8ef8-2fbe9f96c0c5}}, {{cite:83723ace-3226-4d20-879b-7cf5cd6f4921}} as well
as double dots {{cite:269c9fef-3855-46bf-8002-c49906948e4b}}, {{cite:bc9275ca-bc99-4507-8623-bfbf35b20c32}}, {{cite:c85891a3-46ab-4ae2-b6ed-6bf7d7ad2f73}}, the
implementation of single-spin read
out{{cite:8ed42dac-4620-4e49-8c4f-df3184ad1915}}, {{cite:45620779-52ff-41c8-92fd-873b512ac13b}}, the demonstration of the
FORMULA  operation via pulsed exchange
interaction{{cite:5e2bcdf2-f181-4ced-b8cb-7ecb76b33c74}} and the measurement of single-spin ESR
{{cite:d880a50c-925f-49e5-a4a2-e78e55aee554}}. For a detailed account of the progress in
implementing the Loss-DiVincenzo proposal, see the extensive reviews in
Refs. Cerletti:2005a and Coish:2006a.
On the theoretical side, one focus was, and still is, the investigation of the
decoherence induced by the nuclei in the host material via the
hyperfine interaction. The first part of this review article is devoted to
the discussion of the rich spin dynamics that results from the
hyperfine interaction. We first give an introduction to hyperfine
interaction in quantum dots (Sec. ). Subsequently, we
discuss dynamics under the influence of hyperfine
interaction for the case of a single spin in a single
dot (Sec. ) and for a double dot with one electron in
each dot (Sec. ). To conclude the part about
hyperfine interaction, we discuss the idea of narrowing the nuclear
spin state in order to increase the spin coherence time (Sec. ).
The second part of the article is devoted to the dynamics and the
manipulation of heavy-hole spins in quantum dots. The motivation to
study hole spins comes from the fact that the valence band has
FORMULA -symmetry and thus the hyperfine interaction with lattice nuclei
for holes is suppressed in comparison to that of the conduction band
electrons. As a consequence, the main interest for hole spin dynamics
is the relaxation and decoherence due to spin-orbit interaction and we
discuss this in Sec. . The next task towards using
hole spins as qubits for quantum computation is of course the coherent
manipulation of single hole spins. A potentially powerful method to
achieve coherent manipulation of spins is electric dipole spin
resonance (EDSR). An analysis of EDSR for heavy holes in quantum dots
will be presented in Sec. .

Hyperfine interaction for electrons in quantum dots
In this part of the article concerning electron spin decoherence we
assume that the orbital level spacing is much larger than the typical
energy scale of the hyperfine interaction. This is the case in typical
lateral quantum dots containing single electrons and allows one to
write an effective hyperfine Hamiltonian FORMULA  for a
single electron confined to the quantum-dot orbital ground state  FORMULA
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the spin-1/2 operator for a single electron and
FORMULA  is the spin operator for the nuclear spin at lattice
site FORMULA , while FORMULA  is the volume of the crystal unit cell and FORMULA 
is the hyperfine coupling strength. For GaAs, which is mostly used for
the fabrication of lateral dots, the average hyperfine coupling strength
weighted by the natural abundance of each isotope is FORMULA  {{cite:d352831e-0440-4ed5-a6de-fe631ff2798a}}. In Fig. REF  the hyperfine coupling
of the electron spin in a lateral double quantum dot is illustrated.
FIGURE 
The electron spin dynamics under FORMULA  have been studied
under various approximations and in different parameter regimes. For
an extensive overview, see reviews in
Refs. Cerletti:2005a, Schliemann:2003a and Taylor:2006a. Here,
we briefly mention parts of this study before we focus on a few cases
of special interest. The first analysis of electron spin dynamics under
FORMULA  in this context showed that the long-time longitudinal spin-flip
probability is FORMULA  {{cite:4194e43e-dd35-4f33-8e0e-77514f216b3f}}, i.e., this
probability is suppressed
in the limit of large nuclear spin polarization FORMULA  and large number FORMULA 
of nuclear spins in the dot. An exact solution for the case of full
polarization (FORMULA ) gives, for both transverse and longitudinal
electron spin components, a long-time power law decay FORMULA  by a
fraction FORMULA  on a timescale of FORMULA 
(for a GaAs dot with FORMULA ){{cite:79b6d219-55c7-4f82-a7df-cd95c071c009}}. The fact that
this exact solution shows a non-exponential decay demonstrates the
non-Markovian behavior of the nuclear spin bath. For non-fully
polarized systems FORMULA  and in the limit of large magnetic fields
(or high polarization FORMULA ), the transverse electron spin
undergoes a Gaussian decay{{cite:79b6d219-55c7-4f82-a7df-cd95c071c009}}, {{cite:dcd6f96a-f6a1-4d46-8f95-10d01214504b}} on a
timescale FORMULA  (FORMULA 
for GaAs with FORMULA  and FORMULA ){{cite:d48c2e14-d45c-421b-9e8e-2fbfd1040f4d}}. This Gaussian
decay can be reversed using a spin-echo sequence or by preparing the nuclear
spin system in an eigenstate of FORMULA  {{cite:d48c2e14-d45c-421b-9e8e-2fbfd1040f4d}}.
Several methods to prepare
the nuclear spin system have recently been suggested
{{cite:206da1e6-2428-4164-90ad-4c04653bc938}}, {{cite:89bfe610-7d73-45ec-9cc5-421c592df2d8}}, {{cite:86f3905f-0de3-4790-a8c4-a56a1e690b21}} and we discuss
one of these methods {{cite:89bfe610-7d73-45ec-9cc5-421c592df2d8}} in
Sec. . Once the nuclear spin system is prepared in an
eigenstate, the electron spin coherence is
on one hand limited by dynamics in the nuclear spin system driven by
the dipole-dipole interaction for which a
worst case estimate {{cite:89bfe610-7d73-45ec-9cc5-421c592df2d8}} gives FORMULA  and on
the other hand, even for an eigenstate of FORMULA , there is decoherence
due to the flip-flop dynamics which can be important at times FORMULA  (or less, depending on the size of the electron Zeeman
splitting). For the decay of nuclear spin polarization experiments
suggest timescales up to tens of seconds{{cite:f0741133-3ed6-426f-8789-363b3cc448f0}}, {{cite:2a31caa4-f509-4aa7-9b91-66d538a1d4b5}}, {{cite:9f040e87-41eb-49ce-be6e-7724e78829f5}}, {{cite:e5e8062e-1c09-459c-9c41-bc3c83714724}} and hysteretic behavior of the
nuclear spin polarization with respect to the external magnetic field
has been observed {{cite:c94ede9d-87e9-41cc-8429-19b4ec9f71fc}}. Further, measurements of the
transport current in the so-called spin-blockade regime {{cite:f15190a5-96ca-457b-a205-2286ef3299b3}}
revealed hysteretic behavior with respect to the magnetic field {{cite:71ff723a-56ed-43eb-a9f8-5011d9b4ec58}}, {{cite:f0741133-3ed6-426f-8789-363b3cc448f0}}
and bistable behavior in time{{cite:f0741133-3ed6-426f-8789-363b3cc448f0}}, which is attributed to a
bistability in the nuclear spin polarization.
Further, very recent experiments suggest a
strong dependence of the nuclear field correlation time depending on whether
an electron is present in the dot or not and thus hyperfine mediated nuclear
spin flips are a possible mechanism for nuclear spin
diffusion{{cite:2a31caa4-f509-4aa7-9b91-66d538a1d4b5}}. This last mechanism has been
estimated to lead to fluctuations of nuclear spin polarization
on a timescale of  FORMULA{{cite:89bfe610-7d73-45ec-9cc5-421c592df2d8}}.

Single-electron spin decoherence
In this section we look in more detail at hyperfine-induced decoherence for a
single spin in a quantum dot in the regime of large Zeeman splitting
FORMULA  (due to an externally applied magnetic
field FORMULA ). If FORMULA  is much larger than
FORMULA ,
with FORMULA  (where FORMULA  is the density
matrix of the nuclear spin system), we may neglect the transverse term
FORMULA  and find that the Hamiltonian is simply
FORMULA 
This Hamiltonian just induces precession around the FORMULA -axis with a
frequency that is determined by the eigenvalue FORMULA  of FORMULA , where
FORMULA . For a large but
finite number of nuclear spins (FORMULA  for lateral GaAs dots)
the eigenvalues FORMULA  are Gaussian distributed (due to the central
limit theorem) with mean FORMULA  and variance FORMULA 
{{cite:d48c2e14-d45c-421b-9e8e-2fbfd1040f4d}}.
Calculating the dynamics under FORMULA  (which is valid up to a
timescale of FORMULA , where the transverse
terms become relevant) leads to a Gaussian decay of the transverse electron
spin state FORMULA 
{{cite:d48c2e14-d45c-421b-9e8e-2fbfd1040f4d}}:
FORMULA 
Here again, FORMULA  denotes the polarization and for an unpolarized GaAs
quantum dot with FORMULA  we find FORMULA .
Applying an additional ac driving field with amplitude FORMULA  along the FORMULA -direction leads to
single-spin ESR. Assuming again that
FORMULA , we have the Hamiltonian
FORMULA 
In a rotating-wave approximation (which is valid for
FORMULA ) the decay of the driven Rabi oscillations is
given by{{cite:fefa9799-e15d-44d6-9b08-0b764eca09e4}}
FORMULA 
for FORMULA  and
FORMULA . Here,
FORMULA  is defined in the same way as
FORMULA  in Eq. (REF ). The time-independent constant is
given by FORMULA .
The two interesting features of the decay are the slow (FORMULA ) power law and the universal phase shift of
FORMULA . The fact that the power law already becomes valid after a
short time FORMULA  (for FORMULA ) preserves the coherence over a long
time, which makes the Rabi oscillations visible even when the Rabi
period is much longer than the timescale FORMULA  for
transverse spin decay. Both the universal phase shift and the
non-exponential decay have recently been observed in experiment
{{cite:fefa9799-e15d-44d6-9b08-0b764eca09e4}}.
In order to take corrections due to the transverse terms
FORMULA  into account, a more elaborate
calculation is required. The Hamiltonian with flip-flop terms (but
without a driving field) takes the form
FORMULA 
In Ref. Coish:2004a a systematic
calculation taking into account these so-called flip-flop terms was
performed using a generalized master equation, valid in the limit of
large magnetic field or large polarization. This calculation shows that
even for an eigenstate of FORMULA , for which the Gaussian decay in
Eq. (REF ) vanishes, the electron spin undergoes nontrivial
non-Markovian decay on a timescale FORMULA .
Other calculations {{cite:836e526e-ca6f-4c02-b892-9eb9424edb1b}}, {{cite:88b2ab18-fc08-4572-bba2-0d99168a3824}}, {{cite:15cca7e2-e08a-481e-8819-bbb173a4548f}} give
microsecond timescales for the electron spin decoherence due to electron-nuclear
spin flip-flops processes. The results in Ref. Yao:2005a suggest that also the
decoherence due to dynamics in the nuclear spin system via
electron mediated nuclear dipole-dipole interaction is suppressed by a
spin echo and thus that the spin-echo decay time may be considerably
different from the (not ensemble averaged) free-induction decay.

Singlet-triplet decoherence in a double quantum
qot
We now move on to discuss hyperfine induced decoherence in a double
quantum dot. The effective Hamiltonian in the subspace
of one electron on each dot is best written in terms of the sum and
difference of electron spin and collective nuclear spin operators:
FORMULA 
and FORMULA :
FORMULA 
Here, FORMULA  is the Heisenberg exchange coupling between the two
electron spins. Similar to the single-dot case, we assume that the
Zeeman splitting is much larger than FORMULA  and FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the
root-mean-square expectation value of the operator FORMULA 
with respect to the nuclear spin state FORMULA . Under these
conditions the relevant spin Hamiltonian becomes block diagonal with
blocks labeled by the total electron spin projection along the
magnetic field FORMULA . In the subspace of FORMULA  (singlet
FORMULA , and triplet FORMULA ) the Hamiltonian can
be written as {{cite:762f2c99-fe52-4560-b4b5-30a2b3ff9a6e}}, {{cite:89bfe610-7d73-45ec-9cc5-421c592df2d8}}
FORMULA 
Here, FORMULA  is the inhomogeneity of the externally
applied classical static magnetic field with FORMULA , while the nuclear difference field FORMULA  is Gaussian
distributed, as was FORMULA  in the single dot case. A full account of the
rich pseudo-spin dynamics under
FORMULA  can be
found in Refs. Klauser:2006a and Coish:2005a. Here we only discuss
the most prominent features for FORMULA , which gives
the probability to find the singlet FORMULA , if the system was initialized to
FORMULA  at FORMULA . The parameters that determine the
dynamics are the exchange coupling FORMULA , the expectation value of the
total difference field FORMULA  and the width of
the difference field FORMULA  (with FORMULA  and
FORMULA ). For the asymptotics one finds that
the singlet probability does not decay to zero, but goes to a finite,
parameter-dependent value {{cite:762f2c99-fe52-4560-b4b5-30a2b3ff9a6e}}. In the case of strong
exchange coupling FORMULA  the singlet
only decays by a small fraction
quadratic in FORMULA  or FORMULA :
FORMULA 
At short times FORMULA  undergoes a Gaussian decay on a
timescale FORMULA  while at long
times FORMULA  we have a power law decay
FORMULA 
As in the case of single-spin ESR, we again have a power-law decay, now
with FORMULA  and a universal phase shift, in this case:
FORMULA . Measurements{{cite:07eb1492-bfb8-4a58-be6b-b5b3a8522431}} of the correlator FORMULA 
confirmed the parameter dependence of the saturation value and were
consistent with the theoretical predictions concerning the decay.
Using the same methods, one may also look at transverse correlators in
the FORMULA  subspace and find again power-law decays and a universal
phase shift, albeit, with different decay power and different value
of the universal phase shift{{cite:89bfe610-7d73-45ec-9cc5-421c592df2d8}}. Looking at the
short-time behavior of the transverse correlators also allows one to
analyze the fidelity of the FORMULA  gate{{cite:89bfe610-7d73-45ec-9cc5-421c592df2d8}}.

Nuclear spin state narrowing
The idea to prepare the nuclear spin system in order to prolong the
electron spin coherence was put forward in
Ref. Coish:2005a. Specific methods for nuclear spin state
narrowing have been described in Ref. Klauser:2006a in the
context of a double dot with oscillating exchange interaction, in
Ref. Giedke:2006a for phase-estimation of a single (undriven)
spin in a single dot and in an optical setup in
Ref. Stepanenko:2006a. Here, we discuss narrowing for the case of
a driven single spin in a single dot, for which the details are very
similar to the treatment in Ref. Klauser:2006a. The general idea behind state
narrowing is that the evolution of the electron spin system depends on the value of the
nuclear field since the effective Zeeman splitting is given by FORMULA .
This leads to a nuclear field dependent resonance condition FORMULA 
for ESR and thus measuring the evolution of the electron spin system determines FORMULA  and thus
the nuclear spin state.
We start from the Hamiltonian for single-spin ESR as given in
Eq. (REF ). The electron spin is initialized to the
FORMULA  state at time FORMULA  and evolves under FORMULA 
up to a measurement performed at time FORMULA . The probability to find
FORMULA  for a given eigenvalue FORMULA  of the nuclear
field operator (FORMULA ) is then given by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  is the amplitude of
the driving field. As mentioned above, in equilibrium we have a
Gaussian distribution for the eigenvalues FORMULA , i.e., for the
diagonal elements of the nuclear spin density matrix FORMULA .
Thus, averaged over the nuclear distribution we have the probability
FORMULA  to find the state FORMULA , i.e.,
FORMULA .
After one measurement with outcome FORMULA , we thus find for
the diagonal of the nuclear spin density matrix {{cite:7f6b88fc-3735-4774-9943-f8db227bfda4}}
FORMULA 
Assuming now that the measurement is performed in
such a way that it gives the time averaged value (i.e., with a time
resolution less than FORMULA ) we have for the probability
FORMULA  of measurement result FORMULA  as a
function of the nuclear field eigenvalue FORMULA . Thus, by performing a
measurement on the electron spin (with outcome FORMULA ),
the nuclear-spin density matrix is
multiplied by a Lorentzian with width FORMULA  centered around the FORMULA  that satisfies the resonance condition
FORMULA . This results in a narrowed nuclear
spin distribution, and thus an extension of the electron spin
coherence, if FORMULA .
In the case of measurement outcome FORMULA  we find
FORMULA 
i.e., the Gaussian nuclear spin distribution
is multiplied by one minus a Lorentzian, thus reducing the probability
for the nuclear field to have a value matching the resonance
condition FORMULA . Due to the slow dynamics of the nuclear spin system (see
discussion at the end of Sec. ), many
such measurements of the electron spin are possible (with
re-initialization of the electron spin between measurements). Under the
assumption of a static nuclear field during FORMULA  such initialization
and measurement cycles we find
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the number of times the measurement
outcome was FORMULA . The simplest way to narrow is to
perform single measurements with FORMULA . If
the outcome is FORMULA , narrowing has been achieved.
Otherwise, the nuclear system should be allowed to re-equilibrate before the
next measurement{{cite:8ad3d8b3-e581-4ae7-945a-a356ea9d10c1}}. In order to achieve a systematic
narrowing, one can envision adapting the driving frequency (and thus
the resonance condition) depending on the outcome of the previous
measurements. Such an adaptive scheme is described in detail in
Refs. Stepanenko:2006a and Klauser:2006a. With
this we conclude the part on hyperfine-induced decoherence of electron
spins in quantum dots and move on to the heavy holes.

Spin decoherence and relaxation for heavy holes
Now we consider the spin coherence of heavy holes in quantum dots. The
contact hyperfine interaction between lattice nuclei and heavy-hole
spin is much weaker than that for electrons, since the valence band
has FORMULA  symmetry. Thus (neglecting FORMULA  hybridization) only the weaker anisotropic hyperfine interaction is present. Therefore, the decoherence due to hyperfine
interaction is suppressed for heavy holes and in this section we focus
only on the spin decoherence due to spin-orbit interaction induced by
heavy-hole - phonon coupling.
From the two-band Kane model, the Hamiltonian for the valence band of
III–V semiconductors is given by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian
{{cite:269cbe7e-da72-4ea6-820d-dda071f0f32f}}. The second term is the Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling (due
to bulk inversion asymmetry) for the valence band {{cite:e49d7720-313d-4421-a42c-d08fbe867fd4}}, {{cite:2c10b7c1-17d0-43ab-8711-741c5beed5d2}},
FORMULA  are FORMULA  matrices corresponding to
spin FORMULA , FORMULA , and
FORMULA , FORMULA  are given by cyclic permutations. The last term
in Eq. (REF ) FORMULA  is the Zeeman term
for the valence band {{cite:1cfc8c8a-3db9-4ab3-b25d-c6051b983138}} (FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are the Luttinger parameters {{cite:1cfc8c8a-3db9-4ab3-b25d-c6051b983138}} and
FORMULA ).
FIGURE 
We consider a FORMULA -grown two-dimensional system. In the case of an
asymmetric quantum well, due
to structure inversion asymmetry along the growth direction, there is
an additional spin-orbit term, the Bychkov-Rashba spin-orbit term,
which, in the two-band model is given
by {{cite:ecea4fdb-3b51-41b0-8e2f-5c4ec31f3af1}} FORMULA , where
FORMULA  is the Bychkov-Rashba spin-orbit coupling constant and
FORMULA  is an effective electric field along the growth
direction.
Due to confinement along the growth direction, the valence
band splits into a heavy-hole subband with FORMULA  and a
light-hole subband with FORMULA  (see
Fig. REF  and Ref. BLPRL2005). If the
splitting FORMULA  of heavy-hole and light-hole subbands is
large, we describe the properties of heavy-holes and light-holes
separately, using only the FORMULA  submatrices for the
FORMULA  and FORMULA  states, respectively. The heavy-hole
submatrices have the property that
FORMULA  and FORMULA . For such a system and
low temperatures, only the lowest heavy-hole subband is significantly
occupied. In this case, we consider heavy holes
only. In the framework of perturbation theory {{cite:e49d7720-313d-4421-a42c-d08fbe867fd4}}, using
Eq. (REF ) and taking into account the Zeeman
energy and the Bychkov-Rashba spin-orbit coupling term, the
effective Hamiltonian for heavy holes of a quantum dot with lateral
confinement potential FORMULA  is given
by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the effective heavy-hole mass,
FORMULA ,
FORMULA , FORMULA  is the
component of the FORMULA -factor tensor along the growth direction, and
FORMULA 
is the spin-orbit coupling of heavy holes consisting of three
contributions: the Dresselhaus term (FORMULA ) {{cite:2c10b7c1-17d0-43ab-8711-741c5beed5d2}}, the
Rashba term (FORMULA ) {{cite:524d4c88-f7d8-4f0c-9de1-056831b6a3f2}}, and the last term
(FORMULA ) combines two effects: orbital coupling via non-diagonal
elements in the Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian (FORMULA ) and
magnetic coupling via non-diagonal elements in the Zeeman term
(FORMULA ). This latter term represents a new type of
spin-orbit interaction which is unique for heavy holes
{{cite:0a55208e-48a9-45e5-b3f2-1ef8ad6fa281}}. Here, FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA ,

quantum dot, and FORMULA  is the splitting of light-hole and
heavy-hole
subbands. The splitting between heavy-hole and light-hole subbands

The spectrum of (REF ) for parabolic lateral confinement FORMULA 
and for vanishing spin-orbit interaction
(FORMULA ) is the Fock-Darwin spectrum split
by the Zeeman term {{cite:046dd867-9635-4907-9c1b-adb5506ea52e}}, {{cite:5f2120d3-85ac-4598-b0a6-06c607b55e80}}. From Eq. (REF ), it can
be seen that FORMULA  leads to coupling of the
two lowest states FORMULA  to the states with the opposite
spin orientations and different orbital momenta
FORMULA . Note that the three spin-orbit terms in
Eq. (REF ) differ by symmetry in momentum space and hence mix
different states resulting in avoided crossings of the energy levels
(see inset of Fig. REF ). Due to this spin-orbit mixing of the
heavy-hole states, the transitions between the states
FORMULA  with emission or absorption of an acoustic phonon
become possible and this is the main source of spin relaxation and
decoherence for heavy-holes {{cite:2c10b7c1-17d0-43ab-8711-741c5beed5d2}}.
We consider a single-particle quantum dot, in which a heavy hole can
occupy one of the low-lying levels. In the following, we study the
relaxation of an FORMULA -level system, the first FORMULA  levels have the
same spin and the FORMULA -th
level has the opposite spin orientation. In the framework of Bloch-Redfield theory {{cite:56f4428b-cf58-4d36-8634-8d7ba1a44e7b}}, the Bloch equations for heavy-hole
spin motion for such a system in the interaction representation are given by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA ,
FORMULA  is the density matrix, FORMULA  is the
transition rate from state FORMULA  to state FORMULA , FORMULA  is a constant
(which has the value of FORMULA  in thermodynamic
equilibrium if FORMULA ),
FORMULA 
where pure dephasing (due to fluctuations along FORMULA  direction) is
absent in the spin decoherence time FORMULA  since the spectral function
is superohmic.
As can be seen from Eq. (REF ), the spin motion has a complex
dependence on the density matrix and, in the general
case, there are FORMULA  spin relaxation rates. However, in the case of
low temperatures (FORMULA ), when
phonon absorption becomes strongly suppressed, solving the master
equation, we find that FORMULA . Therefore, there is only one spin relaxation time FORMULA . In this
limit, the last sum in Eq. (REF ) is
negligible and the spin decoherence time saturates, i.e., FORMULA .
Note that in contrast to electrons {{cite:9da8bcc7-38be-421c-9e07-19a71670d5ca}} there are no
interference effects between different spin-orbit coupling terms,
thus the total spin relaxation rate FORMULA  is the sum of rates
FORMULA 
{{cite:2c10b7c1-17d0-43ab-8711-741c5beed5d2}}, {{cite:0a55208e-48a9-45e5-b3f2-1ef8ad6fa281}}:

In Fig. REF  the total spin relaxation rate FORMULA  is plotted
as a function of perpendicular magnetic field FORMULA . There are
three peaks in the relaxation rate curve at
FORMULA , and FORMULA , which are
caused by strong spin mixing at the anticrossing points. In the inset,
the first (third) avoided crossing resulting from Dresselhaus (Rashba)
spin-orbit coupling corresponds to the first (third) peak of the spin
relaxation curve in Fig. REF . At non-zero in-plane magnetic
fields (FORMULA ), there is an additional peak which is due to an
anticrossing between the energy levels FORMULA  and FORMULA 
(see the second avoided crossing in the inset). Note that the spin
relaxation rate for heavy holes is comparable to that for electrons
{{cite:2c10b7c1-17d0-43ab-8711-741c5beed5d2}}, {{cite:eeb0f520-4e49-435f-b3da-3d3d2a1e697a}} due to the fact that spin-orbit coupling of
heavy holes is strongly suppressed for flat quantum dots (see
Eq. (REF )), as confirmed by a recent experiment {{cite:0ec44a8d-37f6-4918-8724-1b6025911efe}}.

Electric dipole spin resonance for heavy holes
Let us now consider methods for the manipulation and detection of
the heavy-hole spin in quantum dots. For electrons in two-dimensional
structures, an applied oscillating in-plane magnetic field couples
spin-up and spin-down states via magnetic-dipole transitions and is
commonly used in electron spin resonance, Rabi oscillation, and spin
echo experiments {{cite:d880a50c-925f-49e5-a4a2-e78e55aee554}}. It can be shown that
magnetic-dipole transitions (FORMULA , FORMULA , and
FORMULA ) are forbidden and, due to spin-orbit mixing of the
states FORMULA  with FORMULA ,
electric-dipole transitions (FORMULA , FORMULA , and
FORMULA ) are most likely to occur.
Therefore, the heavy holes are affected by the oscillating electric
field component and not by the magnetic one.
We consider a circularly polarized electric field rotating in the
XY-plane with frequency FORMULA : FORMULA . Therefore, the interaction of heavy holes with
the electric field is described by the Hamiltonian
FORMULA . The coupling
between the states FORMULA  is given by
FORMULA , where
FORMULA 
is an effective dipole moment of a heavy hole depending on Dresselhaus
spin-orbit coupling constants, perpendicular magnetic field FORMULA ,
lateral size of a quantum dot, and frequency FORMULA  of an rf electric field.
In the framework of the Bloch-Redfield theory {{cite:56f4428b-cf58-4d36-8634-8d7ba1a44e7b}} (taking
into account also off-diagonal matrix elements), the effective master
equation for the density matrix FORMULA  assumes the form of Bloch
equations {{cite:56f4428b-cf58-4d36-8634-8d7ba1a44e7b}}, with the detuning of the rf field given by
FORMULA .
FORMULA  is
the Larmor frequency, FORMULA  the spin relaxation
time (FORMULA  is the transition rate from state FORMULA  to state FORMULA ),
FORMULA  {{cite:2c10b7c1-17d0-43ab-8711-741c5beed5d2}} the spin decoherence time, and
FORMULA  the equilibrium value of FORMULA 
without rf field.
The coupling energy between a heavy hole and an oscillating electric
field is given by
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
is the dipole moment of a heavy hole. Therefore, the rf power FORMULA  absorbed by
a heavy-hole spin system in the stationary state is given by
{{cite:c88e95d8-315f-4943-a52e-dfa3a11865c5}}
FORMULA 
In Fig. REF , the dependence of FORMULA  on a perpendicular magnetic
field FORMULA  and frequency FORMULA  of the oscillating electric
field is plotted. The rf power FORMULA  absorbed by the system has three
resonances and one resonant dip. The first resonance appears when the
energy of rf radiation equals the Zeeman energy of heavy holes:
FORMULA . The shape
of this resonance (at certain FORMULA ) is given by
FORMULA .
FIGURE 
If the first and second resonances are well separated
(FORMULA ), then the absorbed power can be estimated as
FORMULA 
in the region of the second and third resonances and the resonant
dip. The second resonance corresponds to an anticrossing of the levels
FORMULA  and FORMULA  (see the first avoided crossing in the inset
of Fig. REF ) at FORMULA  {{cite:2c10b7c1-17d0-43ab-8711-741c5beed5d2}}
(at FORMULA ). At the anticrossing point, there is
strong mixing of the spin-up and spin-down states and the dipole
moment of a heavy-hole spin system is maximal
FORMULA  and
equals half of the lowest electric dipole moment of a quantum dot
(FORMULA ). Therefore, the height of the second resonance
is given by
FORMULA . The
resonant dip appears at
FORMULA , which corresponds to FORMULA 
and to zero dipole moment (see Eq. (REF )). The third
resonance reflects the peak in the spin decoherence rate FORMULA 
due to an applied in-plane magnetic field (see Fig. REF ) at the
second anticrossing point (the second avoided crossing in inset of
Fig. REF ) at FORMULA 
(FORMULA ). From the positions of the resonances we can determine
FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA , from the shape and the height of those
we can extract information about the spin-orbit interaction constants
FORMULA , FORMULA , and spin-orbit interaction strength due to in-plane
magnetic field (which is proportional to
FORMULA ). Moreover, we can determine the dependence of
the spin relaxation and decoherence times on FORMULA .

Conclusions
We have discussed the rich dynamics of single electron spins in single and
double quantum dots due to hyperfine interaction with the nuclei. Key
features are non-exponential decays of various kinds and a remarkable universal
phase-shift. Further, we have studied spin decoherence and relaxation
of heavy holes in quantum dots due to spin-orbit coupling. The spin
relaxation time FORMULA  for heavy holes in flat quantum dots can be
comparable to that for electrons {{cite:2c10b7c1-17d0-43ab-8711-741c5beed5d2}}, {{cite:eeb0f520-4e49-435f-b3da-3d3d2a1e697a}} as confirmed by experiment {{cite:0ec44a8d-37f6-4918-8724-1b6025911efe}}. The spin
decoherence time for heavy holes is given by FORMULA  at low temperatures. There is strong spin
mixing at energy-level crossings resulting in a non-monotonic dependence
FORMULA . We have proposed a new method for manipulation of a
heavy-hole spin in a quantum dot via rf electric fields. This method
can be used for detection of heavy-hole spin resonance signals, for spin manipulation, and for determining important parameters of
heavy holes {{cite:0a55208e-48a9-45e5-b3f2-1ef8ad6fa281}}.
