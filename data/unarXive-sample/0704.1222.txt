Spectrum of the neutrinos produced in the massive photon
and longitudal plasmon decay process has been computed
with four levels of approximation for the dispersion
relations. Some analytical formulae in limiting cases
are derived. Interesting conclusions related to previous
calculations of the energy loss in stars are presented.
High energy tail of the neutrino spectrum is shown
to be proportional to exp(-E/kT), where E is the neutrino
energy and kT is the temperature of the plasma.

Introduction & Motivation
Thermal neutrino loses from plasma are
very important for stellar astrophysics {{cite:333b4160-80bf-4d79-abbd-b1e534f86f85}}, {{cite:12bf2f65-3dfd-42f0-a90b-bd82122cabad}}.
Plasmon decay is one of the three main reactions.
Extensive calculations for these processes were
done by group of Itoh
{{cite:b5ac19d9-7de2-42be-b6fa-83720552c308}}, {{cite:793cb319-6449-4caa-8f4f-37ec5dc24fa6}}, {{cite:290f460d-5202-42fb-b093-a15edac0377b}}, {{cite:78367e9f-d4be-4986-a6d0-c8f651631885}}, {{cite:61636a21-e3e7-452f-bd78-111664a3a89f}}, {{cite:50af04ac-e3d3-4b28-8d10-2f361720ff7e}}, {{cite:d82774f5-b9f0-4ed2-9747-4f5e3594c65c}}, {{cite:6f81383a-9489-473d-8bd2-445bbc991f97}}, {{cite:a00d2104-3130-44d4-87f6-4f48a9ce53f2}}.

Meanwhile, our abilities
to detect neutrinos has grown by many orders of magnitude,
beginning with FORMULA  tonne experiment of Reines&Cowan {{cite:ec69adcf-560b-4888-be8f-d42fd1c62af0}} up to
the biggest existing now 50 kt Super-Kamiokande detector {{cite:3f269487-f4d5-4a74-99c5-a2fc5d853f4b}}.
Recently, ”GADZOOKS!” upgrade to Super-Kamiokande proposed by Beacom&Vagins {{cite:44dd378f-8c09-407c-8485-51244a0c14f7}}
attract attention of both experimental and theoretical physicists. At last
one new source of the astrophysical antineutrinos is guaranteed
with this upgrade, namely Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background {{cite:c643088d-9710-446f-8237-9d5b44d7fd7d}}, {{cite:31470daa-b4c5-431c-9cec-cb87b36f28d1}}.
Pre-supernova stars will be available to observations
out to FORMULA 2 kiloparsecs {{cite:c643088d-9710-446f-8237-9d5b44d7fd7d}}.
This technique is the only extensible to megaton scale {{cite:c643088d-9710-446f-8237-9d5b44d7fd7d}}.
Memphys, Hyper-Kamiokande and UNO (Mt-scale water Cherenkov detectors cf. e.g.
{{cite:8d8f15a0-b144-4028-9736-9c6c5cf8e34e}})
proposals now seriously consider to add GdClFORMULA  to the one of the tanks with
typical three-tank design {{cite:84ce4be0-61d8-4a4d-9a73-84c9f54e1307}}.
Recently, the discussion on the geoneutrino detection {{cite:3ca92bad-3c36-43d3-8b19-992f42a7800c}},
increased attention
to the deep underwater neutrino observatories {{cite:6cc4ec71-0a54-42a6-88b4-df8836e71a2b}} with target mass
5-10 Mt {{cite:c643088d-9710-446f-8237-9d5b44d7fd7d}} and even bigger {{cite:0294e716-13f5-498e-bf22-60a15444652c}}.
It seems that (anti)neutrino astronomy is on our doorstep,
but numerous astrophysical sources of the FORMULA 's still are
not analyzed from the detection point of view.
Detection of the solar {{cite:8551a315-2bf5-4b4e-9ae2-9d972c89ce06}}, {{cite:81184293-61c4-4885-9d84-74e626f9be57}}, {{cite:f9c698c4-d94d-4f81-b9c1-f5d85ec797be}}, {{cite:8a54735e-0450-4106-8892-6613a7709eca}} and supernova neutrinos
{{cite:73d9dc87-ed56-47c5-915b-41808023232d}}, {{cite:c7d28f0c-f3ac-4288-b349-bd396c0ddc37}}, {{cite:fc73373c-3238-47d9-bf4f-9b4f8cba8e35}}, {{cite:4baf8919-ecb9-4e36-9361-10e5bfab6ecd}}
was accompanied and followed with extensive set of detailed
calculations (see e.g. {{cite:f2c44c98-6fa6-4fd0-99bc-058d5b35ddfe}}, {{cite:7a7f4bf5-06cd-4360-9cec-ca7434b628bf}}, {{cite:468cb756-3726-4de6-9ddd-c808e286f643}}, {{cite:eae0037b-2b04-4f09-9ac5-45299b30909f}}, {{cite:625f4fe3-b159-43b0-9a42-b6a5ffd35e8f}}, {{cite:664d8455-bc11-4e5a-8c4c-1d8548bcd96c}}
and references therein as a representatives of this broad subject)
of the neutrino spectrum. On the contrary, very little
is known about spectral neutrino emission from other astrophysical
objects. Usually, some analytical representation of the spectrum
is used, based on earlier experience
and numerical simulations, cf. e.g. {{cite:1c80dca9-04fa-4dbb-b76d-d6ef36ac5fb9}}.
While this approach is justified for supernovae, where neutrinos
are trapped, other astrophysical
objects are transparent to neutrinos, and spectrum can be
computed with an arbitrary precision.
Our goal is to compute neutrino spectra as exact as possible and fill this gap.
Plasmaneutrino process dominates dense, degenerate objects
like red giant cores {{cite:a5beabd1-16c5-4bc2-ba79-376d8be689be}}, cooling white dwarfs {{cite:48d9ebc4-e248-4bcd-9116-12bb0bcd1eac}} including
Ia supernova progenitors before so-called ,,smoldering” phase {{cite:174be993-ddbf-43a5-80fa-8bf2001b5af2}}. It is also
important secondary cooling process in e.g. neutron star crusts {{cite:0a83f189-becf-493f-a508-53ccc4c8f3a5}}
and massive stars {{cite:99c35f9c-9f85-4bba-8d3d-f50840255754}}.
Unfortunately, thermal neutrino loses
usually are calculated using methods completely erasing almost any
information related to the neutrino energy FORMULA  and directionality
as well. This information is not required to compute total energy FORMULA  radiated
as neutrinos per unit volume and time.
From experimental point of view, however, it is extremely
important if given amount of energy is radiated as e.g. numerous
keV neutrinos or one 10 MeV neutrino. In the first case
we are unable to detect (using available techniques) any transient neutrino source
regardless of the total luminosity and proximity of the object. In the second
case we can detect astrophysical neutrino sources if they are
strong and not too far away using advanced detector which is big enough.
Few of the research articles in this area attempt to estimate
average neutrino energy {{cite:dbf26b53-33f2-4a60-8a8c-5cad2bcb75d0}}, {{cite:7d0d22a4-f2bc-4856-ae9a-9cf5dca9fa7b}}, {{cite:d4945d16-64a6-418f-a776-5cc6909a6ef8}}, {{cite:ad3cb2ac-ff40-43c2-886a-f47d77624976}}
computing additionally reaction rate FORMULA . Strangely, they presented
figures and formulae for FORMULA  instead of FORMULA . This gives
false picture of real situation, as former expression gives
FORMULA .
Obviously, we detect neutrinos not FORMULA -FORMULA  pairs.
FORMULA  do not
give average neutrino energy, as in general neutrino
and antineutrino spectra are different. As we will see
only for longitudal plasmon decay neutrinos energies
of neutrinos and antineutrinos are equal. However, difference
in all situations where thermal neutrino loses are important is numerically
small and formula:
FORMULA 
is still a ”working” estimate.
Mean neutrino energy is useful in the purpose of qualitative discussion
of the detection prospects/methods. Quantitative discussion require knowledge
of spectrum shape (differential emissivity FORMULA ).
High energy tail is particularly important from an experimental
detection point of view. Detection of the lowest energy neutrinos is extremely
challenging due to numerous background signal noise sources e.g. FORMULA C
decay for FORMULA  keV {{cite:8d5481ea-3b21-44c4-9b76-89cf4c910437}}.
Relevant calculations for the spectrum of the medium energy
FORMULA MeV
neutrinos emitted from thermal processes has become available
recently {{cite:d4945d16-64a6-418f-a776-5cc6909a6ef8}}, {{cite:ad3cb2ac-ff40-43c2-886a-f47d77624976}}, {{cite:b66758f2-d9eb-49c7-856d-93c9c49eac42}}. Purpose of this article is
to develop accurate methods and discuss various theoretical and practical
(important for detection) aspects of the neutrino spectra from astrophysical plasma process.
This could help experimental physicists to discuss possible realistic
approach to detect astrophysical sources of the neutrinos in the future.

Plasmaneutrino spectrum
Properties of plasmons
Emissivity and the spectrum shape from the plasmon decay is strongly affected by the dispersion relation
for transverse plasmons (massive in-medium photons) and longitudal
plasmons. In contrast to transverse plasmons, with vacuum dispersion relation
FORMULA , longitudal plasmons exist only in the plasma.
Dispersion relation, by the definition is a function
FORMULA  where FORMULA  is the energy of the (quasi)particle
and FORMULA  is the momentum.
Issues related to particular handling of these functions
are discussed clearly in the article of Braaten and Segel {{cite:fc807455-1cd3-46c6-b814-8682ac43bd4a}}.
We will repeat here the most important features of the plasmons.
For both types, plasmon energy for momentum FORMULA  is equal to FORMULA .
Value FORMULA  is refereed to as plasma frequency
and can be computed from:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA , FORMULA  (FORMULA  units are used),
FORMULA  MeV and
fine structure constant is FORMULA  {{cite:a875226b-d5b0-45c2-90af-36f494b14fe5}}.
Functions FORMULA  and FORMULA 
are the Fermi-Dirac distributions for electrons and positrons, respectively:
FORMULA 
Quantity FORMULA  is the electron chemical potential (including the rest mass).
Other important parameters include first relativistic correction
FORMULA :
FORMULA 
maximum longitudal plasmon momentum (energy) FORMULA :
FORMULA 
and asymptotic transverse plasmon mass FORMULA :
FORMULA 
Value FORMULA  is often referred to as thermal photon mass.
We also define parameter FORMULA :
FORMULA 
interpreted as typical velocity of the electrons in the plasma {{cite:fc807455-1cd3-46c6-b814-8682ac43bd4a}}.
Axial polarization coefficient is:
FORMULA 
Value of the FORMULA  is a measure of the difference between
neutrino and antineutrino spectra.
Set of numerical values used
to display sample result

Typical example of the exact plasmon dispersion relations (dash-dotted) is presented in
Fig. REF .
As solving eqns. (REF , REF ) with (REF )
is computationally intensive, three levels
of approximation for dispersion relations are widely used:

zero-order analytical approximations

first order relativistic corrections

Braaten&Segel approximation

Approximations for longitudal plasmons
For longitudal plasmons, the simplest zero-order approach
used in early calculations of Adams et al. {{cite:3f3418cf-2702-490b-8400-e35ad042e836}}
and more recently in {{cite:ad3cb2ac-ff40-43c2-886a-f47d77624976}} for photoneutrino process is to put simply:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the plasma frequency (REF ).
Maximum plasmon energy FORMULA  in this approximation.
Zero-order approximation is valid only for non-relativistic regime,
and leads to large errors of the total emissivity {{cite:05ce1a06-e3be-4ac2-87b7-f6a3009feb5e}}.
First relativistic correction to (REF )
has been introduced by Beaudet et al. {{cite:05ce1a06-e3be-4ac2-87b7-f6a3009feb5e}}. Dispersion relation FORMULA 
is given in an implicit form:
FORMULA 
with maximum plasmon energy equal to:
FORMULA 
This approximation, however, do not introduce really serious
improvement (Figs. REF , REF  (left) & REF ). Breaking point was publication
of the Braaten&Segel approximation {{cite:fc807455-1cd3-46c6-b814-8682ac43bd4a}}. Using simple analytical equation:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is defined in (REF ) one is able to
get almost exact dispersion relation, cf.
Figs. REF  & REF , left panels.
Solution to the eq. (REF ) exist in the range FORMULA ,
where, in this approximation, maximum longitudal plasmon momentum is:
FORMULA 
what gives value slightly different than exact value
(Fig. REF , left),
but required for consistency of the approximation.

Approximations for transverse plasmons
For photons in vacuum dispersion relation is FORMULA . Zero order
approximation for in-medium photons is:
FORMULA 
valid for small FORMULA  and:
FORMULA 

valid for very large FORMULA . Formulae (REF ) and
(REF ) provide
lower and upper limit for realistic FORMULA , respectively
(cf. Fig. REF , right panel, dotted).
First order relativistic corrections lead to the formula:
FORMULA 
with asymptotic photon mass:
FORMULA 
Finally, Braaten&Segel approximation leads to:
FORMULA 
Asymptotic photon mass FORMULA  derived from (REF ) is:
FORMULA 
This is slightly smaller (left panel of Fig. REF , dashed)
than exact value (solid line).
All four relations are presented in Fig. REF .
Differences are clearly visible, but they are much less
pronounced for transverse than for longitudal plasmons. Inspection of Fig. REF 
reveals however, that in the large momentum regime asymptotic
behavior is correct only for exact integral relations (REF ) and
may be easily reproduced using (REF ) with FORMULA  from (REF ).
Let us recapitulate main conclusions. Braaten&Segel approximation provide
reasonable approximation, as nonlinear equations (REF ) and (REF )
are easily solved using e.g. bisection method. Zero and first-order approximations
(REF , REF , REF ) with limiting
values (REF ) provide starting
points and ranges. Approximation has been tested by {{cite:5423f528-0f8f-41a5-a883-80c57c0ab48f}}
and is considered as the best available {{cite:c61ee0b7-ea4d-4a08-be1d-9555ea57e170}}. Errors for part of the FORMULA -FORMULA 
plane where plasmaneutrino process is not dominant may be as large as 5% {{cite:5423f528-0f8f-41a5-a883-80c57c0ab48f}}.
At present, these inaccuracies are irrelevant for any practical
application, and Braaten&Segel approximation is recommended for all purposes.

Plasmon decay rate
In the Standard Model of electroweak interactions,
massive in-medium photons and longitudal plasmons
may decay into neutrino-antineutrino pairs:
FORMULA 
In the first-order calculations two Feynmann diagrams
(Fig. REF ) contribute to
decay rate {{cite:fc807455-1cd3-46c6-b814-8682ac43bd4a}}, {{cite:d4945d16-64a6-418f-a776-5cc6909a6ef8}}.
FIGURE 
For the decay of the longitudal plasmon squared matrix element is:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is four momentum
of the plasmon. FORMULA  and
FORMULA  is four-momentum of the neutrino
and antineutrino, respectively.
Squared matrix element for decay of the massive photon is:
FORMULA 

where FORMULA  is defined in (REF ) and axial polarization function FORMULA 
reads:
FORMULA 
Fermi constant is  FORMULA
{{cite:a875226b-d5b0-45c2-90af-36f494b14fe5}} and, in standard model of electroweak interactions, vector and
axial coupling constants are:
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
for electron and FORMULA  neutrinos, respectively.
The Weinberg angle is FORMULA  {{cite:a875226b-d5b0-45c2-90af-36f494b14fe5}}.
Terms containing FORMULA  (so-called axial contribution) in (REF ) are frequently
treated separately {{cite:d4945d16-64a6-418f-a776-5cc6909a6ef8}} or removed at all {{cite:b5ac19d9-7de2-42be-b6fa-83720552c308}}.
In calculations concentrated on the total emissivity this is justified
as anti-symmetric term multiplied by FORMULA  do not contribute at all and term
FORMULA  is suppressed relative to the term beginning with FORMULA 
by four orders of magnitude {{cite:b5ac19d9-7de2-42be-b6fa-83720552c308}}. However, if one attempts
to compute neutrino energy spectrum all three terms should be
added together, as mixed V-A ,,channel” alone leads to negative emission
probability for some neutrino energy range (Fig. REF ),
what is physically unacceptable.
These terms remains numerically small but only for
electron neutrinos. For FORMULA  and FORMULA  neutrino spectra axial
part contributes at FORMULA  1% level due to very small
value FORMULA  while still FORMULA . ”Mixed” term
leads to significant differences between FORMULA  and FORMULA 
spectra, cf. Fig. REF . Relative contributions
of the three transverse ”channels” for electron and FORMULA 
are presented in Table REF .
TABLE 
In general, all the terms in the
squared matrix element (REF ) should be added.
We have only two different spectra: longitudal and transverse one.

has been derived for the first time in {{cite:d4945d16-64a6-418f-a776-5cc6909a6ef8}}.
Here, we present result in the form valid for both types of plasmons, ready
for calculations using any available form of dispersion relation:

Product FORMULA  of the unit step functions FORMULA  in (REF ) restrict

FORMULA 
Residue factors FORMULA  are given in (REF ) and (REF ). Maximum
energy FORMULA  in (REF ) for longitudal plasmons must be in the
agreement with particular approximation used for FORMULA :
FORMULA , (REF ) or (REF )
for zero-order (REF ), first-order (REF ) or Braaten&Segel (REF )
approximation, respectively. For transverse plasmons FORMULA 
and last FORMULA  function in (REF ) has no effect and may be omitted.

Longitudal neutrino spectrum
Analytical approximation
We begin with general remark on the spectrum.
Note, that eq. (REF ) is symmetric for longitudal mode
under change FORMULA  because (REF )
is symmetric with respect to exchange FORMULA .
Resulting energy spectrum is thus identical for neutrinos and antineutrinos.
This is not true for transverse plasmons with axial
contribution included, cf. Sect. REF .
Using zero-order dispersion relation for longitudal plasmons
(REF ) we are able to express spectrum by the elementary functions.
Longitudal residue factor FORMULA  is now:
FORMULA 
and Jacobian FORMULA  resulting from the integration
of the Dirac delta function is:
FORMULA 
Now, differential rate FORMULA  (cf. (REF )
and footnote REF ) becomes much more simple
and integral over FORMULA  can be evaluated analytically.
Finally, we get the longitudal spectrum:
FORMULA 
where normalized spectrum is:
FORMULA 
Let us note that FORMULA  is undefined at FORMULA ; use limit instead:
FORMULA 
Function FORMULA  is symmetric with respect to point FORMULA , where FORMULA 
has a maximum value (Fig. REF , dotted line).
In this limit, correct for non-relativistic, non-degenerate plasma,
average neutrino and antineutrino energy is FORMULA 
and maximum FORMULA  energy is FORMULA .
Inspection of Fig. REF 
reveals little difference between analytical result (REF )
and result obtained with first-order relativistic corrections to the
dispersion relation (REF ).
FIGURE 

Numerical results
Simple formula (REF ) significantly underestimates flux and the
maximum neutrino energy, equal to FORMULA  rather than FORMULA .
Therefore we have used Braaten & Segel approximation for longitudal plasmon
dispersion relation.
To derive spectrum we will use form of differential rate (REF )
provided by {{cite:d4945d16-64a6-418f-a776-5cc6909a6ef8}}.
In the Braaten&Segel approximation:
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
Spectrum is computed as an integral of (REF )
over FORMULA .
Example result is presented in Fig. REF . Integration of
the function in Fig. REF  over neutrino
energy gives result in well agreement with both (30) from {{cite:fc807455-1cd3-46c6-b814-8682ac43bd4a}}
and (54) from {{cite:d4945d16-64a6-418f-a776-5cc6909a6ef8}}.

Transverse plasmon decay spectrum 
Analytical approximation
Derivation of massive in-medium photon decay spectrum closely follows
previous subsection. Semi-analytical formula can be derived for dispersion relations
(REF ).
For dispersion relation (REF )
transverse residue factor FORMULA  is:
FORMULA 
polarization function FORMULA  is equal to:
FORMULA 
and Jacobian resulting from integration
of the Dirac delta function FORMULA  is:
FORMULA 
FIGURE 
Approximate spectrum, neglecting differences between
neutrinos and antineutrinos, is given by the following integral:
FORMULA 
where rational function FORMULA  is:
FORMULA 
Result presented in Fig. REF  show
that spectrum (REF ) obtained with dispersion relation (REF )
agree well in both low and high neutrino energy part
with spectrum obtained from Braaten&Segel approximation for
dispersion relations. Dispersion relation (REF )
produces much larger error, and spectrum nowhere agree with correct
result. This fact is not a big surprise: as was pointed out by Braaten {{cite:dbf26b53-33f2-4a60-8a8c-5cad2bcb75d0}}
dispersion relation is crucial.
Therefore, all previous results, including seminal BPS work {{cite:05ce1a06-e3be-4ac2-87b7-f6a3009feb5e}},
could be easily improved just by the trivial replacement
FORMULA . Moreover, closely related photoneutrino
process also has been computed {{cite:05ce1a06-e3be-4ac2-87b7-f6a3009feb5e}}, {{cite:b5ac19d9-7de2-42be-b6fa-83720552c308}}, {{cite:7d0d22a4-f2bc-4856-ae9a-9cf5dca9fa7b}}, {{cite:f55624e0-4841-4d21-9d8b-c75482ea72f6}}
with simplified dispersion relation
(REF ) with FORMULA .
One exception is work of Esposito et. al. {{cite:049a1c5c-40a5-4960-9b7e-24351e0ec6ec}}. It remains unclear however,
which result is better, as accurate dispersion relations have never
been used within photoneutrino process context. For plasmaneutrino,
Eq. (REF ) is much better approximation than (REF ),
especially if one put FORMULA  from exact formula (REF ).
High energy tail of the spectrum also will be exact in this case.
As formula (REF ) agree perfectly with the tail
of the spectrum, we may use it to derive very useful analytical expression.
Leaving only leading terms of the rational function (REF )
FORMULA 
one is able to compute integral
(REF ) analytically:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA .
Interestingly, spectrum (REF ) is invariant
under transformation:
FORMULA 
and all results obtained for high energy tail of the spectrum
immediately may be transformed for low-energy approximation.
The asymptotic behavior of (REF ) for FORMULA 
is of main interest:
FORMULA 
where for electron neutrinos :
FORMULA 
and FORMULA , FORMULA  are in MeV. For FORMULA  neutrinos just
replace FORMULA  with FORMULA .
Formula (REF ) gives also quite reasonable estimates
of the total emissivity FORMULA  and mean neutrino energies FORMULA :
FORMULA 
FORMULA 

For a comparison, Braaten & Segel {{cite:fc807455-1cd3-46c6-b814-8682ac43bd4a}} derived exact formulae
in the high temperature limit FORMULA :

FORMULA 

Formulae above agree with FORMULA 25% error in the leading coefficients.

Numerical results

Summary
Main new results presented in the article are analytical formulae for neutrino spectra
(REF , REF ) and exact analytical formula (REF ) for the
high energy tail of the transverse spectrum. The latter is of main interest from
the detection of astrophysical sources point of view:
recently available detection techniques are unable to detect keV plasmaneutrinos
emitted with typical energies FORMULA 
(Fig. REF , REF ), where
FORMULA  is the plasma frequency (REF ).
Tail behavior of the transverse spectrum quickly ”decouple” from FORMULA  dominated
maximum area, and becomes dominated by temperature-dependent
term FORMULA . Calculation of the events
in the detector is then straightforward, as detector threshold
in the realistic experiment will be above maximum area. This approach
is much more reliable compared to the typical practice, where
an average neutrino energy is used as a parameter in an arbitrary
analytical formula.
Analytical formulae for the spectrum are shown to be a poor approximation
of the realistic situation, especially for longitudal plasmons (Fig. REF ).
This is in the agreement with general remarks on the dispersion relations
presented by Braaten {{cite:dbf26b53-33f2-4a60-8a8c-5cad2bcb75d0}}. On the contrary,
Braaten & Segel {{cite:fc807455-1cd3-46c6-b814-8682ac43bd4a}}
approximation is shown to be a very good approach not only for the total emissivities,
but also for the spectrum. Exception is the tail of the massive
photon decay neutrino spectrum: Braaten & Segel {{cite:fc807455-1cd3-46c6-b814-8682ac43bd4a}} formulae lead to
underestimate of the thermal photon mass while the formula (REF )
gives exact result. Numerical difference between FORMULA  from (REF ) and (REF )
is however small {{cite:fc807455-1cd3-46c6-b814-8682ac43bd4a}}. Calculating of the emissivities
by the spectrum integration seems much longer route compared to typical
methods, but we are given much more insight into process details.
For example, we obtain exact formula for the tail for free this way.
Interesting surprise revealed in the course of our calculations is importance
of the high-momentum behavior of the massive photon. While mathematically
identical to simplest approach used in the early calculations, formula (REF )
gives much better approximation for the total emissivity than (REF ).
