An upper bound on the amplitude of the primordial gravitational wave spectrum
generated during ultra-violet DBI inflation is derived.
The bound is insensitive to the form of the inflaton
potential and the warp factor of the compactified
dimensions and can be expressed entirely in terms of
observational parameters once the volume of the five-dimensional
sub-manifold of the throat has been specified. For standard type IIB
compactification schemes, the bound predicts
undetectably small tensor perturbations
with a tensor-scalar ratio FORMULA .
This is incompatible with a corresponding lower limit of
FORMULA , which applies to any model
that generates a red spectral index FORMULA  and a potentially
detectable non-Gaussianity in the curvature perturbation.
Possible ways of evading these bounds in more
general DBI-type scenarios are discussed and a
multiple-brane model is investigated as a specific example.

Introduction
The inflationary scenario provides the
theoretical framework for the early history
of the universe. It has now been successfully tested by observations,
including the third year data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy
Probe (WMAP3) {{cite:0cfb3f6f-28a4-4499-9a64-918ebfc7cc2d}}. Despite this success, however, the high energy
physics that resulted in a phase of accelerated expansion is still
not well understood. String/M-theory unifies the fundamental interactions
including gravity and it is natural and important to
develop inflationary models within string theory and to confront them with
cosmological observations.
One class of string-theoretic models that has received
considerable attention is D-brane inflation
{{cite:b7c95d32-d645-45fb-8ed9-ccb8f5e55f00}}, {{cite:d9b050c6-ede9-44c9-9632-0186c1530e24}}, {{cite:6f696862-b08b-4f2a-b554-80abad089a28}}, {{cite:e6edd85c-69b1-4d8b-a7b0-12a61c7ba6a0}}, {{cite:faa3bf91-4440-4903-8b4c-2ed5d0a04341}}, {{cite:28cf68bf-42bc-449a-863e-975934919ed8}}, {{cite:5b316daa-24c0-41f9-b75f-5f9883a84573}}, {{cite:13e635ff-4016-43d2-9f20-6db421b48bf9}}, {{cite:ffdbc448-99f6-455c-916a-2417759c1acb}}, {{cite:c85df112-9d57-4c3e-90dc-5e7c48ff2593}}, {{cite:fe0dc8ba-a971-421f-a839-d0db5a33ec15}}, {{cite:fa86bbde-a710-41a4-9a1d-7bcae07d67e4}}, {{cite:82ea40c0-b9f2-4e4a-b981-23fc597ae764}}, {{cite:2093d613-5c35-4c08-9ed7-19b3f4ab6017}}, {{cite:bba76906-0685-4a81-b406-a999a9ca3c14}}, {{cite:963ca153-0793-49e8-a418-044af30864ff}}, {{cite:ce5c75f3-2450-487a-b58b-1403bb5d2c23}}, {{cite:ce039f98-4ebb-4e8a-80c6-c041b0d4aaad}}, {{cite:3d770aa6-d100-4c76-aa85-9c2180f3e726}}, {{cite:8cfea061-6fab-471b-84c7-2624c42df8d3}}, {{cite:f5092620-c93e-4a21-a260-e51ef0547eac}}, {{cite:a452e179-e26b-4efe-a33f-40a5bd59d209}}, {{cite:1411dfa5-0f28-471d-af43-30063d554f73}}, {{cite:8127f301-1546-4829-80ca-cedb0d215326}}, {{cite:8178ccb7-ed13-4ce2-b7dc-6be9a0d7bcbd}}.
(For recent reviews, see, e.g., {{cite:bb06bb65-58a7-436c-a88d-fc969cdd3948}}, {{cite:7054adfa-9817-4611-a4cf-5f9d25d3a39f}}).
Of particular interest
is the DBI inflationary scenario {{cite:28cf68bf-42bc-449a-863e-975934919ed8}}, {{cite:fe0dc8ba-a971-421f-a839-d0db5a33ec15}}.
This is based on the compactification of type IIB string theory on a
Calabi-Yau (CY) three-fold, where the form-field fluxes generate locally
warped regions known as `throats'. The propagation of a
FORMULA -brane in such a region can drive inflation, where the inflaton
field is identified with the radial position of the brane
along the throat. Since this is an open string mode, the field
equation for the inflaton is determined by a Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action.
The purpose of the present work is to
explore the observational consequences of DBI inflation.
In general, primordial gravitational wave fluctuations
and non-Gaussian statistics in the curvature perturbation provide
two powerful discriminants of inflationary scenarios.
The nature of the DBI action is such that the sound
speed of fluctuations in the inflaton can be much less than the speed of
light. This induces a large and potentially detectable non-Gaussian
signal in the density perturbations {{cite:28cf68bf-42bc-449a-863e-975934919ed8}}, {{cite:fe0dc8ba-a971-421f-a839-d0db5a33ec15}}, {{cite:d9b258a1-e3ac-4a94-ae5e-301afb15003f}}, {{cite:9774e647-efe9-4366-9023-d3aa741dddec}}.
The gravitational wave background generated in DBI
inflation was recently investigated by Baumann and McAllister (BM)
{{cite:766483d1-0907-4091-a402-22f31b5ca409}}. By exploiting a relationship due originally
to Lyth {{cite:c54af3e6-24bf-49b1-bfcd-9d166ed7b45e}}, these authors derived a field-theoretic upper limit
to the tensor amplitude and concluded that
rather stringent conditions would need to be satisfied for these
perturbations to be detectable.
Moreover, the special case of
DBI inflation driven by a quadratic potential is incompatible with the WMAP3
data when this constraint is imposed {{cite:b203b444-e93f-490d-a019-a1a9097ab66b}}.
Our aim is to derive observational constraints on DBI inflation that are
insensitive to the details of the throat geometry and the inflaton potential.
In general, there are two realizations of the scenario,
which are referred to as the ultra-violet (UV) and infra-red (IR)
versions, respectively. These are characterized by whether the brane is
moving towards or away from the tip of the throat.
We focus initially on the UV scenario
and derive an upper bound on
the gravitational wave amplitude in terms of observable
parameters. This limit arises by considering
the variation of the inflaton field during the era when
observable scales cross the Hubble radius, and
we find in general that the tensor-scalar ratio must satisfy
FORMULA . This
is below the projected sensitivity of future Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization
experiments {{cite:50bb9aa0-b251-45f5-b944-cdf77a659c8f}}, {{cite:87fcec09-6102-4dac-9ffd-0b7d31dd020b}}. On the other hand, the WMAP3 data
favours a red perturbation spectrum with
FORMULA  when the tensor modes are negligible and
the scalar spectral index is effectively constant {{cite:0cfb3f6f-28a4-4499-9a64-918ebfc7cc2d}}.
For models which generate such a spectrum,
we identify a corresponding lower limit on the
tensor modes such that FORMULA .
This is incompatible with the upper bound
on FORMULA  when FORMULA , as inferred
by the observations.
Hence, a reconciliation between theory and observation
requires either a relaxation of the upper limit on FORMULA  or a blue
spectral index FORMULA . The DBI scenario would need
to be generalized in a suitable way for the upper bound on FORMULA 
to be weakened. We identify necessary conditions that a
generalized action must satisfy for the Baumann-McAllister
constraint to be relaxed.
We then show that such conditions can be realized in a recently
proposed IR version of DBI inflation driven
by multiple coincident branes {{cite:d9a5b807-ce7b-4d22-a89f-ecc1ba60cb84}}.
The paper is organized as follows. We briefly review DBI inflation
in Section . In Sections  and
, we derive the respective
limits on the amplitude of the tensor perturbations.
We determine how the BM bound may be relaxed in generalized DBI models in
Section  and discuss multi-brane
IR scenarios in Section . Finally, we conclude
in Section .
Units are chosen such that FORMULA 
defines the reduced Planck mass and FORMULA .

DBI inflation
Flux compactification of type IIB string theory to four dimensions
results in a warped geometry, where the six-dimensional CY
manifold contains one or more throats (see {{cite:948091b0-8ea6-43dd-b967-08ca78900e06}}, {{cite:86131c5c-b467-44ae-a977-da439418f123}} for reviews).
The metric inside a throat has the generic form
FORMULA 
where the warp factor FORMULA  is a function of the
radial coordinate FORMULA  along the throat and FORMULA 
is a Sasaki-Einstein five-manifold.
In many cases, the ten-dimensional metric (REF ) can be
approximated locally by the geometry FORMULA , where the
warp factor is given by FORMULA  and
the radius of curvature of the FORMULA  space is defined by
FORMULA 
such that FORMULA  is the dimensionless volume of
FORMULA  with unit radius, FORMULA  is the FORMULA  charge of the throat,
FORMULA  is the string coupling and FORMULA  is the string mass scale.
In the Klebanov-Strassler (KS) background {{cite:64181820-ea48-404b-802e-82dfb8e2ba00}}, the throat
is a warped deformed conifold and
corresponds to a cone over the manifold
FORMULA 
in the UV limit (FORMULA ). This has
a volume FORMULA  and topology
FORMULA , where the FORMULA  is fibred over the FORMULA .
The conical singularity at the tip of the throat
is smoothed out by an
FORMULA  `cap' due to the wrapping of the fluxes along the cycles of the conifold
{{cite:64181820-ea48-404b-802e-82dfb8e2ba00}}, {{cite:ebd32827-342b-4dab-858f-a41f911b8a4d}} and the warp factor asymptotes to
a constant value in this region.
In general, the low-energy world-volume dynamics
of a probe FORMULA -brane in a warped throat is determined
by an effective, four-dimensional DBI action.
The inflaton field is related to the radial
position of the brane by
FORMULA , where FORMULA 
is the brane tension. The action is then given by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the Ricci curvature scalar,
FORMULA 
is the kinetic energy of the inflaton, FORMULA  denotes
the field's interaction
potential and FORMULA 
defines the warped brane tension. We refer to FORMULA  as the
`kinetic function' for the inflaton.
We consider a spatially flat and isotropic cosmology
sourced by a homogeneous scalar field.
In this case, the Friedmann equations for a monotonically
varying inflaton can be expressed in the form {{cite:28cf68bf-42bc-449a-863e-975934919ed8}}
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  represents the Hubble parameter
as a function of the field and a prime denotes FORMULA .
An important consequence of the non-trivial kinetic structure
of the DBI action is that the sound speed of fluctuations in the inflaton
differs from unity:
FORMULA 
where a subscripted comma denotes partial differentiation.
Furthermore, the condition that the sound speed be real
imposes an upper bound on the kinetic energy
of the inflaton, FORMULA , which
is independent of the steepness of the potential.
The motion of the brane is said to be `relativistic' when this bound is
close to saturation.
We now define the epoch that is directly
accessible to cosmological observations as `observable inflation'.
Depending on the reheating
temperature, this occurred some 30 to 60 e-foldings before the end of
inflation. The inflationary dynamics during this phase can
be quantified in terms of three parameters:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .
We will assume that the `slow-roll' conditions
FORMULA  applied during observable inflation.
In this regime, the amplitudes and spectral indices of the two-point functions
for the scalar and tensor perturbations are given by {{cite:15caa0cd-d6a7-4ffb-8b1e-bc2afdf3e161}}
FORMULA 
respectively, where the quantities on the right-hand sides are evaluated
when the scale with comoving wavenumber FORMULA  crossed
the Hubble radius during inflation.
The tensor-scalar ratio, FORMULA , is directly related to
the tensor spectral index by {{cite:15caa0cd-d6a7-4ffb-8b1e-bc2afdf3e161}}
FORMULA 
Hence, a sound speed different to unity leads to a violation of the
standard inflationary consistency equation, which might be
detectable in the foreseeable future {{cite:a1c17106-fd7c-4097-91b3-cf7d5e947875}}, {{cite:0050b886-fef1-4f0b-98bf-3fae2aa4c845}}.
Recent observations of the CMB
indicate that FORMULA  and FORMULA  {{cite:0cfb3f6f-28a4-4499-9a64-918ebfc7cc2d}}.
The best-fit value for a constant spectral index is
FORMULA  if FORMULA  is assumed as a prior.
This is strengthened to
FORMULA  for a prior of FORMULA  {{cite:0cfb3f6f-28a4-4499-9a64-918ebfc7cc2d}}.
A further important consequence of a small sound speed is that departures
from purely Gaussian statistics may be large
{{cite:28cf68bf-42bc-449a-863e-975934919ed8}}, {{cite:fe0dc8ba-a971-421f-a839-d0db5a33ec15}}, {{cite:d9b258a1-e3ac-4a94-ae5e-301afb15003f}}, {{cite:9774e647-efe9-4366-9023-d3aa741dddec}}. It is conventional
to quantify such deviations by expressing the non-Gaussian curvature
perturbation FORMULA  in the form
FORMULA , where
FORMULA  represents the Gaussian contribution,
the quadratic piece is a convolution and FORMULA  defines
the `non-linearity' parameter {{cite:b228211c-3d70-42e0-9140-f8e30cf8703e}}.
In general, this parameter is a function of the three momenta which
form a triangle in Fourier space. However, in the limit where
these momenta have equal magnitude, the non-linearity parameter
is given to leading-order by {{cite:9774e647-efe9-4366-9023-d3aa741dddec}}, {{cite:0050b886-fef1-4f0b-98bf-3fae2aa4c845}}
FORMULA 
Currently, WMAP3 constrains this parameter
to be FORMULA  {{cite:0cfb3f6f-28a4-4499-9a64-918ebfc7cc2d}}, {{cite:7a390ecf-ec0b-47d1-bf10-9831e973cc46}}.
Finally, Eqs. (REF ), (REF ) and (REF )
may be combined to constrain the warped brane tension
during observable inflation:
FORMULA 
where a subscript `FORMULA ' denotes that the quantity is to be evaluated
at that epoch.
In the following, we first consider the UV version of DBI inflation,
where the brane moves relativistically
towards the tip of the throat. We will assume implicitly
that the sound speed is sufficiently small to generate a non-Gaussianity in
excess of FORMULA , since this is the projected
sensitivity of the Planck satellite {{cite:01499e63-2d7d-4fa9-9ddd-605bcc15d441}}. Furthermore, we consider
an arbitrary warp factor and inflaton potential,
subject only to the condition that a sufficiently long phase of
quasi-exponential expansion can be maintained to solve the horizon problem of
the hot big bang model.

An Upper Bound on the Primordial Gravitational Waves
Recently, Baumann and McAllister (BM) {{cite:766483d1-0907-4091-a402-22f31b5ca409}}
derived a field-theoretic upper bound on the tensor-scalar ratio
by noting that the four-dimensional Planck mass is related
to the volume of the compactified CY manifold, FORMULA , such that
FORMULA , where FORMULA . In general, the compactified volume
is comprised of bulk and throat contributions,
FORMULA , where the latter is
given by
FORMULA 
and FORMULA  denotes the radial coordinate at
the edge of the throat (defined as the region
where FORMULA  is of order unity).
If one assumes that the bulk volume is
non-negligible relative to
that of the throat (i.e. FORMULA ),
it follows that FORMULA .
For a warped FORMULA  geometry, this leads to an
upper limit on the total variation of the inflaton field in
the throat region:
FORMULA 
Condition (REF ) may be converted into a
corresponding limit on the tensor-scalar ratio by noting from
the definition (REF )
that FORMULA .
This implies that the variation of the inflaton field
is given by the Lyth bound
{{cite:c54af3e6-24bf-49b1-bfcd-9d166ed7b45e}}, {{cite:766483d1-0907-4091-a402-22f31b5ca409}}
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .
Since FORMULA , this
results in an upper bound on the observable tensor-scalar ratio
{{cite:766483d1-0907-4091-a402-22f31b5ca409}}:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA 
is a model-dependent parameter that quantifies
how FORMULA  varies during the final stages of inflation.
Typically, one expects FORMULA ,
although smaller values may be possible if the slow-roll conditions are
violated after observable scales have crossed the horizon.
Furthermore, FORMULA  is necessary
for backreaction effects to be negligible. Hence, the
constraint (REF )
imposes a strong restriction on DBI inflationary models.
On the other hand, the numerical value
of FORMULA  is uncertain.
Our aim here is to focus on the range of values covered by the
inflaton field during the observable stages of inflation.
This will result in a constraint on the tensor modes that
can be expressed in terms of observable parameters.
To proceed, we denote the change in the value of the inflaton field over
observable scales by
FORMULA .
Since the brane moves towards the tip of the throat in
UV DBI inflation, it follows that FORMULA , which
implies that
FORMULA 
This change in the inflaton value will correspond
to a fraction of the throat volume,
FORMULA ,
where equality in the second limit arises if
the bulk volume is negligible. Hence,
FORMULA  is bounded such that
FORMULA 
The observations of the CMB
that directly constrain the primordial tensor perturbations only
cover multipole values in the range FORMULA .
This is equivalent to no more than FORMULA 
e-foldings of inflationary expansion and, in general,
corresponds to a narrow range of inflaton values.
To a first approximation, therefore, the fraction of the throat volume
(REF ) that is accessible to cosmological
observation can be estimated to be
FORMULA 
Combining the inequality (REF ) with Eq. (REF )
then implies that
FORMULA 
and substituting the CMB normalization (REF ) and
condition (REF ) into the bound (REF )
yields the upper limit
FORMULA 
Hence, employing the Lyth bound in the form FORMULA 
results in a very general upper limit on the tensor-scalar ratio:
FORMULA 
Condition (REF ) is
only weakly dependent on the level of non-Gaussianity
when FORMULA  and we may therefore neglect the
factor involving this parameter. Substituting the WMAP3 normalization
FORMULA  then implies that
FORMULA 
Furthermore, the most optimistic
estimate for the minimum number of e-foldings that could be
probed by observation is FORMULA , whereas
a generic compactification arises when
the volume of the Einstein five-manifold is FORMULA  {{cite:64181820-ea48-404b-802e-82dfb8e2ba00}}. This yields a model-independent
upper bound on the tensor-scalar ratio for standard UV DBI inflation:
FORMULA 
This is significantly below the sensitivity
of future CMB polarization experiments, which will measure
FORMULA  {{cite:50bb9aa0-b251-45f5-b944-cdf77a659c8f}}, {{cite:87fcec09-6102-4dac-9ffd-0b7d31dd020b}}. If CMB
observations are able to span the full range of e-foldings such that
FORMULA , this constraint is strengthened to
FORMULA .
Before concluding this section, we should remark that
the estimate (REF ) was derived under the assumption
that the integrand in Eq. (REF )
is constant. This inevitably introduces errors into the bound
(REF ). However, the two limiting cases of interest
in KS-type geometries arise
when the warp factor scales either as FORMULA 
or as FORMULA  {{cite:64181820-ea48-404b-802e-82dfb8e2ba00}}, {{cite:ebd32827-342b-4dab-858f-a41f911b8a4d}}. In both cases
the integral (REF ) can be performed analytically.
Indeed, if we specify FORMULA  for some constant FORMULA ,
evaluate the integral between FORMULA 
to FORMULA , and expand to second-order in a
Taylor series, we find that
FORMULA 
This implies that the error in Eq. (REF )
is no greater than
about FORMULA  if
FORMULA . More generally, it follows that a similar
error will arise for any warp factor
FORMULA , where the function
FORMULA  satisfies FORMULA 
over observable scales.
We conclude, therefore, that Eq. (REF )
provides a sufficiently good estimate of the volume element
for a generic warp factorAs we shall see in the following Section,
even an order of magnitude error will make little
difference to our final conclusions..

A Lower Bound on the Primordial Gravitational Waves
The analysis of the previous Section
indicates that standard versions of UV DBI inflation generate a
tensor spectrum that is unobservably
small. Hence, FORMULA  can be assumed as a prior
when discussing the WMAP3 data. However, in this case the data
excludes a scale-invariant density spectrum at the FORMULA  level
when the running in the spectral index, FORMULA ,
is negligible {{cite:0cfb3f6f-28a4-4499-9a64-918ebfc7cc2d}}.
Furthermore, a blue spectral index
is only marginally consistent with the data when FORMULA  and FORMULA .
(The inferred upper limit is FORMULA ).
Although the results from WMAP3 do allow for a blue spectrum if there is
significant negative running in the spectral index, we will
focus in this Section
on models that generate a red spectral index FORMULA , since these seem
to be preferred by the current data.
In general, the spectral index may be related to the tensor-scalar ratio.
After differentiating Eq. (REF )
with respect to cosmic time, and employing Eqs. ()
and (), we find that
FORMULA 
where the minus (plus) sign corresponds to
a brane moving down (up) the warped throat.
The second term in Eq. (REF )
can be converted into observable parameters
by defining the `tilt' of the non-linearity parameter,
FORMULA  {{cite:2093d613-5c35-4c08-9ed7-19b3f4ab6017}}.
This implies that FORMULA  and
substitution of Eqs. ()–(REF )
into Eq. (REF ) then yields
FORMULA 
In {{cite:0050b886-fef1-4f0b-98bf-3fae2aa4c845}}, brane inflation near the tip of a KS-type
throat was considered, where the warped brane tension asymptotes to a
constant value. In this regime, Eq. (REF ) reduces to
the condition FORMULA  when FORMULA  is
sufficiently large to be detectable by Planck,
i.e., FORMULA . It then follows from the
WMAP3 best-fit value FORMULA  and upper limit
FORMULA  {{cite:7a390ecf-ec0b-47d1-bf10-9831e973cc46}} that the gravitational wave amplitude
is bounded both from above and below such that FORMULA . These bounds follow from
current WMAP3 limits on the spectral index and the
non-linearity parameter, but do not take into account the
field-theoretic upper bound that must be imposed
on the variation of the inflaton field during inflation.
More generally, in UV DBI inflation where the brane moves towards the
tip of the throat, it is reasonable to assume
that the warp factor decreases monotonically
with the radial coordinate over the observable range of inflaton values,
i.e., that FORMULA . This condition is satisfied for
FORMULA  compactifications and KS-type solutions.
Consequently, the third term in
Eq. (REF ) will be semi-negative definite,
which implies that
FORMULA 
Condition (REF ) is a consistency relation on UV DBI
inflation in terms of observable parameters and it
may be combined with the upper bound
(REF ) to confront the scenario with observations.
Firstly, let us assume that the tensor-scalar ratio is negligible.
The WMAP3 data implies that FORMULA , and this is only
compatible with condition (REF ) if
FORMULA 
However, when FORMULA , this would violate the slow-roll conditions
that must be satisfied for a consistent
derivation of the perturbation spectra
(REF ). For example, the conservative
bound FORMULA  with FORMULA  is violated if
FORMULA .
In view of this, let us consider the case where the tensor
perturbations are non-negligible.
The magnitude of the second term in condition (REF )
is suppressed by a factor of FORMULA 
relative to the first. This is expected to
be a significant effect in DBI inflation. Consequently,
by saturating the WMAP3 limit FORMULA  {{cite:7a390ecf-ec0b-47d1-bf10-9831e973cc46}}, we arrive at
a lower bound on the tensor-scalar ratio which applies
to any model for which the ratio FORMULA  is
negligible:
FORMULA 
This requires FORMULA  for the WMAP3 best-fit value
FORMULA , which is incompatible with the upper limit
(REF ).
In general, therefore, it is difficult to simultaneously satisfy
the bounds on FORMULA  with the WMAP3 data
in standard UV DBI inflation. There is a
small observational window where a blue spectrum is consistent
with the data, in which case the lower limit
(REF ) does not apply.
However, if the tensor modes are negligible,
as implied by the inequality (REF ), the
data strongly favours a red spectral index with FORMULA ,
and this violates the condition (REF ). A significant
detection of a red spectral index requires either a
violation of the slow-roll conditions or a sufficiently
small value for the volume of FORMULA .
In particular, combining the limits
(REF ) and (REF ) results in the condition
FORMULA 
and we find that FORMULA 
for typical values FORMULA  and
FORMULA . This
is comparable to the limit on the volume derived for the special case of a
quadratic inflaton potential {{cite:766483d1-0907-4091-a402-22f31b5ca409}}.
As noted in {{cite:766483d1-0907-4091-a402-22f31b5ca409}}, {{cite:b203b444-e93f-490d-a019-a1a9097ab66b}}, condition
(REF ) may be achieved
if FORMULA  corresponds to a FORMULA  space,
which has arbitrarily small volume in the limit
FORMULA  and FORMULA  {{cite:0083bf10-71d3-4268-b2c4-0a027fd8057b}}.
Small volumes could also be realized
by orbifolding the FORMULA  symmetry of a KS-type throat.
On the other hand,
our upper limit (REF ) on the gravitational waves
follows as a consequence of assuming
the constraint (REF ). This
could be violated in IR versions of the scenario, where
observable scales crossed the Hubble radius when the
brane was near the tip of the throat and FORMULA 
{{cite:fa86bbde-a710-41a4-9a1d-7bcae07d67e4}}, {{cite:2093d613-5c35-4c08-9ed7-19b3f4ab6017}}.
Nonetheless, we emphasize that the upper bound (REF )
on the tensor modes
will also apply to any IR DBI model for which
FORMULA .
In view of the above discussion, therefore,
we will proceed in the following Section
to discuss a framework for generalizing the DBI scenario so
that the constraints on the tensor modes can be satisfied.

Relaxing the Baumann-McAllister Bound
In this Section, we take a phenomenological
approach and consider a general kinetic function of the form:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  are unspecified functions of the inflaton
fieldIt is assumed
implicitly that the functions have a suitable form for
generating a successful phase of inflation..
A direct comparison with Eq. ()
indicates that the standard DBI action exhibits two important properties.
The first is the condition that FORMULA . This implies that
FORMULA  and greatly simplifies the form of Eq. (REF ).
The second property is that the warp factor uniquely determines
the kinetic structure of the action, i.e., FORMULA .
In view of this, it is interesting to consider whether
the gravitational wave constraints could be weakened by relaxing one
or both of these conditions.
Eq. (REF )
can be transformed into a similar form to that of
Eq. () through the field redefinition
FORMULA 
This implies that the sound speed of fluctuations in
the inflaton is given by
FORMULA 
and the scalar perturbation amplitude by
FORMULA 
However, the consistency equation (REF ) and
non-Gaussianity constraint (REF ) remain unaltered
for this more general class
of models {{cite:0050b886-fef1-4f0b-98bf-3fae2aa4c845}}. It
follows, therefore,
that the CMB normalization condition (REF )
generalizes to a constraint on the value of FORMULA :
FORMULA 
Finally, the expression for the scalar spectral index
follows most directly by generalizing Eq. (REF )
via the correspondence (REF ). It
is straightforward to show that
FORMULA 
Eq. (REF ) also allows us to deduce
that the infinitesimal variation of the effective
field FORMULA  is given by the Lyth bound,
FORMULA . This implies that
the variation of the inflaton field during inflation is
FORMULA 
If we now restrict our attention to
the observable stage of inflation, and further assume that the variation
of FORMULA  is negligible during that epoch, we find that
FORMULA 
On the other hand, the BM bound restricts the maximal
variation of the scalar field FORMULA  in the throat region.
This will be determined by expression (REF )
for generic warped geometries that are asymptotically
FORMULA  away from the tip of the throat. Moreover,
if observable scales leave the horizon
while the brane is inside the throat, the change in the field value
must satisfy FORMULA . Hence, it follows from
Eq. (REF ) thatWe are
being conservative by restricting our discussion to the
observable phase of inflation. More generally, if
FORMULA  remains nearly constant over the last FORMULA 
e-foldings of inflation,
we may substitute FORMULA , where FORMULA 
may be as large as 60. Thus, the generalized bound
(REF ) should be regarded as a necessary
(but not sufficient) condition to be satisfied by the tensor modes.
FORMULA 
We will refer to condition
(REF ) as the
generalized BM bound.
Combining expressions (REF ) and (REF ) then
results in a necessary condition on the value of FORMULA 
for the generalized BM bound to be satisfied:
FORMULA 
This condition can also be interpreted as a lower limit on FORMULA 
for a given value of FORMULA .
In UV models, identical arguments that led to
the lower limit (REF ) on the tensor-scalar ratio
will also apply in this more general context if, as expected, FORMULA 
is a monotonically increasing function. A necessary condition for
the lower and upper limits
(REF ) and (REF ) to be compatible, therefore, is
that
FORMULA 
In IR scenarios, however, the positive sign will apply in the
last term of the right-hand side of Eq. (REF ).
Hence, assuming FORMULA  and neglecting the term proportional to
FORMULA  yields an upper limit on the tensor-scalar ratio:
FORMULA 
Combining conditions (REF ) and (REF )
therefore leads to a constraint on FORMULA 
for the generalized BM bound to be satisfied in IR inflation:
FORMULA 
To summarize this Section,
expression (REF ) implies that the
BM bound (REF )
could be relaxed if FORMULA  on observable scales.
It is therefore important to develop string-inspired models
where this condition arises naturally. This will be the focus of the
next Section.

IR Inflation and Multiple Branes
Recently, an interesting version of IR DBI inflation
was proposed by Thomas and Ward {{cite:d9a5b807-ce7b-4d22-a89f-ecc1ba60cb84}}. In this model, the flux annihilation process
generates FORMULA  coincident branes that are initially located at the
bottom of a throat region. The dynamics of this configuration
is determined by the non-Abelian world-volume theory {{cite:c89a771d-a196-46f6-b0de-cd2ace775058}}, {{cite:cdb8d726-b322-4b20-951d-8ac4bd42448c}}.
This theory exhibits extra stringy degrees of freedom which arise due to the
fuzzy nature of the geometry. For the case where a fuzzy two-sphere is
embedded in a three-cycle in the FORMULA  manifold,
the kinetic structure of the action is given in the large FORMULA  limit by
{{cite:d9a5b807-ce7b-4d22-a89f-ecc1ba60cb84}}
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
defines the so-called `fuzzy' potential,
FORMULA  is a model-dependent constant and
FORMULA 
is the quadratic Casimir of the FORMULA -dimensional representation of
FORMULA .
Comparison with Eq. (REF )
implies that FORMULA  and FORMULA . Hence,
the new features of this model relative to the standard single-brane
scenario are parametrized in terms of the fuzzy potential FORMULA .
This configuration is conjectured to be dual to
a FORMULA -brane which is wrapped around a two-cycle
of the throat {{cite:93263d8f-f6b1-4ca4-bbbf-d4e3baa215a4}}, {{cite:5e24ec43-2a1b-4662-a46b-c36bbb1346aa}}, {{cite:56b2b618-c6b4-408a-899b-24d6d882fa09}}.
The regime FORMULA  is of interest for
relaxing the gravitational wave constraintsNote that
the case FORMULA  and
FORMULA  will not significantly relax the BM bound,
since we require FORMULA  for backreaction effects to be negligible..
The generalized BM bound (REF ) may now be expressed as
a limit on the value of the warp factor FORMULA  on CMB scales:
FORMULA 
We now consider whether this limit can be satisfied for reasonable choices
of parameters when the warped compactification corresponds to
an FORMULA  or KS throat, respectively. Recall that the warp
factor for the FORMULA  throat is given by FORMULA .
Condition (REF ) therefore reduces to a constraint on the
value of the inflation during observable inflation:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .
However, non-perturbative string effects are expected to become
important below a cutoff scale, FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the value of the
warp factor at that scale. For consistency, therefore, one requires
FORMULA , which implies an upper limit on the
FORMULA -brane charge:
FORMULA 
Assuming the typical values FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and
FORMULA  implies
FORMULA , where
the latter inequality follows for FORMULA  and FORMULA .
For an FORMULA  throat, the fuzzy potential
is a constant and the condition that FORMULA  becomes
FORMULA 
Hence, combining inequalities
(REF ) and (REF ) implies that
FORMULA 
and specifying FORMULA  and
FORMULA  then yields the limit
FORMULA , or equivalently,
FORMULA . Furthermore, since FORMULA ,
the inequality (REF ) may be strengthened by a
factor of FORMULA  by
substituting
FORMULA . This ratio
could be as
high as FORMULA , which would rule out this particular
model.
Since the branes are initially located at the tip of the
throat, another case of interest is the IR limit of the KS geometry, where
the warp factor asymptotes to a constant value
{{cite:48ff9fd2-d02e-43e1-9c8c-84df5b393743}}:
FORMULA 
and FORMULA  are the units of flux associated
with the NS-NS and R-R three-forms, respectively, such that FORMULA .
In this case, the generalized BM bound (REF ) becomes
FORMULA 
The radius of the three-sphere at the tip of the KS
throat is of the order FORMULA  in string units
and this must be large (and at the very least should exceed
unity) for the supergravity approximation to be reliable.
Substituting this requirement into expression (REF )
results in a necessary (but not sufficient) condition
on the FORMULA -brane charge for the
generalized BM bound to be satisfied:
FORMULA 
Recalling that a necessary condition for the backreaction
of the branes to be negligible is
FORMULA  implies that the
exponential term in (REF ) will dominate unless
the string coupling constant is extremely small. Hence, for
the parameter estimations quoted above, we
deduce the lower limit
FORMULA 
which becomes FORMULA  for FORMULA  and FORMULA .
In general, however, the FORMULA  and FORMULA  units of flux are not independent.
F-theory compactification on Calabi-Yau four-folds
provides a geometric way of parameterizing
type IIB string compactifications
{{cite:c15c6362-d437-4222-b675-9a0809be22ea}}, {{cite:bc84e192-0995-4fa7-aeea-5364cf9441d6}}, {{cite:fe12cc03-a12d-4867-8cce-defacc6836e7}}, {{cite:bf38b437-592f-46b2-89a3-0a68d883745e}}, {{cite:48ff9fd2-d02e-43e1-9c8c-84df5b393743}}, {{cite:1d053cbf-9a8d-4dba-99c2-635960dfc66b}}.
Global tadpole cancellation constrains the topology of the four-fold
and this restricts the brane and flux configurations.
When the KS system is embedded into F-theory, the
constraint is given by {{cite:48ff9fd2-d02e-43e1-9c8c-84df5b393743}}
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the Euler characteristic of the four-fold.
Hence, FORMULA  and together with condition
(REF ), this implies that
FORMULA 
for FORMULA .
It is known that the Euler number for four-folds
corresponding to hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces
can be as high as FORMULA  {{cite:1d053cbf-9a8d-4dba-99c2-635960dfc66b}},
so there are many compactifications that could
in principle satisfy the generalized BM bound.
On the other hand, the above limit on the Euler characteristic
does allow us to gain some insight into the
topology of the extra dimensions, since compactifications
which result in a small Euler characteristic would be
incompatible with the generalized BM bound.

Conclusion
In this paper, we have derived an upper limit to
the amplitude of the primordial gravitational wave spectrum
generated during UV DBI inflation. We considered
the maximal inflaton field variation
that can occur during the observable stages of inflation and assumed
only that the brane was inside the throat during that epoch.
The bound (REF ) is valid for an arbitrary inflaton potential and
warp factor (modulo some weak caveats) and can be expressed
entirely in terms of observable parameters once the volume of
the five-dimensional sub-manifold of the throat has been specified.
The inferred upper limit on FORMULA  is surprisingly strong.
We find that the standard UV
scenario predicts tensor perturbations that are undetectably small,
at a level FORMULA .
The current WMAP3 data
favours models that generate a red spectral index FORMULA 
when both the gravitational waves and running in the scalar
spectral index are negligible. For UV versions of the scenario,
we have identified a corresponding
lower limit on FORMULA  which applies in this region of
parameter space, FORMULA . It is clear that
the standard model
can not satisfy both the upper and lower bounds
on the tensor modes for the observationally favoured value
FORMULA .
The generality of our
analysis implies that modifying either the inflaton potential
or the form of the warp factor is unlikely to resolve this discrepancy.
On the other hand, there are a number of possible ways of reconciling
theory with observation. In general,
either the upper or lower limit on FORMULA  needs to be relaxed.
Weakening the latter would require a violation of the slow-roll
conditions or a blue spectral index.
A value of FORMULA  is compatible with WMAP3 if the running of the
spectral index
is sufficiently negative, but is only marginally
consistent if just the tensor modes are non-negligible. The
upper limit on FORMULA  can be weakened by reducing
the volume of FORMULA  or
by generalizing the DBI action. Furthermore, it need not necessarily
apply in IR versions of the scenario, although the BM bound will still hold
in such cases.
We considered a generalized version of the
DBI action and identified a necessary condition on the form of such
an action for the BM bound to be relaxed.
As a concrete example,
we investigated a version of IR inflation that is driven by
multiple coincident branes and found that
the bounds on the tensor-scalar ratio can indeed
be made compatible if the brane charges satisfy appropriate
conditions.
The upper bound on FORMULA  that we derived in section 3 arises
because the warp factor in standard DBI models
completely specifies the kinetic
energy of the inflaton field. Deriving a corresponding bound for
the generalized model (REF ) would be more involved,
since the CMB normalization (REF ) only
directly constrains the function
FORMULA  and this may not necessarily depend on the warp factor.
Nonetheless, the constraints (REF ) and
(REF ) can be
combined with Eq. (REF ) to derive a limit
on the tensor-scalar ratio in terms of the warp factor and the
kinetic function (REF ) and we find that
FORMULA 
For a specific model where the warp factor and
the functions FORMULA  are determined by particle
physics considerations,
condition (REF )
may be interpreted as a bound that relates
the tensor modes directly to the value of the inflaton field during observable
inflation. This constraint provides a consistency
check that any given model must satisfy
irrespective of the form of the inflaton potential.
In conclusion, therefore, primordial gravitational wave constraints
combined with cosmological observations of the density perturbation
spectrum act as a powerful discriminant of DBI inflationary models.
They also serve as an important
observational guide for identifying viable
generalizations of the scenario.
