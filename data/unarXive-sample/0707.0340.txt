Previous work has established the asymptotic value of

1971–1974), and when
all entries of FORMULA  equal FORMULA , all entries of FORMULA 
equal FORMULA , and
FORMULA  for sufficiently large FORMULA  (Canfield
and McKay, 2007). In this paper we extend the sparse range to
the case FORMULA . The proof in part follows a previous
asymptotic enumeration of 0-1 matrices under the same conditions
(Greenhill, McKay and Wang, 2006).
We also generalise the enumeration
to matrices over any subset of
the nonnegative integers that includes 0 and 1.
Introduction
Let FORMULA 
and FORMULA 
be vectors of nonnegative integers with
equal sum FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be the set of all FORMULA  matrices
with nonnegative integer entries such that the
FORMULA th row has row sum FORMULA  and the FORMULA th column has
column sum FORMULA  for each FORMULA .
Then define FORMULA  to be the number of
such matrices.
Our task in this paper is to determine the asymptotic value of
FORMULA  as FORMULA  under suitable conditions
on FORMULA  and FORMULA .
The matrices FORMULA  appear in many combinatorial contexts;
see Stanley {{cite:63f6f8e2-72b3-445d-9079-baa76406b982}} for a brief history.
A large body of statistical literature is devoted to them
under the name of contingency tables or
frequency tables; see {{cite:a7a82a67-2303-4376-876a-ff3a13e530a5}}, {{cite:392e9537-1835-40af-8d8c-0d4c36b5c1c6}} for
a partial survey.
In theoretical computer science there has been interest in
efficient algorithms for the problem of generating
contingency tables with prescribed margins at random,
and for approximately counting these tables.
See for example {{cite:65269f0e-24c2-4d03-b0e4-2bfadbf57d41}}, {{cite:e4a56750-458b-4450-b150-7e9a79780a1a}}, {{cite:b1e89fb4-b3e4-498d-83cb-b436fbe650c4}}.
The history of the enumeration problem
for nonnegative integer matrices is surveyed in {{cite:0a5689f9-8915-4427-8dc5-69c87396d6f8}},
while a history for the corresponding problem
for 0-1 matrices is given in {{cite:a7b7e45b-8aa9-4aa3-a7b8-29e9f1740b7a}}.
Here we recall only the few previous exact results on
asymptotic enumeration for nonnegative integer
matrices.
Define FORMULA  and FORMULA .
The first non-trivial case FORMULA 
was solved by Read {{cite:bc2efb83-69bf-465f-9f23-dcb08552af00}} in 1958.
During the period 1971–74,
this was generalised to bounded FORMULA  by three independent groups:
Békéssy, Békéssy and Komlós {{cite:11ddbba4-cc7d-4d6e-9a0c-c6d2da393503}},
Bender {{cite:5b9b80c1-8c4a-4569-a0bd-3ee787e71547}}, and Everett and Stein {{cite:ba6910b1-2b9e-498c-bf7d-36f6f25a8010}},
under slightly different conditions.
In the case of denser matrices, the only precise asymptotics were
found by Canfield and McKay {{cite:0a5689f9-8915-4427-8dc5-69c87396d6f8}} in the case that
the row sums are all the same and the column sums are all the same.
Let FORMULA , where the
vectors have length FORMULA , FORMULA , respectively, and FORMULA .
Theorem 1.1 ({{cite:0a5689f9-8915-4427-8dc5-69c87396d6f8}}) 
Let FORMULA , FORMULA  be positive integers satisfying FORMULA .
Define FORMULA . Let FORMULA  be constants
such that FORMULA . Suppose that FORMULA 
in such a way that
FORMULA 
Define FORMULA  by

FORMULA 
+ (m,s;n,t)m+n).

Then FORMULA  as FORMULA .   

Canfield and McKay conjectured that in fact FORMULA 
for all FORMULA . The results in the present paper establish
that conjecture for sufficiently large FORMULA  in the case
FORMULA . (See Corollary REF .)
The main result in this paper is the asymptotic value of
FORMULA  for FORMULA .
Our proof uses the method of switchings in a number of different ways.
In several aspects our approach is parallel to that
which provided our previous asymptotic
estimate of FORMULA , the number of 0-1 matrices in the class
FORMULA . We now restate that result for convenience.
For any FORMULA , define FORMULA  and for a positive integer FORMULA ,
FORMULA . Also define
FORMULA 
for FORMULA . Note that FORMULA .
Theorem 1.2 ({{cite:a7b7e45b-8aa9-4aa3-a7b8-29e9f1740b7a}}) 
 Let FORMULA 
and FORMULA 
be vectors of nonnegative integers with
equal sum FORMULA .
Suppose that FORMULA , FORMULA 
and FORMULA . Then
FORMULA 

We now state our main result, which is the asymptotic value
of FORMULA  for sufficiently sparse matrices. Note
that the answer is obtained by multiplying the expression
for FORMULA  from Theorem REF  by a simple
adjustment factor.
Theorem 1.3 
 Let FORMULA 
and FORMULA 
be vectors of nonnegative integers with
equal sum FORMULA .
Suppose that FORMULA , FORMULA 
and FORMULA . Then
FORMULA 

The proof of this theorem is presented in Sections 
and .
First we show that the set of matrices in FORMULA 
with an entry greater than 3 forms a vanishingly small proportion
of FORMULA . We also show that it is very unusual
for an element of FORMULA  to have a “large”
number of entries equal to 2 or a “large” number of entries equal
to 3, where “largeness” is defined in Section .
We establish these facts using switchings
on the matrix entries. This allows us to
concentrate on matrices in FORMULA  with no entries
greater than 3 and not very many entries equal to 2 or 3.
We then proceed in Section 
to compare the number of these matrices with
the number FORMULA  of FORMULA -matrices with row sums
FORMULA  and column sums FORMULA .
We do this by adapting
the results from {{cite:a7b7e45b-8aa9-4aa3-a7b8-29e9f1740b7a}} used to prove Theorem REF .
These calculations are carried out
in the pairing model, which is described in
Section . Our theorem follows
on combining Lemmas REF , REF  and
Corollary REF .
In the semiregular case where FORMULA  for FORMULA 
and FORMULA  for FORMULA , Theorem REF  says
the following.
Corollary 1.4 Suppose that FORMULA  and that FORMULA  for
nonnegative integer functions FORMULA , FORMULA 
and FORMULA .
If FORMULA  then
FORMULA 

For some applications the statement of Theorem REF 
is not very convenient. In Section 
we will derive an alternative formulation,
very similar to one given for FORMULA  in {{cite:a7b7e45b-8aa9-4aa3-a7b8-29e9f1740b7a}}.
For FORMULA , define
FORMULA 

To motivate the definitions, recall that FORMULA  is the mean value of FORMULA 
and FORMULA  is the mean value of FORMULA , so these are scaled central moments.
We will prove Corollary REF , stated in Section ,
which has the following special case.
Corollary 1.5 
Under the conditions of Theorem REF ,
if FORMULA  then

FORMULA 
12FORMULA 
(1-2)(1-2)
+O(stS2/3)).
   
FORMULA 
Corollary REF  has an instructive interpretation.
Following {{cite:0a5689f9-8915-4427-8dc5-69c87396d6f8}},
we write FORMULA , where

FORMULA 
(1-2)(1-2)
+O(stS2/3)).

Clearly, FORMULA  is the number of FORMULA  nonnegative
matrices whose entries sum to FORMULA . In the uniform
probability space on these FORMULA  matrices, FORMULA  is the
probability of the event that the row sums are given by FORMULA 
and FORMULA  is the probability of the event that the column sums
are given by FORMULA .
The final quantity FORMULA  is thus a correction to account for
the non-independence of these two events.
Finally, in
Section  we show how to generalise
Theorem REF  to matrices whose entries are restricted
to any subset of the natural numbers that includes 0 and 1.
A note on our usage of the FORMULA  notation in the following is in order.
Given a fixed
function FORMULA , and any quantity FORMULA  that depends on
any of our variables, FORMULA  denotes any quantity whose absolute
value is bounded above by FORMULA  for some constant FORMULA  that
depends on FORMULA 
and nothing else, provided that FORMULA .
Switchings on matrices
In this section we will show
that the condition FORMULA  implies that most matrices
have no entries greater than 3. We also find bounds on the
number of entries equal to 2 or 3.
Our tool will be the method of switchings, which we will
analyse using results of
Fack and McKay {{cite:9bd34550-d8b0-4abd-9da1-ad7ab794895a}} from which we
will distill the following special case.
Theorem 2.1 
Let FORMULA  be a finite simple acyclic directed graph, with
each FORMULA  being associated with a finite set FORMULA ,
these sets being disjoint.
Suppose that FORMULA  is a multiset of ordered pairs
such that for each FORMULA  there is an edge
FORMULA  with FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Further suppose that
FORMULA  are positive functions such
that, for each FORMULA ,
FORMULA 

where the left hand sides are multiset cardinalities.
Let FORMULA . Then there is a directed
path FORMULA  in FORMULA , where FORMULA  and
FORMULA  is a sink, such that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is defined by
FORMULA 

This follows from Theorems 1 and 2 of {{cite:9bd34550-d8b0-4abd-9da1-ad7ab794895a}}.
For FORMULA , a FORMULA -switching is described by the sequence
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is a matrix in FORMULA 
and FORMULA  is a FORMULA -tuple
of positions such that

the rows FORMULA  are all distinct and the columns
FORMULA  are all distinct;

there is a FORMULA  in position FORMULA  of FORMULA ;

the entries in positions FORMULA  of FORMULA  are
not equal to 0 or FORMULA , for FORMULA ;

there is a 0 in position FORMULA  and position
FORMULA  of FORMULA  for FORMULA .

This FORMULA -switching transforms FORMULA  into a matrix
FORMULA  by acting on the FORMULA 
submatrix consisting of rows FORMULA 
and columns FORMULA  as follows:
FORMULA 
Matrix entries not shown can have any values and are unchanged by
the switching operation.
Notice that the FORMULA -switching preserves all row and column sums and
reduces the number of entries equal to FORMULA  by at least 1 and
at most FORMULA . The number of entries greater than FORMULA  is unchanged.
A reverse FORMULA -switching, which undoes a
FORMULA -switching (and vice-versa),
is described by a sequence
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  is a
FORMULA -tuple of positions such that

the rows FORMULA  are all distinct and the columns
FORMULA  are all distinct;

there is a zero in position FORMULA  of FORMULA ;

the entries in positions FORMULA  of FORMULA  are
not equal to FORMULA , for FORMULA ;

there is a 1 in position FORMULA  and position
FORMULA  of FORMULA  for FORMULA .


Lemma 2.2 
Let FORMULA  and let FORMULA  have at least FORMULA 
non-zero entries that are not greater than FORMULA , and at least
FORMULA  entries equal to FORMULA .
Then there are at least FORMULA  FORMULA -switchings
and at most FORMULA  reverse FORMULA -switchings that apply to FORMULA .

First consider FORMULA -switchings.
We want a lower bound on the number of
FORMULA -tuples FORMULA 
of indices where a FORMULA -switching may be performed.
There are at least FORMULA  ways to choose the position FORMULA .
Then we can choose the remaining positions one at a time, avoiding
choices which violate the rules. The choice of the last position
FORMULA  is the most restricted, so we bound that.
By assumption, there are at least FORMULA  nonzero entries in FORMULA 
that are not greater than FORMULA .
Of these we must exclude the entry in position FORMULA 
as well as entries in the same column as a nonzero entry in row
FORMULA  other than column FORMULA  (at most FORMULA  positions),
entries in the same row as a nonzero
entry in column FORMULA  other than row FORMULA  (at most FORMULA  positions), and entries
in row FORMULA  or column FORMULA  for FORMULA  (at most
FORMULA  positions).
Overall, we can choose position FORMULA  in at least
FORMULA 
ways, and as we noted this also applies to
each of the less restricted positions FORMULA , where
FORMULA . Hence at most FORMULA 
FORMULA -switchings involve FORMULA .
Next consider reverse FORMULA -switchings.
An ordered sequence of FORMULA  entries in the same row which
equal 1 may be chosen in at most FORMULA  ways, and an ordered sequence
of FORMULA  entries in the same column which equal 1 may be chosen in at
most FORMULA  ways. Some of these choices will not give a legal position
for a reverse FORMULA -switching, but FORMULA  is certainly an
upper bound.
Our first application of switchings will be to show that only
a vanishing fraction of our matrices have any entries greater
than 3.
For FORMULA  and FORMULA , let FORMULA  be the set of all
matrices in FORMULA  with exactly FORMULA  entries equal to FORMULA  and none
greater than FORMULA . Define FORMULA ,
and note that FORMULA .
Lemma 2.3 
Suppose that FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be the set of all matrices in FORMULA 
which contain an entry greater than 3. Then
FORMULA 

The largest possible entry of a matrix in FORMULA 
is FORMULA . We will apply
Theorem REF  to successively bound the possibility that the
maximum entry is FORMULA , for FORMULA .
Fix FORMULA  with FORMULA .
Define a directed graph FORMULA  with vertex set
FORMULA 
and edge set FORMULA .
Associate each FORMULA  with the set FORMULA .
Define FORMULA  to be the set of pairs FORMULA  related by a
FORMULA -switching, where FORMULA  for some FORMULA .
Define FORMULA .
Note that FORMULA  since FORMULA .
We can now use Theorem REF  to bound
FORMULA 
once we have found
positive functions FORMULA  satisfying (REF ).
These are provided by Lemma REF  with FORMULA  and
FORMULA , the latter being clear since there are no entries
greater than FORMULA  and the total of all the entries is FORMULA .
We have FORMULA  since
FORMULA .
Thus we can take FORMULA  and
FORMULA .
Theorem REF  tells us that, unless FORMULA ,
there is a directed path FORMULA ,
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  (since FORMULA  is
the only sink) such that (REF ) holds.
Hence, using the values of FORMULA  as given in Theorem REF 
we have
FORMULA 

Let FORMULA  denote this upper bound: that is,
FORMULA  for FORMULA .
Note that FORMULA . For
FORMULA , we have FORMULA  and
FORMULA 

uniformly over FORMULA , where the last step uses the observation
that
FORMULA .
Since FORMULA 
and FORMULA  for FORMULA ,
we have FORMULA 
as required.
We may therefore restrict our attention to matrices with no
entry greater than 3.
Next we find upper bounds on the numbers of entries equal
to 2 or 3 which hold with high probability.
Define
FORMULA 

(Here and throughout the paper we have not attempted to optimise constants.)
We will use the following lemma.
Lemma 2.4 
Let FORMULA  be a positive integer and let FORMULA  and FORMULA 
be positive real numbers such that FORMULA .
Then
FORMULA 

Dividing the left side by FORMULA  gives, for FORMULA ,
FORMULA 

The second line holds because FORMULA  is a
decreasing function for FORMULA .
The case FORMULA  follows by continuity.
Lemma 2.5 
Let FORMULA .
Then, with probability FORMULA , a random element
of FORMULA  has no entry greater than 3, at most FORMULA 
entries equal to 3, and at most FORMULA  entries equal to 2.

In view of Lemma REF ,
we may restrict our attention to the set FORMULA  of all matrices
in FORMULA  with maximum entry at most 3.
We will start by applying 3-switchings as in
Lemma REF 
but the analysis will be more delicate.
In applying Theorem REF  we have FORMULA ,
with FORMULA  associated with FORMULA , and FORMULA .
For sufficiently large FORMULA , we have from Lemma REF  that
we can take FORMULA  and FORMULA .
If FORMULA  then entries equal to 3 are impossible, so
we assume that FORMULA .
Define FORMULA .
According to Theorem REF , there is a sequence
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  and
FORMULA  for all FORMULA ,
such that
FORMULA 

where FORMULA  is the largest index such that FORMULA  and
FORMULA  for all FORMULA .
Define FORMULA .
Since FORMULA , we have FORMULA .
Also, for FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
Therefore,
FORMULA 

Since FORMULA  we can apply Lemma REF 
to obtain the bound
FORMULA 
Now FORMULA ,
and FORMULA ,
so this upper bound is at most
FORMULA 
This shows that with probability
FORMULA  there are at most FORMULA  entries equal to 3, as required.
To bound the number of entries equal to 2, we proceed in
the same manner using 2-switchings, working under the
assumption that there are at most FORMULA  entries equal to 3
and none greater than 3.
In applying Lemma REF ,
we can take FORMULA , so that
FORMULA  for sufficiently large FORMULA .
Define FORMULA .
Arguing as above we find a sequence
FORMULA 
with the following properties: (i) FORMULA  and
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA , and
(ii)
if FORMULA  is the greatest integer such that FORMULA  then,
for any FORMULA  with FORMULA ,
the probability that there are
more than FORMULA  entries equal to 2, subject to there being at
most FORMULA  equal to 3, is bounded above by
FORMULA 
First suppose that FORMULA , so that FORMULA  and
FORMULA .
Since FORMULA , it follows that FORMULA .
Taking FORMULA  in (REF ) gives
FORMULA 
Now suppose that FORMULA .
Then FORMULA 
so we can take FORMULA .
Arguing as above by applying Lemma REF  to (REF ),
we obtain the bound FORMULA  again.
This completes the proof.
From now on we proceed in two cases, as in {{cite:a7b7e45b-8aa9-4aa3-a7b8-29e9f1740b7a}}.
Say that the pair FORMULA  is substantial if the
following conditions hold:

FORMULA ,

FORMULA  and FORMULA ,

FORMULA .

Lemma 2.6 
If FORMULA  and FORMULA  is insubstantial,
then with probability FORMULA , a random element of
FORMULA  has no entry greater than 3, at
most one entry equal to 3 and at most two entries equal to 2.

The absence of entries greater than 3 follows from Lemma REF .
We can also, by Lemma REF , assume that the number
of entries equal to 2 or 3 is FORMULA .
Therefore, most of the matrix entries are 0 or 1.
Let FORMULA  be the set of all matrices in FORMULA  with no entries
greater than 3, at most FORMULA 
entries equal to 2 and at most FORMULA  entries equal to 3.
To bound the number of entries equal to 2 or 3 even more tightly,
as this lemma requires, we employ FORMULA -switchings (FORMULA ) with
the additional restriction that FORMULA .
This ensures
that these restricted FORMULA -switchings reduce the number
of entries equal to FORMULA 
by exactly one and do not create any new entries equal to 2 or 3.
Let FORMULA  be the number of matrices in FORMULA  with FORMULA 
entries equal to 3.
If FORMULA  is such a matrix then the number of restricted
3-switchings applicable to FORMULA  is FORMULA 
and the number of reverse restricted 3-switchings is
at most FORMULA .
(This follows using arguments similar to those in Lemma REF ,
since there are FORMULA  entries equal to 1.)
Therefore, if the denominator is nonzero,
FORMULA 
We can now easily check that each of the three causes
of insubstantiality (namely, FORMULA , FORMULA ,
and
FORMULA ) imply that
FORMULA 
Hence (REF ) implies that
FORMULA 
In precisely the same way, using restricted 2-switchings,
we find that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the number of matrices in FORMULA  with
FORMULA  entries equal to 2 and at most one entry equal to 3.
The lemma follows.

From pairings to matrices
The remainder of the paper will involve calculations in the
pairing model, which we now describe.
(This model is standard for working with random bipartite
graphs of fixed degrees: see for example {{cite:0fd33fd5-586a-43db-9a01-d55df345b32d}}.)
Consider a set of FORMULA  points arranged in cells
FORMULA , where cell FORMULA  has size FORMULA  for FORMULA ,
and another set of FORMULA  points
arranged in cells FORMULA  where cell FORMULA  has size FORMULA 
for FORMULA .
Take a partition FORMULA  (called a pairing) of the FORMULA  points
into FORMULA  pairs with each pair having the form FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  for some FORMULA .
The set of all such pairings, of which there are FORMULA ,
will be denoted by FORMULA .
We work in the uniform probability space on FORMULA .
Two pairs are called parallel if they involve the same
two cells.
A parallel class is a maximal set of mutually
parallel pairs.
The multiplicity of a parallel class (and of the
pairs in the class) is the cardinality of the class.
As important special cases,
a simple pair is a parallel class of multiplicity one,
a double pair is a parallel class of multiplicity two,
while a triple pair is a parallel class of multiplicity
three.
Each pairing FORMULA  gives rise to a matrix
in FORMULA  by letting the FORMULA -th entry of the matrix equal
the multiplicity of the parallel class from FORMULA  to FORMULA  in FORMULA .
In {{cite:a7b7e45b-8aa9-4aa3-a7b8-29e9f1740b7a}} we noted that the number of pairings which gives
rise to each 0-1 matrix in FORMULA 
depends only on FORMULA  and FORMULA  and is independent of the
structure of the matrix. Hence the task of counting such
matrices reduces to finding the fraction of pairings that
have no multiplicities greater than 1.
More generally, matrices in FORMULA  correspond to different
numbers of pairings.
For a pairing FORMULA , define the multiplicity vector
of FORMULA  to be FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the number of parallel classes of multiplicity FORMULA .
Also define the weight of FORMULA  as
FORMULA 
For FORMULA , define FORMULA  and FORMULA  to be the common
weight and multiplicity vectors of the pairings that yield FORMULA .
By elementary counting, a matrix FORMULA  corresponds
to exactly
FORMULA 
pairings in FORMULA .
Therefore, if FORMULA  is a set of multiplicity vectors,
FORMULA , and
FORMULA , then
FORMULA 
This holds in particular if FORMULA  is the set of all nonnegative
integer sequences, in which case FORMULA  and FORMULA .
We first prove Theorem REF  in the case that FORMULA  is
insubstantial.
Lemma 3.1 
If FORMULA  and FORMULA  is insubstantial
then Theorem REF  holds.

Similarly to {{cite:a7b7e45b-8aa9-4aa3-a7b8-29e9f1740b7a}}, define a doublet
to be to be an unordered set of 2 parallel pairs.
A double pair provides one doublet, while a triple pair
provides 3 doublets.
For the uniform probability space over FORMULA , let FORMULA  be
the expectation of the number of sets of FORMULA  doublets,
for FORMULA .
In {{cite:a7b7e45b-8aa9-4aa3-a7b8-29e9f1740b7a}} it is shown that
FORMULA 
Let FORMULA  denote the probability that a randomly chosen pairing
contains exactly FORMULA  doublets, for FORMULA .
Then
FORMULA 
and the partial sums of
this series alternate above and below FORMULA 
(see for example {{cite:a3f373c5-7575-45a8-a1ef-f5bb46cbfb61}}).
Applying this, we find that
FORMULA 

(The expression for FORMULA  was also derived in {{cite:a7b7e45b-8aa9-4aa3-a7b8-29e9f1740b7a}}.)
The configurations defining these cases are, respectively,
no parallel pairs, one double pair, two double pairs, and one
triple pair.
Applying Lemma REF  and (REF ),
FORMULA 

where we have used the fact that FORMULA  in
the insubstantial case to get the second line.
This expression is equal to the expression in Theorem REF 
under our present assumptions. (Note that since FORMULA  is
insubstantial, the term FORMULA  which appears in the
statement of Theorem REF  is absorbed into the error term.)
For nonnegative integers FORMULA , define FORMULA  to be the set of all pairings in FORMULA  with
exactly FORMULA  double pairs and FORMULA  triple pairs, but no parallel
classes of multiplicity greater than 3.
Also define
FORMULA 
A special case of (REF ), used in {{cite:a7b7e45b-8aa9-4aa3-a7b8-29e9f1740b7a}}, is that the
number of 0-1 matrices in FORMULA  is
FORMULA 
We will proceed by writing FORMULA  in terms of
FORMULA , as follows.
Lemma 3.2 
If FORMULA  is substantial then
FORMULA 

By Lemma REF  and (REF ),
FORMULA 
We will evaluate the sum in Lemma REF 
using two summation lemmas proved in {{cite:a7b7e45b-8aa9-4aa3-a7b8-29e9f1740b7a}} and restated below.
Lemma 3.3 ({{cite:a7b7e45b-8aa9-4aa3-a7b8-29e9f1740b7a}}) 
Let FORMULA  and FORMULA  be real numbers.
Suppose that there exist integers FORMULA , FORMULA  with
FORMULA  and FORMULA , and a real number
FORMULA  such that FORMULA  and FORMULA 
for all FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Further suppose that there are real numbers FORMULA , for FORMULA ,
and FORMULA , for FORMULA , such that
FORMULA 
for FORMULA .
Given FORMULA  and
FORMULA ,
define FORMULA  by FORMULA  and
FORMULA 
for FORMULA , with the following interpretation: if FORMULA 
then FORMULA  for FORMULA .
Then
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 

Lemma 3.4 ({{cite:a7b7e45b-8aa9-4aa3-a7b8-29e9f1740b7a}}) 
Let FORMULA  be an integer and, for FORMULA , let real
numbers FORMULA , FORMULA  be given such that FORMULA  and
FORMULA .
Define
FORMULA , FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Suppose that there exists a real number FORMULA  with
FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA , FORMULA .
Define FORMULA  by FORMULA  and
FORMULA 
for FORMULA , with the following interpretation: if FORMULA 
or FORMULA , then FORMULA  for FORMULA . Then
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 

We obtain bounds on the ratios we require by applying
results from {{cite:a7b7e45b-8aa9-4aa3-a7b8-29e9f1740b7a}}. To begin with we focus
on the effect of changing the number of triple pairs while
keeping the number of double pairs fixed.
Lemma 3.5 
Suppose FORMULA  and FORMULA , with FORMULA .
If FORMULA  is substantial then
FORMULA 

This follows from {{cite:a7b7e45b-8aa9-4aa3-a7b8-29e9f1740b7a}} since, for FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
Next, adapting the proof of {{cite:a7b7e45b-8aa9-4aa3-a7b8-29e9f1740b7a}} gives:
Corollary 3.6 
 Suppose FORMULA  with FORMULA .
Further suppose that
FORMULA  is substantial. Then
FORMULA 

We will apply Lemma REF .
Let FORMULA  be the first value of FORMULA  for which FORMULA , or
FORMULA  if there is no such value.
Define FORMULA , FORMULA , by
FORMULA 
Lemma REF  says that FORMULA  is bounded independently
of FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA .
For FORMULA , define
FORMULA 
If FORMULA  then by definition
FORMULA , and FORMULA 
since FORMULA . Therefore FORMULA  in this case.
If FORMULA  then FORMULA , which implies that FORMULA  since the
right side of (REF )
has the same sign as FORMULA .
Therefore FORMULA  whenever FORMULA .
Define FORMULA  for FORMULA .
Also define FORMULA  for FORMULA .
Define
FORMULA  by taking the minimum and maximum of the
FORMULA  and FORMULA  over FORMULA , as in Lemma REF .
Let FORMULA  and FORMULA , and set
FORMULA .
Since FORMULA  and FORMULA , we have that
FORMULA 
for FORMULA  sufficiently large, by the definition of FORMULA .
Therefore Lemma REF  applies and says that
FORMULA 
Finally, FORMULA .
Since the sum we are estimating is at least equal to one, this additive
error term is covered by the error terms inside the exponential.
This completes the proof.
Now we must sum over pairings with no triple pairs.
Lemma 3.7 
 Suppose that FORMULA  is substantial and that FORMULA 
with FORMULA . Then
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 

This follows from {{cite:a7b7e45b-8aa9-4aa3-a7b8-29e9f1740b7a}} since, for FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
Adapting the proof of {{cite:a7b7e45b-8aa9-4aa3-a7b8-29e9f1740b7a}} gives the following:
Corollary 3.8 
If FORMULA  is substantial then
FORMULA 

We need to apply Lemma REF  to
the result of Lemma REF , and take into account the terms coming
from the triple pairs (as given by Corollary REF ).
Let FORMULA  be the first value of FORMULA  for which FORMULA ,
or FORMULA  if no such value of FORMULA  exists.
Define FORMULA  by
FORMULA 
for FORMULA , and FORMULA  for FORMULA .
Then clearly
FORMULA 
Corollary REF  tells us that for FORMULA  we have
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and in general FORMULA . (Note that (REF )
is also true for FORMULA , since both sides
equal zero.)
If FORMULA  is a constant
such that FORMULA  for FORMULA , then
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
Next we note that, for FORMULA , FORMULA , and for
FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
with FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA  satisfying the expressions given in the
statement of Lemma REF . This follows since the factor
FORMULA  is covered by the error term on FORMULA .
For FORMULA  define FORMULA .
Now let FORMULA , FORMULA ,
where the maximum and minimum are taken over FORMULA .
Also let FORMULA , and FORMULA , and define FORMULA 
if FORMULA  and FORMULA  otherwise.
The conditions of Lemma REF  now hold as we will show.
Let FORMULA  be arbitrary.
Clearly FORMULA .
If FORMULA  then FORMULA . Using the condition
FORMULA  implied by the substantiality of
FORMULA , we find that FORMULA .
For FORMULA , FORMULA .
It is also easy to check that FORMULA .
Thus, in all cases we have that FORMULA  and
FORMULA  for sufficiently large FORMULA .
If FORMULA  then
FORMULA 
while if FORMULA  then
FORMULA 
Finally, for FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 

where
FORMULA 
Since FORMULA ,
which is easily checked, it
follows that FORMULA  for FORMULA ,
when FORMULA  is large enough.
Therefore the conditions of Lemma REF  hold,
and we conclude that each of the bounds given by that
lemma for FORMULA  has the form
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is either FORMULA  or FORMULA .
A somewhat tedious check shows that
FORMULA 
Next consider the error term FORMULA .
If FORMULA  then FORMULA ,
while in the other cases we have
FORMULA .
Since FORMULA ,
this additive error term is covered by a relative error of the same form.
Therefore, each of the bounds on FORMULA 
has the form
FORMULA 

Modulo the given error terms, the final expression does not depend
on FORMULA , nor on whether we are taking a lower bound or upper bound
in Lemma REF .
To complete the proof, just apply (REF ).
Corollary REF  and Lemma REF  together prove
Theorem REF  in the substantial case.
The insubstantial case was already proved in Lemma REF .

Alternative formulation
We now derive an alternative formulation of Theorem REF .
Recall the definition
of FORMULA  and FORMULA  given in the Introduction.
Corollary 4.1 
Under the conditions of Theorem REF ,
FORMULA 

By Stirling's formula or otherwise,
FORMULA 
as FORMULA , provided that the error term is bounded.
This gives us the approximations
FORMULA 

Substitute these expressions into Theorem REF 
and replace FORMULA  by their equivalents in terms of
FORMULA .
The desired result is obtained.
As noted in the Introduction, Theorem REF  establishes the
conjecture recalled after Theorem REF  in some cases.
Using Corollary REF , the following is easily seen.
(Note that FORMULA 
in the semiregular case.)
Corollary 4.2 
If FORMULA  and FORMULA  satisfy FORMULA  and
FORMULA , then
FORMULA 

Most of the terms inside the exponential of Corollary REF 
are tiny unless at least one of
FORMULA , FORMULA 
is quite large (that is, the graph is very far from
semiregular). In particular we can now prove Corollary REF 
which was stated in the Introduction.
[Proof of Corollary REF ]
It is only necessary to check that the additional terms in
Corollary REF  have the required size.
It helps to realise that FORMULA ,
FORMULA , FORMULA 
and FORMULA .
A random nonnegative FORMULA  matrix with entries summing to FORMULA 
is just a random composition of FORMULA  into FORMULA  parts. (A composition
is an ordered sum of nonnegative numbers.)
In particular, for FORMULA  the row sum FORMULA  satisfies
FORMULA 
From this we can
compute the following expected values.
FORMULA 

The first two expectations suggest that the argument of the
exponential in Corollary REF  is close to 0 with high
probability for such a random matrix. We will prove this in a
future paper, and note that the result gives a model for the
row and column sums of random matrices.

Restricted sets of allowed entries
Given a subset FORMULA  of the nonnegative integers,
let FORMULA  denote the set of
matrices in FORMULA  with all entries in the
set FORMULA .
Let FORMULA .
By generalising the techniques of the preceding sections, we
can find an asymptotic expression for
FORMULA  whenever FORMULA .
Lemma 5.1 Let FORMULA  with FORMULA .
Define FORMULA  if FORMULA , FORMULA  if FORMULA ,
and similarly FORMULA .
Then
FORMULA 

Our general approach will be similar to that we used for
Theorem REF , but
the methods of Section  will need significant
modification. The source of the problem is that a FORMULA -switching
may introduce an entry that is not in FORMULA .
For FORMULA  and FORMULA , let FORMULA  be the number of entries
of FORMULA  equal to FORMULA . Also let FORMULA .
Define FORMULA  and FORMULA  as in Section  when
FORMULA  is substantial, and FORMULA  and FORMULA  when
FORMULA  is insubstantial.
Consider the following subsets of FORMULA :
FORMULA 

Also define the cardinalities FORMULA , respectively.
By monotonicity, we have FORMULA  and
FORMULA .
We now employ switchings to establish that FORMULA 
and FORMULA , from which it follows that
FORMULA .
We start with the claim that FORMULA . This is
accomplished with a succession of four types of switchings, illustrated by
the following operations on submatrices.
FORMULA 

To be precise, given any FORMULA , we apply the
first switching until FORMULA , then the second switching
until FORMULA , then the third
switching until FORMULA , then
finally the fourth switching until FORMULA . Since none of the
switchings can undo the work of a previous switching, the end
result is a matrix in FORMULA .
(Note that in the resulting matrix FORMULA , at least one of FORMULA ,
FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  has value FORMULA .
This implies that FORMULA .)
Quantitatively, in each of
the four phases, we remove a part of FORMULA  which
is small compared to FORMULA .
As a representative example, take the second switching.
By counting similarly to Lemma REF , the second switching can
be applied to FORMULA  in at least FORMULA  ways, and the
inverse can be applied in at most FORMULA  ways. For
FORMULA , the condition FORMULA  implies that
FORMULA , so the ratios that play the part
denoted by FORMULA  in Theorem REF  are all FORMULA .
The same type of argument applies in all four phases, which establishes
the bound FORMULA .
When FORMULA , we know that FORMULA .
We can now continue precisely as in Lemmas REF , REF ,
using FORMULA -switchings restricted to FORMULA .
This restriction ensures that FORMULA -switchings only create entries
with value equal to 0 or 1.
The various switching counts can be
taken as essentially the same as before, since
all but a vanishing fraction
of the non-zero entries are 1.
We conclude that FORMULA  which, as noted above,
implies that FORMULA .
Having now reduced the task to evaluation of FORMULA , we can
complete the proof following Lemma REF  in the
insubstantial case, and Section 4 in the substantial case.
In Lemma REF  the only modification is to replace
the expression FORMULA  by
FORMULA .
Now suppose that FORMULA  is substantial.
If FORMULA  then the result is given by either
Theorem REF  or Theorem REF .
If FORMULA  and FORMULA  then the result follows from applying
Corollary REF  with FORMULA , since arguing as in Lemma REF 
shows that
FORMULA 
in this case.
Finally, if FORMULA  and FORMULA 
then
FORMULA 
so in place of (REF ) we simply have
FORMULA  for FORMULA .
The remainder of the proof is identical except that there is
no need to apply (REF ) at the end.
