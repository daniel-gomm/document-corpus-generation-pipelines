We report a detailed inelastic neutron scattering study of the collective magnetic
excitations of overdoped superconducting LaFORMULA SrFORMULA CuOFORMULA  for the energy
range 0–160 meV. Our measurements show that overdoping suppresses the strong response
present for optimally doped LaFORMULA SrFORMULA CuOFORMULA  which is peaked near 50 meV. The
remaining response is peaked at incommensurate wavevectors for all energies investigated.
We observe a strong high-frequency magnetic response for FORMULA  meV suggesting
that significant antiferromagnetic exchange couplings persist well into the overdoped
part of the cuprate phase diagram.

The occurrence of high-temperature superconductivity is widely believed to be connected
to the cuprates' spin degrees of freedom {{cite:82e1c13b-666f-46cf-8b8b-8c2f820e474d}}. Thus, we might expect
strong spin fluctuations to co-exist with superconductivity over the whole
superconducting phase diagram. The spin excitations have been well characterised for the
insulating antiferromagnetic (AF) {{cite:8fc14fae-13ef-4b0a-af42-bf64c98c3b95}} and lightly-doped
{{cite:6f420f6a-f087-41a5-bb02-2bedae570531}}, {{cite:e665c91f-a2fc-4d20-8474-6949bd42ee40}}, {{cite:2891cd6e-2017-4830-b801-b611b7403f3f}}, {{cite:898a690c-7e43-471b-9b8e-59731251dbb3}} compositions. For optimally doped
compositions, structured excitations have been observed over a wide energy range
{{cite:d3354950-84f9-48df-bed3-7f4b821c5b45}}, {{cite:1cde0dde-be47-4e62-897c-ee2f00f87987}}. However, little is known about the high-energy spin
dynamics on the overdoped side of the cuprate phase diagram. One of the best materials to
investigate this region is single layer LaFORMULA SrFORMULA CuOFORMULA  (LSCO). This system
can be doped sufficiently to destroy the superconductive behavior {{cite:3fca2818-2df0-4872-86a1-e5eec21eb67a}},
allowing the spin excitations to be studied across the entire superconducting dome.
Studying the overdoped part of the phase diagram offers a different view on the emergence
of the superconducting state. In contrast to the underdoped regime, superconductivity
does not emerge from the `pseudogap' state {{cite:8a9f60e1-5212-41e2-a0aa-3534fb5f01a9}}. Rather, it emerges from
what appears to be a strongly correlated metallic state {{cite:776d71e2-2d90-4116-829a-0c10168d7cb8}}.
In this letter, we report an inelastic neutron scattering (INS) study of the magnetic
response FORMULA  of an overdoped superconducting sample
over a wide energy range (0–160 meV) and throughout the Brillouin zone. We have chosen
the composition LaFORMULA SrFORMULA CuOFORMULA  (FORMULA  K), which shows a substantial
drop in FORMULA  with respect to optimal doping but is nevertheless superconducting (see
Fig. REF ). We find that the spin excitations are dramatically
modified from those observed at optimal doping: The strong peak in the local
susceptibility FORMULA  present {{cite:1cde0dde-be47-4e62-897c-ee2f00f87987}} in
LaFORMULA SrFORMULA CuOFORMULA  near 50 meV is suppressed, and the remaining response is
incommensurate and strongest around FORMULA  meV and FORMULA  meV. Thus,
strong spin excitations persist well into the overdoped region of the cuprate phase
diagram as required by magnetically mediated models of superconductivity.
FIGURE 
LaFORMULA SrFORMULA CuOFORMULA  has a tetragonal structure and we use tetragonal indexing
to label reciprocal space
FORMULA . The magnetic
excitations in LSCO are 2D as the strongest magnetic couplings are within the CuOFORMULA 
planes. Thus, usually we quote in-plane components of FORMULA . In this notation,
the parent compound of the series, LaFORMULA CuOFORMULA , exhibits AF order with an ordering
vector of FORMULA  and FORMULA  points along the Cu–O bonds. Seven single
crystals with a total mass of 75 g were co-aligned with a total mosaic of 0.8FORMULA .
The crystals were grown by a traveling-solvent floating-zone technique {{cite:7c6c147b-dadb-470e-b097-c70a7f3303b9}}
and annealed with one bar of oxygen for six weeks at 800FORMULA C. The Sr stoichiometry
was measured with SEM-EDX and ICP-AES to be FORMULA . Magnetization
measurements [see Fig. REF (b)] indicate that FORMULA  K.

INS probes the energy and wavevector dependence of FORMULA . The magnetic cross section is given by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA =0.2905 barn srFORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA 
are the incident and final neutron wavevectors and FORMULA  is the anisotropic
magnetic form factor for a CuFORMULA  FORMULA  orbital.
Data were placed on an absolute scale using a V standard.
The magnetic response of the cuprates is dominated by the unpaired FORMULA  electrons of
CuFORMULA  ions. The AF parent compound LaFORMULA CuOFORMULA  displays spin waves
{{cite:8fc14fae-13ef-4b0a-af42-bf64c98c3b95}}, which disperse out from FORMULA  position. For doped
superconducting compositions, the low-energy (FORMULA  meV) excitations of
LaFORMULA SrFORMULA CuOFORMULA  are peaked at FORMULA  and FORMULA 
{{cite:8c7cef3c-bfaa-4072-82da-d870fba4ed8e}}, {{cite:7128639f-b507-41cd-af95-827c78a7ae77}}. The low-energy incommensurability of the excitations
FORMULA  increases with FORMULA  and saturates with FORMULA 
{{cite:59b9dfcd-1eb1-4189-92ef-5984b11d80f6}}, {{cite:3fca2818-2df0-4872-86a1-e5eec21eb67a}}. It has recently been shown that FORMULA  of
LaFORMULA SrFORMULA CuOFORMULA  and LaFORMULA BaFORMULA CuOFORMULA  disperses
{{cite:f09c204e-afc7-4b08-af7a-ae19adec8237}}, {{cite:3675f18c-9d07-481c-bed9-1530ab31e115}}, {{cite:1cde0dde-be47-4e62-897c-ee2f00f87987}} with energy and shows a minimum near
FORMULA  meV. The high-energy (FORMULA  meV) response in optimally doped
LaFORMULA SrFORMULA CuOFORMULA  appears to be more isotopic, possibly with incommensurate
(IC) peaks rotated by FORMULA  in the FORMULA  plane {{cite:1cde0dde-be47-4e62-897c-ee2f00f87987}}. Interestingly,
a similar `hourglass' dispersion has been observed {{cite:684daefa-8567-4254-a60f-96ef5043bbb9}}, {{cite:88d6e4c6-34ab-449a-bb70-37a7a4b17920}}, {{cite:898a690c-7e43-471b-9b8e-59731251dbb3}}
in YBaFORMULA CuFORMULA OFORMULA .

Our INS experiments were performed on the MAPS instrument at the ISIS spallation source.
MAPS is a direct-geometry time-of-flight chopper spectrometer with position-sensitive
detectors. This allows a large region of reciprocal space to be sampled using a single
setting with a given incident energy FORMULA . In order to identify and minimize phonon
contamination of our results we collected data for seven different FORMULA 's. Each FORMULA 
allows a given FORMULA  position to be probed for a different FORMULA  value [see Fig
REF (d)]. The magnetic scattering in LSCO depends only on the out-of-plane
wavevector FORMULA  through FORMULA , whereas phonon scattering is
strongly dependent on FORMULA . We excluded data from our final results if it satisfied any of
the following criteria: (i) A clearly identified phonon branch could be seen to cross the
FORMULA  region. (ii) The pattern was not four-fold symmetric around FORMULA 
(after subtracting a background quadratic in FORMULA ). (iii) The fitted value of
FORMULA  was more than twice (including errors) that found at the
same FORMULA  for a different FORMULA . The excluding procedure was only required below the
phonon cut-off energy of 90 meV.
Fig. REF  shows FORMULA  of LSCO(FORMULA =0.22) as
slices at various energies. Corresponding cuts through the raw data along the FORMULA 
line are plotted in Fig. REF . The low-FORMULA  cut in Fig. REF (a) at
FORMULA =11 meV shows the well-known four-peak structure
{{cite:8c7cef3c-bfaa-4072-82da-d870fba4ed8e}}, {{cite:3fca2818-2df0-4872-86a1-e5eec21eb67a}}, {{cite:7128639f-b507-41cd-af95-827c78a7ae77}}, {{cite:59b9dfcd-1eb1-4189-92ef-5984b11d80f6}}, {{cite:f09c204e-afc7-4b08-af7a-ae19adec8237}}, {{cite:3675f18c-9d07-481c-bed9-1530ab31e115}}, {{cite:1cde0dde-be47-4e62-897c-ee2f00f87987}}.
The structure is considerably weaker at FORMULA =14 meV [Fig. REF (b) and
Fig. REF (b)] and has almost disappeared for FORMULA =30 meV and FORMULA =50 meV
[Fig. REF (c)-(d) and Fig. REF (c)-(d)]. This behavior is in
contrast to optimally doped LaFORMULA SrFORMULA CuOFORMULA 
{{cite:3675f18c-9d07-481c-bed9-1530ab31e115}}, {{cite:1cde0dde-be47-4e62-897c-ee2f00f87987}}, where the IC response is strongest around FORMULA  meV and there is a strong response centered on FORMULA  for energies in
the range FORMULA =40–50 meV. At higher energies, the magnetic response reemerges for
FORMULA =100 meV [Fig.REF (e) and Fig. REF (e)] and FORMULA =140 meV
[Fig.REF (f) and Fig. REF (f)]. The high-FORMULA  response is
significantly broader in FORMULA  and FORMULA  is
weaker than the low-FORMULA  response. However, as we shall see below, when integrated in
FORMULA  and FORMULA  it dominates the magnetic response.
We used a modified lorentzian function to make a quantitative analysis of the data:
FORMULA 
with
FORMULA 
where the position of the four peaks is determined by FORMULA , FORMULA  is an inverse
correlation length (peak width), and FORMULA  controls the shape of the pattern
(FORMULA =4 yields four distinct peaks and FORMULA =0 a pattern with circular symmetry
{{cite:234c4e8d-c643-4a65-8aad-6326e315fa1c}}). This phenomenological response function provides a good
description of the data at all energies. Fig. REF (g)-(l) show 2D fits of
Eq. REF  to the corresponding slices (a)-(f). The parameters extracted
from fitting the resolution-convolved model to the 2D slices are shown in
Fig. REF (a)-(c). We have expressed the strength of the magnetic response in
terms of the wavevector-averaged or local susceptibility
FORMULA  determined from the fitted FORMULA . The local
susceptibility indicates the overall strength of the magnetic excitations for a given
energy.
FIGURE 
Fig. REF  summarizes the main findings of this work. Firstly, the magnetic
response is made up of two components [see Fig. REF (c)]: A low-frequency
(four-peaked) component for which FORMULA  is peaked around FORMULA  10 meV and a much broader high-frequency component which is strongest around FORMULA  120 meV. The spectral weight of the components are found to be FORMULA  and
FORMULA  FORMULA , the high energy component therefore dominating the
response. The emergence of the high-frequency component at FORMULA  80 meV corresponds
to a rapid broadening of FORMULA  in wavevector as shown
by the sudden increase in the FORMULA  parameter [Fig. REF (b)] at this
energy. Comparing the present results with a recent study {{cite:1cde0dde-be47-4e62-897c-ee2f00f87987}} of
optimally doped LaFORMULA SrFORMULA CuOFORMULA  over the same energy range [dashed line
is Fig. REF (c)], we note (i) The low-energy peak in
FORMULA  has moved from 18 meV down to about 10 meV with no change
in spectral weight {{cite:9d7c05ce-0575-4393-9378-950119697b1f}}. The low-energy IC component
[Fig. REF (a)] does not disperse rapidly towards FORMULA  as seen in
optimally doped LSCO {{cite:3675f18c-9d07-481c-bed9-1530ab31e115}}, {{cite:1cde0dde-be47-4e62-897c-ee2f00f87987}}. Instead the pattern disappears
rapidly. (ii) The peak in FORMULA  around 40-60 meV present in
LSCO(FORMULA =0.16), which corresponds to a strong response near FORMULA , is suppressed.
(iii) A high-energy (FORMULA  meV) component remains with approximately the same
amplitude as for LSCO(FORMULA =0.16). A recent study {{cite:89bc8706-0aa3-477c-a7c6-635009e85405}} of more highly doped
LSCO(FORMULA =0.25) reported significant spectral weight in the range 40-60 meV, although we
note that this work was performed with two FORMULA 's only, which may have limited the
ability to discriminate between scattering of a magnetic and phononic nature.
The origin of the magnetic excitations in the cuprates has been discussed in terms of
many models. As we move to the overdoped side of the phase diagram, it is widely believed
that Fermi-liquid-based models become more appropriate. Within such models, the
low-energy IC peaks arise from the creation of (correlated) quasiparticle pairs
{{cite:5fbad7de-1fd4-4fca-9d3e-47282c6e7689}}, {{cite:dc29ea8a-b666-483d-8c8c-d7e114fb57e2}}, {{cite:9205f12e-c622-4e07-8127-ba724e5ce295}}. Thus the shift of the low-energy peak in
FORMULA  to lower energy as we move from LSCO(FORMULA =0.16) to overdoped
LSCO(FORMULA =0.22) might be due to changes in the band structure. It is more difficult to
explain the sudden collapse of the magnetic response in the intermediate 50–70 meV
energy range between LSCO(FORMULA =0.16) and LSCO(FORMULA =0.22) [see Fig. REF (c)]
although photoemission (ARPES) suggests that the topology of the Fermi surface changes
between these two compositions as the quasiparticle states near FORMULA  move above the
Fermi energy {{cite:0f5b4388-cb5e-4594-b467-b1fda1077542}}. Thus, there will undoubtedly be a concomitant change in
the nesting of the quasiparticle states. At higher energies (80–160 meV), we observe the
reemergence of a magnetic signal which despite the heavy doping is about 1/3 of the
intensity of the parent antiferromagnet LaFORMULA CuOFORMULA  {{cite:d3354950-84f9-48df-bed3-7f4b821c5b45}} in the same
energy range. If we associate the high-energy response with residual antiferromagnetic
interactions, we find from the dispersion of the high-energy excitations
[Fig. REF (a)] FORMULA = FORMULA  meV r.l.u.FORMULA  that FORMULA  meV. Thus a strong AF exchange coupling persists across the cuprate phase
diagram into the overdoped region.
It is interesting to compare our measurements with electronic spectroscopies. ARPES
experiments {{cite:590dfd90-be68-4bb0-a381-4663db10f425}}, {{cite:777f3ef3-7194-4593-b22f-398290767eb9}}, {{cite:1805cf3a-0a1b-4a8c-8d3e-190d96bca79b}} have observed `kink' structures
in the quasiparticle dispersion of a number of systems including LSCO. These have been
interpreted as a signature of the coupling of quasiparticles to collective excitations
(bosons). In LSCO(FORMULA =0.22) a kink is observed {{cite:1805cf3a-0a1b-4a8c-8d3e-190d96bca79b}} at about 70 meV which
corresponds approximately to the onset of the higher-energy excitations that we have
observed. Recent APRES experiments {{cite:7e1ca2e1-4adf-4373-8e17-6dd1fff61119}}, {{cite:bdc21642-9fc0-4a31-897e-4249e5260e68}}, {{cite:37579f29-9a3c-43a2-ad18-bc21091db125}}, {{cite:1aa3c3db-8ac0-4497-990c-12c24f98d33e}}
indicate further quasiparticle anomalies at higher energies which persist into the
overdoped region {{cite:7e1ca2e1-4adf-4373-8e17-6dd1fff61119}}. These features could be related to high-energy spin
fluctuations which have been observed up to 250 meV for LSCO(FORMULA =0.14) {{cite:d3354950-84f9-48df-bed3-7f4b821c5b45}}
and up to 160 meV in the present measurement of LSCO(FORMULA =0.22). Infrared
optical-spectroscopy measurements {{cite:7528c4c5-845a-48a3-a30a-4fc1c6b1c169}} also provide evidence of the coupling
of quasiparticles to bosonic excitations and in particular the existence of a
two-component excitation spectrum with a high-energy tail.
In conclusion, overdoping dramatically suppresses the magnetic response. The remaining
spin excitations are incommensurate and persist over a wide energy range. Defining the
energy scale of the spin excitations as the `center of mass' of the observed spectrum,
the parent compound is an antiferromagnet with spin-wave excitations and an energy scale
FORMULA  FORMULA  meV. Doping results in stronger magnetic excitations at
intermediate energies, FORMULA  meV, for example, in optimally doped
LaFORMULA SrFORMULA CuOFORMULA  and a lower energy scale. The present experiment shows that
the energy scale increases as we move into the overdoped regime. Thus, the special
feature of the optimally doped region is the overall low characteristic energy of the
spin excitations and the drop in FORMULA  with overdoping is associated with the
disappearance of the commensurate response near 50 meV {{cite:1cde0dde-be47-4e62-897c-ee2f00f87987}}.
