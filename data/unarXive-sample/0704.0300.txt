We present an experimental investigation on the scaling of
resistance in individual single walled carbon nanotube devices with
channel lengths that vary four orders of magnitude on the same
sample. The electron mean free path is obtained from the linear
scaling of resistance with length at various temperatures. The low
temperature mean free path is determined by impurity scattering,
while at high temperature the mean free path decreases with
increasing temperature, indicating that it is limited by
electron-phonon scattering. An unusually long mean free path at room
temperature has been experimentally confirmed. Exponentially
increasing resistance with length at extremely long length scales
suggests anomalous localization effects.
Single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are 1D conductors that
exhibit a rich variety of low dimensional charge transport
phenomena {{cite:19d0b69d-f1ae-402a-97ac-e09c2ffda42d}}, including ballistic
conduction {{cite:682412f3-1ebf-4e42-b201-07e26c548efe}}, {{cite:d2e2bfac-1c65-4378-b520-328012badca7}}, {{cite:53309d73-71d8-485f-9013-69ec4fe2b5a4}}, {{cite:374cd816-ed56-403e-8160-f6e7604daf11}}, {{cite:15840079-c866-43dd-a2fd-6fe3b51f0843}},
localization {{cite:2167c5b1-5916-4fd2-a2a7-2eb0acd35eac}} and 1D variable range
hopping {{cite:6abd46c1-701a-4bb5-9050-c13d3d946aca}}. The electron mean free path, FORMULA , is one
of the important length scales that characterize the different 1D
transport regimes. One method of determining FORMULA  in SWNTs is to
measure ballistic conduction for a given device channel length.
However, this method yields a lower bound of FORMULA , and works only
at low temperature  {{cite:682412f3-1ebf-4e42-b201-07e26c548efe}}, {{cite:d2e2bfac-1c65-4378-b520-328012badca7}}, {{cite:53309d73-71d8-485f-9013-69ec4fe2b5a4}}, {{cite:374cd816-ed56-403e-8160-f6e7604daf11}} or at higher
temperature for small length scales (FORMULA 60 nm) {{cite:15840079-c866-43dd-a2fd-6fe3b51f0843}}.
Another approach to obtain FORMULA  at room temperature is to employ
scanning probe microscopy to measure the linear scaling of the
channel resistance {{cite:9fb08ac5-08d3-4045-833c-997dfcfc858b}}, or use non-invasive multi-terminal
measurements {{cite:97141d61-645d-4153-b676-64a4af6953c4}}. Due to the experimental limitations of
these approaches, the characterization of FORMULA  for the same SWNTs
over a range of temperatures is yet to be realized.
Recent advances in the growth of extremely long SWNTs (FORMULA 1 mm) {{cite:2a34b78e-05c7-4c80-8d27-8ef11675adc9}} now allow
for an intensive study on their intrinsic properties. In this letter, we present
experimental measurements on the scaling behavior of resistance in individual,
millimeter long SWNTs for the temperature range of 1.6 - 300 K. From the linear scaling
of resistance, the temperature dependent electron mean free path is calculated for
each temperature. Beyond the linear scaling regime, we observe that the resistance
increases exponentially with length, indicating localization behavior.
Macroscopically long and straight individual SWNTs were grown on a
degenerately doped Si/SiOFORMULA  substrate (FORMULA  500 nm) using
the chemical vapor deposition method described in Ref.{{cite:2a34b78e-05c7-4c80-8d27-8ef11675adc9}}.
This was followed by the fabrication of multiple Pd electrodes with
various separations (200 nm- 400 FORMULA m)(Fig. REF (a)). Pd
electrodes were chosen to create highly transparent SWNT-electrode
contacts {{cite:53309d73-71d8-485f-9013-69ec4fe2b5a4}}. The diameters of the SWNTs were measured by
atomic force microscope (AFM). We chose SWNTs with diameter
FORMULA  less than 2.5 nm to exclude any possibility of including multiwalled nanotubes (MWNT)
in this study. In addition, we confirmed that the high bias saturation current is
FORMULA  30 FORMULA A for all SWNTs studied {{cite:bf1e6082-ea85-4064-86e0-4d3dd20c8bea}}, assuring that the samples consisted
of single tubes rather than small bundles or MWNTs. The substrate was used as a gate
electrode to tune the chemical potential of the sample by the application of a gate
voltage FORMULA . A small dc source-drain bias voltage (FORMULA  10 mV), FORMULA , was applied
between pairs of consecutive electrodes, and the two-terminal linear response conductance
was determined from the measured source-drain current FORMULA .
FIGURE 
Fig. REF (b-c) shows the measured FORMULA  as a function of
FORMULA  for selected channel length sections on two
representative SWNTs. All curves exhibit a `gap' like feature - a
range of FORMULA  where FORMULA  is suppressed. On the same SWNT,
every device (pair of consecutive electrodes) shows a similar
FORMULA  up to a length-dependent multiplicative factor,
once we align the centers of the gap region for each curve. The
similarity of the FORMULA  behavior in different sections
for each SWNT sample indicates that the corresponding `gap'
features are derived from the intrinsic electronic structure of
the SWNT rather than the effects of random local variation.
TABLE 
We use the qualitatively different FORMULA  behaviors of
different SWNTs to categorize them as metallic (M-NT) or
semiconducting nanotubes (S-NT). Typical S-NTs
(Fig. REF (c)) exhibit an off current region
FORMULA A when the Fermi energy FORMULA  lies n the energy
gap  {{cite:a7c5316d-0c9d-4b02-ab56-ce3d6b296bce}}, {{cite:2b44b880-b84a-4db0-93f6-208427150d35}}. On the other hand, a weaker
suppression of FORMULA  is observed in the `small gap'
region in M-NTs (Fig. REF (b)). The `small gap' in M-NTs has
been attributed to the curvature-induced energy gap
FORMULA 100 meV {{cite:3a25d5d5-1982-46b5-8328-351864188927}}, which is distinguished from the
S-NT energy gap, which scales with diameter as
FORMULA  1/FORMULA  (nm) {{cite:19d0b69d-f1ae-402a-97ac-e09c2ffda42d}}. Among the 11 SWNTs we
studied in this letter, we found 4 M-NTs and 7 S-NTs. Each of
these SWNTs exhibit a gap centered at FORMULA , indicating their
FORMULA -doped nature. At large negative gate voltage (FORMULA  V),
FORMULA  lies well outside of the gap region and FORMULA 
saturates to FORMULA , whose value depends only on the
applied FORMULA  and channel length FORMULA  of the SWNT section. The
two-terminal resistance of the SWNT section is then obtained from
FORMULA . We note that four-terminal resistance
measurements are possible for each section by utilizing the
available multiple electrode configuration. However, in our
experiment, the four terminal measurements yield essentially
similar results to the two terminal FORMULA , which prevents
separation of the `contact' resistance contribution from FORMULA .
Such inseparable contact resistance between SWNT-metal electrodes
was reported to be caused by the invasiveness of metal
contacts {{cite:599c24bc-a48b-463b-8e93-25a92b7e27c8}}.
FIGURE 
We designed many pairs of electrodes with different FORMULA  on each
SWNT so that the scaling of FORMULA  can be studied for a specific
sample at a given temperature FORMULA . Fig. REF (a) show FORMULA 
of a representative SWNT measured in the temperature range of
1.6 - 300 K and with an FORMULA  range of 200 nm - 50 FORMULA m. In these
ranges, FORMULA  increases linearly and appears to converge to a
finite value for small FORMULA  (inset to Fig. REF (a)). We found
that this scaling behavior can be described well by a simple
linear dependence with an offset: FORMULA , where
FORMULA  and FORMULA  are interpreted as the 1D resistivity and
contact resistance, respectively. The solid lines in
Fig. REF (a) are the two parameter line fits of the data
points at a given FORMULA  value. From these fits, FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are obtained as shown in Fig. REF (b) and
Fig. REF (c), respectively. For this sample, FORMULA  remains
fairly constant at FORMULA 8 kFORMULA  and FORMULA  exhibits
typical metallic behavior, i.e. it decreases with FORMULA  and
saturates to a value FORMULA  at low temperatures. Similar
scaling behavior of FORMULA  is observed in other SWNTs, from which
both FORMULA  and FORMULA  are extracted within the linear scaling
regime. Table  REF  summarizes FORMULA , FORMULA , and
FORMULA  for the 4 M-NTs and 7 S-NTs considered in this study.
To understand the scaling of FORMULA  in Fig. REF , we begin
with the two-terminal Landauer-Buttiker formula applied to
SWNTs {{cite:9fb08ac5-08d3-4045-833c-997dfcfc858b}}. If we consider 4 low-energy channels in the
SWNT, 2 each for spin and band degeneracy, then the scaling of
resistance is given by FORMULA , where
FORMULA  and FORMULA  are electron charge and Plank constant and FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are the electron mean free path and the non-transparent
contact resistance, respectively. Note that we separate out the
contribution of FORMULA  from the total contact resistance
FORMULA , so that the contact resistance becomes the quantum
resistance FORMULA  when the contacts become fully
transparent. From the experimentally obtained FORMULA  and
FORMULA , we can deduce FORMULA  and FORMULA  for each of our SWNT samples. In particular, we note that
FORMULA  for the majority of our samples, suggesting
that the barrier at the contacts is very thin and adds only a
negligible contribution when FORMULA  becomes substantially large.
FIGURE 
We now discuss the temperature dependent behavior of the mean free
path. Fig. REF  is the central result of this letter,
showing FORMULA  of the SWNTs listed in Table REF .
Overall, FORMULA  exhibits different behaviors in two regimes
separated by FORMULA : (i) the high temperature regime
(FORMULA ) where FORMULA  (dashed line in
Fig. REF ), which indicates that inelastic scattering
between electrons and acoustic phonons is dominant {{cite:9fb08ac5-08d3-4045-833c-997dfcfc858b}}, {{cite:6a2d8d1b-026a-48f9-a2ca-45b8696349da}} regardless of chirality {{cite:a313773f-b65f-4095-9cc2-82980e41360f}}; and (ii) the low
temperature regime FORMULA  where FORMULA  saturates to the the
tube specific FORMULA . In this low temperature limit, the
phonons freeze out and FORMULA  is determined by the
temperature independent elastic scattering with impurities. We
believe the widely spread FORMULA  values (0.4-10FORMULA m) in
(ii) are a result of each SWNT sample having a static disorder of
different strengths and densities. We employ scanning gate
microscopy (SGM) {{cite:4403b0df-94ed-43c3-b6f1-3336a980d063}} to image this static disorder.
Indeed, the SGM images on S-NTs (insets to Fig. REF ) reveal
that the SWNT with a shorter FORMULA  shows more defects.
Note also that we have experimentally confirmed that FORMULA  is
generally much higher for M-NTs than that of S-NTs. This is an
indication that the scattering of electrons is strongly suppressed
in M-NTs, as predicted by Ando et al. {{cite:ef5c6d9e-f00f-46a9-bb10-ed665dc07e38}} and McEuen et
al. {{cite:a848b69c-117d-4a9b-a2d3-ecda6e8b6865}}. In M-NTs we have experimentally shown that
the ballistic electron conduction is possible for channel lengths
up to 8 FORMULA m at low temperature and 0.8 FORMULA m even at room
temperature.
FIGURE 
Finally, we turn our attention to the non-linear scaling of
FORMULA . Fig. REF  presents FORMULA  beyond the linear scaling
regime of a representative S-NT and M-NT. At extremely long length
scales and low temperatures, FORMULA  deviates from the linear
dependence extended from the linear regime (dashed lines in main
figure and see also FORMULA  in lower
insets). Since FORMULA  for all temperatures,
we emphasize here that this non-linear behavior in FORMULA  is
solely due to increasing electron scattering in the bulk part of
the SWNTs rather than an increasing barrier between the SWNT and
electrodes. In order to experimentally determine the critical
length scale FORMULA  beyond which the non-linear behaviors is
dominant, we use a phenomenological equation:
FORMULA  to fit the data (solid
curves in Fig. REF ). While FORMULA  shows a strong sample
dependent behavior, generally we found FORMULA  in all
temperature ranges, with the temperature dependence exhibiting a
trend of increasing FORMULA  with increasing FORMULA (upper insets to
Fig. REF ). This observed behavior of FORMULA  excludes
the quantum interference related to strong localization effects
such as Anderson Localization {{cite:2167c5b1-5916-4fd2-a2a7-2eb0acd35eac}} from the possible
scenarios. In particular, in the high temperature regime
FORMULA , the phase coherence length FORMULA  is limited by
the phase-breaking electron-phonon scattering, and thus
FORMULA , inviting further study to elucidate
the observed localization behavior beyond the strong localization
limit {{cite:ef5ec406-88cc-4524-adca-fa7a0f9937ce}}, {{cite:52d6f9bf-7c82-4065-a995-e4483e00e7cc}}.
In conclusion, we determine the length dependent resistance for
SWNTs with channel lengths ranged 200 nm - 400FORMULA m. From the
scaling behavior we evaluate the electron mean free path and
localization length of the SWNT for a range of temperatures. While
the low temperature mean free path is determined by the impurity
scattering, an unusually long mean free path is demonstrated at room
temperature, even with the dominant electron-phonon scattering.
