Introduction
This paper is devoted to
pseudodifferential operators with symbols of limited regularity. The
author
{{cite:92292ed2-47ee-4be0-86d3-fabe879ec59b}} introduced the space of
symbols FORMULA  on the phase space FORMULA 
with the property that
FORMULA 
for some FORMULA  function FORMULA  on FORMULA . Here the hat
indicates that we take the Fourier transform, FORMULA  is a
lattice and FORMULA  form a partition of
unity, FORMULA , FORMULA . A. Boulkhemair {{cite:11c746b0-96a5-49e0-a6d8-30bafaa8c605}} noticed that this space is identical
to a space that he had defined differently in {{cite:a1c54d4e-17a5-4caf-bc57-be0f553a16ef}}.
It was shown among other things that this space of symbols is an
algebra for the ordinary multiplication and that this fact persists
after quantization, namely the corresponding pseudodifferential
operators (say under Weyl quantization) form a non-commutative
algebra: If FORMULA  belong to the class above with corresponding
FORMULA  functions FORMULA  and FORMULA  then FORMULA  where
FORMULA  belongs to the same class and as a correponding function we may
take FORMULA  for any FORMULA . Here FORMULA  indicates
convolution and FORMULA  is
the Weyl quantization of the symbol FORMULA , given by
FORMULA 
The definition (REF ) is
independent of the choice of lattice and the corresponding function
FORMULA . When passing to a different choice, we may have to change
the function FORMULA  to
FORMULA  for any fixed FORMULA . We
then gain the fact that the weight FORMULA  is an order function in the
sense that
FORMULA 
(See {{cite:a2c33833-27af-45f9-a183-1d0b3353adf2}} where this notion is used for developing a fairly
simple calculus of semi-classical pseudodifferential operators,
basically a special case of Hörmander's Weyl calculus {{cite:87197aa9-12b2-48ed-bf6c-28729b4e364b}}.)
The space of functions in (REF ) is a special case of the
modulation spaces of H.G. Feichtinger (see {{cite:a7824016-cfff-4584-8d3a-478d7104ff96}}, {{cite:1f0ed471-2cd8-40e4-9feb-0f4560648bef}}), and the
relations between these spaces and pseudodifferential operators have
been developed by many authors; K. Gröchenig {{cite:6c2936b3-abe4-44a1-adbd-ec72a4f677e6}}, {{cite:11caaeb8-8f0c-4d38-9658-8035cc9d12ce}}, Gröchenig, T. Strohmer {{cite:81c02c75-fa50-44a2-91d2-44d9cf36369b}}, K. Tachigawa {{cite:0cad7040-3053-4b92-b968-1bb729d5749f}},
J. Toft {{cite:c5300102-5d39-4026-b12f-80624efbe61d}}, A. Holst, J. Toft, P. Wahlberg {{cite:0a9e52fa-c8d4-4103-859f-681b2131212c}}.
Here we could mention that
Boulkhemair {{cite:796cd9d5-ab6a-4541-bbd6-d60ec782f52f}} proved FORMULA -continuity for Fourier integral
operators with symbols and phases in the original spaces of the type
(REF ), that T. Strohmer {{cite:7c5c8b76-bab6-423c-9c06-2371d05838f7}} has applied the theory to
problems in mobile communications and that Y. Morimoto and N. Lerner
{{cite:3951f4b9-64b2-4044-936f-a5f643a088cd}} have used the original space to prove a version of the
Fefferman-Phong inequality for pseudodifferential operators with
symbols of low regularity. This result was recently improved by
Boulkhemair {{cite:116d8f95-1127-479d-b058-c5b91a36c2aa}}.
Closely related works on pseudodifferential - and Fourier - integral
operators with symbols of limited regularity include the works
of Boulkhemair
{{cite:e9437bf4-940d-4f27-9763-9193760a75e5}}, {{cite:64830204-c07a-4d78-83f4-56643bad5a65}}, and many others also contain a study of when such
operators or related Gabor localization operators belong to to
Schatten-von Neumann classes: E. Cordero, Gröchenig {{cite:113321b2-0b77-4f85-a26f-a2dfa9897191}}, {{cite:48c04e1f-2731-4a61-8c0f-983302e176d5}}, C. Heil, J. Ramanathan, P. Topiwala
{{cite:525a86db-352b-4e5d-85c3-95fde137be15}}, Heil {{cite:de79b80a-491c-4bfa-b734-7b556c1f75ab}}, J. Toft {{cite:65eea714-14d7-4a77-a97d-b2ebc92655e1}}, and M.W. Wong {{cite:c2979305-beb6-4ce5-83df-1e8bc7d7f820}}.
The present work has been stimulated by these developments and the
prospect of using “modulation type weights” to get more flexibility
in the calculus of pseudodifferential operators with limited
regularity. In the back of our head there were also some very
stimulating discussions with J.M. Bony and N. Lerner from the time of
the writing of {{cite:92292ed2-47ee-4be0-86d3-fabe879ec59b}}, {{cite:9bd2d350-92bb-43d6-9862-f737de16786e}} and at that time Bony explained to the
author a
nice very general point of view of A. Unterberger {{cite:eb23a92c-cd50-4487-b7ee-73a7a7704840}}
for a direct microlocal analysis of very general
classes of operators. Bony used it in his
work {{cite:3a23a9eb-ccc5-4765-9473-106b2d1648e1}} and showed how his approach could be
applied to recover and generalize the space
in {{cite:92292ed2-47ee-4be0-86d3-fabe879ec59b}}. However, the aim of the work {{cite:3a23a9eb-ccc5-4765-9473-106b2d1648e1}} was to develop
a very general theory of Fourier integral operators related to
symplectic metrics of Hörmander's Weyl calculus of
pseudodifferential operators, and the relation with {{cite:92292ed2-47ee-4be0-86d3-fabe879ec59b}} was
explained very briefly. See {{cite:abe64d66-5ff9-4bd1-b823-ad69aced7de9}} for even more
general classes of Fourier integral operators.
In the present paper we make a direct generalization of the spaces of {{cite:92292ed2-47ee-4be0-86d3-fabe879ec59b}}.
Instead of using order functions only depending on FORMULA  we can now allow arbitrary order
functions FORMULA . See Definition REF  below. In Proposition
REF  we show that this definition gives back the spaces above
when the weight FORMULA  is an order function of FORMULA  only.
In Section  we consider the quantization of our symbols
and show how to define
an associated effective kernel on FORMULA , FORMULA , which is
FORMULA  where FORMULA 
and FORMULA  is the natural Hamilton map induced by the symplectic
structure.
We show that if the effective kernel is the kernel of a bounded operator
: FORMULA  then our pseudodifferential operator is bounded in
FORMULA . In particular if FORMULA  only depends on FORMULA , we recover
the FORMULA -boundedness when FORMULA  is integrable. This result was obtained previously by
Bony {{cite:3a23a9eb-ccc5-4765-9473-106b2d1648e1}}, but our approach is rather different.
In Section  we study the composition of pseudodifferential
operators in our classes. If FORMULA  are symbols associated
to the order functions FORMULA , FORMULA , then the Weyl composition is a
well defined symbol associated to the order function FORMULA  given
in (), provided that the integral there converges for at least
one value of FORMULA  (and then automatically for all other values by
Proposition ). This statement is equivalent to the corresponding
natural one for the effective kernels, namely the composition is well
defined if the composition of the majorant kernels
FORMULA 
and FORMULA  is well-defined, see (REF ),
(REF ).
In Section  we simplify the results further (for those readers
who are familiar with Bargmann transforms from the FBI - complex Fourier
integral operator point of view).
In Section  we use the same point
of view to give a simple sufficient condition on the order function FORMULA 
and the index FORMULA , for the quantization FORMULA  to
belong to the Schatten–von Neumann class FORMULA 
for every symbol
FORMULA  belonging to the symbol class with weight FORMULA . See {{cite:65eea714-14d7-4a77-a97d-b2ebc92655e1}}, {{cite:3f84a2ee-97a3-469f-a425-d9fc945b9d0c}}, {{cite:0a9e52fa-c8d4-4103-859f-681b2131212c}}, {{cite:608c50f0-d8a0-4f0b-b422-9f026bb427c0}}, {{cite:3b7b72ba-d11b-4038-9c8e-1b50f2fe58c7}} for related results and ideas.
In Section  we finally generalize our results by replacing
the underlying space FORMULA  on certain lattices by more general
translation invariant Banach spaces. We believe that this generalization
allows to
include modulation spaces, but we have contented ourselves by establishing
results allowing to go from properties on the level of lattices to the
level of
pseudodifferential operators. The results could undoubtedly be even further
generalized. In this section and the preceding one, we have been inspired by
the use of lattices and amalgan spaces in time frequency analysis,
in particular by the work of Gröchenig and Strohmer {{cite:81c02c75-fa50-44a2-91d2-44d9cf36369b}} that
uses previous results by Fournier–Stewart {{cite:31c6282d-f256-4d62-892d-e6f970c281e3}} and Feichtinger
{{cite:d2e654d7-a578-40b3-9191-7847b5c07cf1}}.
We have chosen to work with the Weyl quantization, but it is clear
that the results
carry over with the obvious modifications to other quantizations like the
Kohn-Nirenberg one, actually for the general symbol-spaces under consideration
the results could also have been formulatated directly for classes of integral
operators.
Similar ideas and results have been obtained in many other
works,
out of
which some are cited above and later in the text.

Symbol spaces
Let FORMULA  be a FORMULA -dimensional real vector space. We say that
FORMULA  is an order function on FORMULA  if there exist
constants FORMULA , FORMULA , such that
FORMULA 
Here FORMULA 
and FORMULA  is a norm on FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be as above, let FORMULA  be the dual space and let FORMULA  be a
lattice in FORMULA , so that FORMULA  where FORMULA  is a basis in FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  have the property that
FORMULA 
Let FORMULA  be an order function on FORMULA , FORMULA .
Definition 2.1 We say that FORMULA 
if there is a constant FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  denotes the Weyl quantization of FORMULA . The norm will always be the the one in
FORMULA  if nothing else is indicated.

To define the FORMULA -norm we need to choose a Lebesgue measure on FORMULA , but
clearly that can only affect the choice of the constant in (REF ).
Proposition 2.2  FORMULA  is a Banach space with
FORMULA  equal to the smallest possible
constant in
(REF ). Changing FORMULA , FORMULA  and replacing the FORMULA  norm by
the FORMULA -norm
for any FORMULA  in the above definition, gives rise to the same
space with an equivalent norm.

Proof  The Banach space property will follow from the other arguments
so we do not treat it explicitly. Let FORMULA  be as in Definition
REF .
Let FORMULA  be another lattice and let FORMULA 
be another function with the same properties as FORMULA . We have to show that
FORMULA 
Lemma 2.3 
FORMULA  such that FORMULA , where FORMULA .

Proof 
Let FORMULA  be equal to 1 near FORMULA ,
and put FORMULA . Then FORMULA  in FORMULA , when FORMULA , so for FORMULA  small enough,
FORMULA 
has a bounded inverse in FORMULA . Here FORMULA  is the space of
all FORMULA  that are bounded with all their
derivatives. By a version of the Beals lemma
(see for instance {{cite:a2c33833-27af-45f9-a183-1d0b3353adf2}}), we then know that the inverse is of the form
FORMULA  where FORMULA .
Also FORMULA , FORMULA . Put FORMULA  for FORMULA  small
enough and fixed, so that FORMULA ,
FORMULA  (using for instance the simple pseudodifferential
calculus in {{cite:a2c33833-27af-45f9-a183-1d0b3353adf2}}). Then FORMULA .
 FORMULA

Now, write
FORMULA 
Here (using for instance {{cite:a2c33833-27af-45f9-a183-1d0b3353adf2}})
FORMULA 
Hence, if FORMULA  is large enough,
FORMULA 
Conversely, if FORMULA , FORMULA , we see that by the same arguments that FORMULA , FORMULA .
 FORMULA

Next, we check that this is essentially a generalization of a space introduced
by Sjöstrand {{cite:92292ed2-47ee-4be0-86d3-fabe879ec59b}} and independently and in a different way by
Boukhemair {{cite:a1c54d4e-17a5-4caf-bc57-be0f553a16ef}}. It is a
special case of more general modulation spaces (see {{cite:a7824016-cfff-4584-8d3a-478d7104ff96}}, {{cite:1f0ed471-2cd8-40e4-9feb-0f4560648bef}}).
That follows from the next result if we take an order function FORMULA 
independent of
FORMULA .
Proposition 2.4 
Let FORMULA  be an order function on FORMULA 
and let FORMULA , FORMULA ,
where FORMULA  is a lattice and
FORMULA . Then
FORMULA 

Proof 
Let FORMULA  be a lattice and choose FORMULA ,
such that
FORMULA , where FORMULA . If FORMULA  belongs to
the set in the right hand side of (REF ), then by Parseval's relation,
FORMULA 
Now FORMULA , where
FORMULA ,
FORMULA , FORMULA ,
so FORMULA . Conversely, if FORMULA ,
we get (REF ). According to Proposition REF , we can replace
the FORMULA  norm by any FORMULA  norm, and the proof shows that we can
equally well replace the FORMULA  norm that of
FORMULA . Taking FORMULA , we get
FORMULA 
and since FORMULA  is an order function, we deduce that FORMULA  belongs to
the set in the right hand side of (REF ).
 FORMULA


Effective kernels and FORMULA -boundedness
A closely related notion for effective kernels in terms of short time Fourier
transforms has been introduced by Gröchenig and Heil {{cite:608c50f0-d8a0-4f0b-b422-9f026bb427c0}}.
We now take FORMULA . If FORMULA , we let
FORMULA 
denote the Weyl composition so that FORMULA . Here
FORMULA  where
we write FORMULA , FORMULA  instead of FORMULA , FORMULA  whenever convenient.
We know that the Weyl composition is still well-defined when FORMULA  belong to
various symbol spaces like
FORMULA 
when FORMULA  is an order function on FORMULA . (See Example REF  below for a
straight forward generalization.)
Let FORMULA  be a linear form on FORMULA  and let FORMULA  be a symbol. Then,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  (with “FORMULA ”) is the Hamilton field of FORMULA . Similarly,
FORMULA 
From (REF ), (REF ), we get
FORMULA 
where we notice that FORMULA , and
FORMULA 
if FORMULA  is a second linear form on FORMULA .
If FORMULA  is fixed, we may consider that FORMULA  is concentrated near
FORMULA . Then we say that FORMULA  is concentrated
near FORMULA . Conversely, if FORMULA  is concentrated near a
point FORMULA , we let FORMULA  be the unique
vector with FORMULA  and write
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is concentrated near FORMULA .
To make this more precise, let (as in {{cite:4588ce05-42ec-44bf-8e3f-f30ad6d9e4a8}})
FORMULA 
be a generalized Bargmann transform where FORMULA  is a quadratic form on
FORMULA  with FORMULA , FORMULA ,
and with FORMULA  suitably chosen, so
that FORMULA  is unitary FORMULA , where FORMULA  denotes the Lebesgue
measure on FORMULA  and FORMULA  is the strictly plurisubharmonic quadratic form given by
FORMULA 
We know ({{cite:4588ce05-42ec-44bf-8e3f-f30ad6d9e4a8}}) that if FORMULA , then
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
is the linear canonical transformation associated to FORMULA . Here FORMULA , following standard conventions in
complex analysis.
If FORMULA  we have an exact version of Egorov's theorem, saying
that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is given by
FORMULA . In {{cite:4588ce05-42ec-44bf-8e3f-f30ad6d9e4a8}} it is dicussed how to define
and estimate the Weyl quantization of symbols on the Bargmann transform side,
by means of almost holomorphic extensions and contour deformations. We retain from
the proof of Proposition 1.2 in that paper that
FORMULA 
where the kernel is non-unique but can be chosen to satisfy
FORMULA 
for every FORMULA . (This immediately implies the Calderón-Vaillancourt
theorem for the class FORMULA .)
If FORMULA , then for every  FORMULA
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  are seminorms in FORMULA .
Identifying FORMULA  with FORMULA , we can view FORMULA  as a function
FORMULA  on FORMULA  and (REF ) becomes
FORMULA 
Now, let FORMULA  in (REF ) be concentrated near
FORMULA  with FORMULA , where we let
FORMULA  be the map FORMULA  (and we shall prefer to write
FORMULA  when we do not think of this quantity as a constant coefficient vector
field). Then by (REF )–(REF ), we have
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
Now it is wellknown that if FORMULA  then
FORMULA  is a unitary operator that can be viewed
as a quantization of the phase space
translation FORMULA . On the Bargmann transform side
these quantizations can be explicitly represented as magnetic translations,
i.e. translations made unitary by multiplication by certain weights. In fact,
let FORMULA  be a linear form on
FORMULA  which is real on FORMULA , so that
FORMULA 
By essentially the same calculation as in the real setting, we see that
FORMULA 
and here we recall from the unitary and metaplectic equivalence with
FORMULA  (via FORMULA ) that FORMULA  is unitary, or equivalently that
FORMULA 
(A simple calculation shows more directly the equivalence of (REF ) and
(REF ).) Notice also that if we identify FORMULA  with a function
FORMULA  on
FORMULA  via the natural projection FORMULA , then
FORMULA  is identified with FORMULA , where the
Hamilton field FORMULA  is viewed as a real constant vector field
on FORMULA .
It follows that FORMULA  has a kernel satisfying
FORMULA 
and from (REF ) we get
FORMULA 
so the kernel of FORMULA  is concentrated near FORMULA .
Now, let FORMULA  be an order function on FORMULA  and let FORMULA . Choose a lattice FORMULA  and a
partition of unity as in (REF ) as well as a function
FORMULA  as in Lemma REF . Write
FORMULA 
where FORMULA . Then, using that
FORMULA  is continuous: FORMULA , we see that
FORMULA  is
concentrated near FORMULA  in the above sense and more precisely,
FORMULA 
where we write FORMULA .
Let FORMULA ,
so that
FORMULA 
and hence
FORMULA 
so (REF ) implies
FORMULA 
where we used that FORMULA  is an order function in the last inequality. Choose FORMULA 
with FORMULA , sum over FORMULA  and use (REF ) to get
FORMULA 
We get
Theorem 3.1 
Let FORMULA , where FORMULA  is an order function on FORMULA , FORMULA . Then FORMULA  has an effective kernel (rigorously defined
after applying a Bargmann transform as above) satisfying (REF ), where
FORMULA  is a FORMULA  norm of FORMULA . In particular, if FORMULA  is the kernel of an FORMULA -bounded operator,
then FORMULA  is bounded: FORMULA .

As mentioned in the introduction, the statement on FORMULA -boundedness
here is due to
Bony {{cite:3a23a9eb-ccc5-4765-9473-106b2d1648e1}}, who obtained it in a rather different way. A
calculation, similar to the one leading to (REF ), has been given by
Gröchenig {{cite:6c2936b3-abe4-44a1-adbd-ec72a4f677e6}}.
Corollary 3.2 
If FORMULA  is the kernel of a Shur class operator i.e. if
FORMULA 
then FORMULA  is bounded: FORMULA .

Corollary 3.3 
Assume FORMULA  is independent of FORMULA , for FORMULA  and FORMULA , then
FORMULA  is bounded: FORMULA .


Composition
Let FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  and consider the Weyl composition of the two symbols
FORMULA , FORMULA  , concentrated near
FORMULA  and
FORMULA  respectively:
FORMULA 
We work in canonical coordinates FORMULA  and identify FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Then
FORMULA 
and FORMULA  is convolution with FORMULA , given by
FORMULA 
The phase FORMULA  has a unique nondegenerate critical point FORMULA  and the corresponding critical value is equal to FORMULA . Hence
FORMULA  for some (known) constant FORMULA .
The composition (REF ) becomes
FORMULA 
The exponent in the last integral can be rewritten as
FORMULA 
and the composition (REF ) takes the form
FORMULA , where
FORMULA 
Since FORMULA  is a nondegenerate quadratic form, we have for every FORMULA 
by integration by parts,
FORMULA 
Hence for every FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
Using the triangle inequality, we get
FORMULA 
so
FORMULA 
and hence for every FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
Clearly, we have the same estimates for the derivatives of FORMULA . It follows that the composition (REF ) is equal to FORMULA , where
FORMULA 
and where FORMULA  and for every seminorm FORMULA  on FORMULA  and every
FORMULA , there is a seminorm FORMULA  on FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
It follows that :
FORMULA 
with corresponding norm bounded by
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA  where FORMULA  are suitable seminorms on FORMULA .
If FORMULA , FORMULA  then
FORMULA  is
well-defined and belongs to FORMULA  provided that the
integrals defining FORMULA  and FORMULA  below converge. Here (replacing
summation over lattices by integration)
FORMULA 
In order to understand the integral (REF ), we put
FORMULA , FORMULA ,
FORMULA , and study the set FORMULA  where the
arguments inside the three brackets vanish simultaneously:
FORMULA 
From the above discussion, we get
Theorem 4.1 
Let FORMULA , FORMULA  be order functions on FORMULA  and define FORMULA  by (). Assume that FORMULA  is finite for at least one FORMULA  so that
FORMULA  is a well-defined order function by Proposition . Then the
composition map
FORMULA 
has a bilinear extension
FORMULA 
Moreover,
FORMULA 

We end this section by establishing a connection with the effective
kernels of Section . Let FORMULA  be as in the theorem with
FORMULA . According to Theorem REF , we then know that FORMULA 
has an effective kernel FORMULA  satisfying
FORMULA 
Since the composition of the effective kernels of FORMULA  and FORMULA  is an
effective kernel for FORMULA  we expect that
FORMULA 
or more explicitly,
FORMULA 
Writing
FORMULA 
we check that the integral in (REF ) coincides with the one in ()
up to a constant Jacobian factor, so the results of this section fit
with the ones of Section .
Example 4.2 Let FORMULA , FORMULA , where FORMULA  are order functions on FORMULA  of the form
FORMULA 
Then, the effective kernels FORMULA  of FORMULA  satisfy
FORMULA 
Then FORMULA  is well-defined and belongs to FORMULA , where
FORMULA 
provided that the last integral converges for at least one (and then all)
value(s) of FORMULA . If we use that
FORMULA 
we get
FORMULA 
Thus FORMULA  and FORMULA  are well-defined if
FORMULA 
The integral FORMULA  in (REF ) is FORMULA  in any region where
FORMULA . For FORMULA , we write
FORMULA , where

FORMULA  is the integral over FORMULA . Here FORMULA .

FORMULA  is the integral over FORMULA . Here FORMULA .

FORMULA  is the integral over FORMULA . Here FORMULA .

We get
FORMULA 
with the convention that we tacitly add a factor FORMULA 
when the expression inside FORMULA  is equal to 0. Similarly (with the
same convention),
FORMULA 
In view of (REF ), we have
FORMULA 
it follows that
FORMULA 
so with the same convention, we have
FORMULA 
This simplifies to
FORMULA 
if we strengthen the assumption (REF ) to:
FORMULA 


More direct approach using Bargmann transforms
By using Bargmann transforms more systematically (from the point of
view of Fourier integral operators with complex
phase) the results of Section ,  can be obtained more directly.
The price to pay however, is the loss of some aspects that might be
helpful in other situations like the ones with variable metrics.
Let FORMULA  be real FORMULA -dimensional space as in Section  and
define FORMULA  as in (REF )–(REF ). Then
we have
Proposition 5.1 
If FORMULA  is an order function on FORMULA , then
FORMULA 
where the best constant FORMULA  is a norm on FORMULA .

Proof 
Assume first that FORMULA  belongs to FORMULA  and write
FORMULA  as in Lemma REF .
The effective kernel of FORMULA  satisfies
FORMULA 
for every FORMULA , where throughout the proof we identify FORMULA  with
FORMULA  by means of FORMULA  and work on the latter space.
Here FORMULA  is the natural projection.
Then we see that
FORMULA 
Conversely, if FORMULA , then since the effective
kernel of FORMULA  also satisfies (REF ), we see that
FORMULA ,
implying FORMULA , and
hence FORMULA 
 FORMULA

With this in mind, we now take FORMULA  and look for an explicit choice of effective kernel for
FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be a Bargmann transform as above. Consider first the map FORMULA  from FORMULA  to the distribution kernel of FORMULA , given by
FORMULA 
We view this as a Fourier integral operator FORMULA  with
quadratic phase. The associated linear canonical transformation is given by:
FORMULA 
which we can write as
FORMULA 
From the unitarity of FORMULA , we know that FORMULA , where
FORMULA 
We can therefore define the effective kernel of FORMULA  to be
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
We write this as
FORMULA 
with FORMULA , so
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
We see that FORMULA  is
a unitary Bargmann transform, where
FORMULA 
The canonical transformation associated to FORMULA  is
FORMULA 
If
FORMULA 
we check that
FORMULA 
Clearly FORMULA  is a Bargmann transform
with associated canonical transformation FORMULA ,
so in view of (REF ) the map FORMULA  is also a Bargmann
transform with associated canonical
transformation
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .
The restriction to the real phase space is
FORMULA 
and this restriction determines our complex linear canonical
transformation uniquely.
As in Section  we may view the effective kernel
FORMULA 
in (REF ) as a function on FORMULA , by identifying FORMULA 
with FORMULA  respectively. With this
identification and using also the general characterization in (REF ) (with
FORMULA  replaced by FORMULA ),
we see that if FORMULA , then FORMULA  iff
FORMULA 
where we shortened the notation by writing FORMULA  instead of FORMULA  and FORMULA 
instead of FORMULA .
Theorem REF  now follows from (REF ), (REF ), (REF ).
Theorem REF  also follows from (REF ), (REF ), (REF )
together with
the remark that the kernel FORMULA  is the unique kernel which is
holomorphic on FORMULA ,
such that the corresponding FORMULA  given in (REF ) is of
temperate growth at infinity and (REF )
is fulfilled. Indeed, then it is clear that
FORMULA 
and the bound (REF ) for FORMULA  with FORMULA  follows directly from the corresponding bounds for FORMULA  with FORMULA .

FORMULA  classes
In this section we give a simple condition on an order function FORMULA 
on FORMULA  (FORMULA ) and
a number FORMULA  that implies the property:
FORMULA 
Here FORMULA  is the Schatten–von Neumann class of operators: FORMULA , see for instance {{cite:4516d229-2d53-4bb7-8190-303dfd280afb}}.
Let FORMULA  be an order function on FORMULA  and let FORMULA .
Consider the following property, where FORMULA  is given in (REF ) and
FORMULA  is a lattice,
FORMULA 
Notice that if (REF ) holds and if we fix some number
FORMULA , then
if FORMULA 
is a block matrix where every FORMULA  is an FORMULA 
matrix then
FORMULA 
Proposition 6.1 
The property (REF ) only depends on FORMULA  but not on the choice of FORMULA .

Proof 
Let FORMULA  satisfy (REF ) and let FORMULA  be a
second lattice in FORMULA . Let FORMULA 
be a FORMULA  matrix satisfying
FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be a point that realizes the
distance from FORMULA  to FORMULA , so that
FORMULA  for
some constant FORMULA . Let FORMULA  and choose an
enumeration FORMULA , FORMULA , for
every FORMULA .
Then we can identify FORMULA  with the matrix
FORMULA  where
FORMULA  is the FORMULA  matrix with the entries
FORMULA 
S(m)FORMULA K(x,y)FORMULA CpFORMULA A:L2(e-2L(dx))L2(e-2L(dx)) FORMULA FORMULAFORMULA Aeff:L2(Cn)L2(Cn)FORMULA KeffFORMULA Keff(x,y)=O(1)m(q (x,y)) FORMULACnFORMULA T*RnFORMULA xTFORMULA K(x,y)=O(1)m(q (x,y))e(x)+(y) FORMULA
For FORMULA  we have (identifying FORMULA  with a lattice in FORMULA )
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
is holomorphic with
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
Here we identify FORMULA  with their images
FORMULA  respectively. In fact, the case FORMULA  is clear and we get the extension to
arbitrary FORMULA  from the Cauchy inequalities, since
FORMULA 
is holomorphic.
We can also write
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
so
FORMULA 
Consider a partition of unity
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is open with smooth boundary. Let FORMULA , so that (REF ) holds for FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be defined by
FORMULA 
so that the adjoint of FORMULA  is given by
FORMULA 
Then FORMULA  and its adjoint are bounded operators and
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and
FORMULA , FORMULA  are given by the kernels
FORMULA  and FORMULA  respectively. It now suffices to show that
FORMULA 
belongs to FORMULA  with a norm
that is bounded by a constant times the FORMULA -norm of FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be an orthonormal basis of
eigenfunctions of minus the Dirichlet Laplacian in FORMULA , arranged
so that the corresponding eigenvalues form an increasing sequence. Then
FORMULA , FORMULA  form an orthonormal basis of
eigenfunctions of the corresponding operator in FORMULA .
From (REF ) it follows that the matrix elements FORMULA 
of FORMULA  with respect to the bases FORMULA 
and FORMULA  satisfy
FORMULA 
for every FORMULA . We notice that FORMULA  is the matrix of
FORMULA  with respect to the orthonormal basis
FORMULA . We can represent this matrix as a block matrix
FORMULA , where FORMULA 
has the matrix FORMULA . Since (REF ) holds and FORMULA , we
deduce from (REF ) that
FORMULA 
Choosing FORMULA , we get
FORMULA 
Hence FORMULA  and the uniform bound FORMULA  also follows from the proof.
Example 6.2 Assume that
FORMULA 

Then
FORMULA 
is a matrix where each translated diagonal FORMULA  has an FORMULA  norm which is summable with
respect to FORMULA . Now a matrix with non-vanishing elements
in only one translated diagonal has a FORMULA  norm equal to the FORMULA 
norm of that diagonal, so we conclude that the FORMULA  norm of the matrix
in (REF ) is bounded by
FORMULA 
We clearly have the same conclusion for every matrix
FORMULA  satisfying
FORMULA , so
(REF ) holds and hence by Theorem REF  we have the
property (REF ).

Further generalizations
Let FORMULA  be a FORMULA -dimensional real vector space and let
FORMULA  be a lattice. We shall extend the preceding results
by replacing the FORMULA -norm in the definition of
the symbol spaces by a more general Banach space norm. Let
FORMULA  be a Banach space of functions FORMULA  with the
following properties:
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
where FORMULA ,
FORMULA ,
FORMULA . (The last assumption will soon be replaced by a stronger one.)
If FORMULA , we get
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  (is independent of FORMULA ). Thus
FORMULA 
We need to strengthen (REF ) to the following assumption:
FORMULA 
It follows that FORMULA ,
for all FORMULA , FORMULA , or equivalently that
FORMULA 
so
FORMULA 
If FORMULA  then using only the translation invariance
(REF ), we get
FORMULA 
Using also (REF ) we get the following partial strengthening: Let
FORMULA  satisfy FORMULA  where FORMULA . Then
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is independent of FORMULA . In fact,
FORMULA 
and FORMULA  in (REF ) satisfies FORMULA  pointwise.
Let FORMULA  be a second lattice and let
FORMULA  satisfy (REF ), (REF ).
We say that FORMULA  if the following property holds for some
FORMULA :
FORMULA 
If (REF ) holds for one FORMULA  and FORMULA  then it also holds with FORMULA 
replaced by FORMULA . This is obvious when FORMULA  and if FORMULA , it follows from the observation that
FORMULA 
(cf. (REF ), where FORMULA  is the integral in (REF ), FORMULA  is
replaced by FORMULA , and we take FORMULA ), which allows us to write
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  belongs to
FORMULA  since (REF ) holds.
Definition 7.1 Let FORMULA  be two lattices in FORMULA  and let
FORMULA  be Banach spaces of functions on FORMULA  and
FORMULA  respectively, satisfying (REF ), (REF ).
Then we say that FORMULA , if FORMULA  and
FORMULA . Notice that this is an equivalence relation.

We can now introduce our generalized symbol spaces. With
FORMULA  as above, let FORMULA  be a lattice
and FORMULA  a Banach space satisfying (REF ), (REF ).
Let FORMULA .
Definition 7.2 We say that FORMULA  if the function
FORMULA 
belongs to FORMULA . Here FORMULA  is the partiction of unity (REF ).

Proposition REF  extends to
Proposition 7.3 
FORMULA  is a Banach space with the natural norm. If we replace
FORMULA  by FORMULA ,
having the same properties, and with FORMULA  equivalent to FORMULA , and if we further replace
the FORMULA  norm by the FORMULA 
norm for any FORMULA , we get the same space, equipped with an
equivalent norm.

Proof 
It suffices to follow the proof of Proposition REF : From the estimate
(REF ) we get for any FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
where we also used that FORMULA  is an order function. Hence, since FORMULA ,
FORMULA  are equivalent,
FORMULA 
The reverse estimate is obtained the same way.
 FORMULA

As a preparation for the use of Bargmann transforms, we next develop a
“continuous” version of FORMULA -spaces; a kind of amalgam spaces
in the sense of {{cite:81c02c75-fa50-44a2-91d2-44d9cf36369b}}, {{cite:d2e654d7-a578-40b3-9191-7847b5c07cf1}}, {{cite:31c6282d-f256-4d62-892d-e6f970c281e3}}.
Let FORMULA  be a lattice in a
FORMULA -dimensional real vector space FORMULA  and let FORMULA 
satisfy (REF ), (REF ). Let FORMULA  satisfy
FORMULA .
Definition 7.4 We say that the locally bounded measurable function FORMULA  is
of class FORMULA , if there exists FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 

The space of such functions is a Banach space that we shall denote by
FORMULA , equipped with the norm
FORMULA 
This space does not depend on the choice of FORMULA  and we may actually
characterize it as the space of all locally bounded measurable functions FORMULA 
on FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is any fixed number. Clearly (REF ) implies (REF ).
Conversely, if FORMULA  satisfies (REF ) and FORMULA  is as in Definition
REF , then
FORMULA 
so if (REF ) holds, we have,
FORMULA 
and FORMULA .
Similarly, the definition does not
change if we replace FORMULA  by an equivalent space
FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be order functions on FORMULA , FORMULA ,
FORMULA  respectively, where FORMULA  is a real vectorspace of
dimension FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be lattices and let
FORMULA 
be Banach spaces satisfying (REF ), (REF ). Introduce the
Assumption 7.5 If FORMULA , FORMULA , then
FORMULA 
converges absolutely for every FORMULA . Moreover, FORMULA  and
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is independent of FORMULA .

Again, it is an easy exercise to check that the assumption is invariant
under changes of the lattices FORMULA  and the passage to corresponding
equivalent FORMULA -spaces.
Proposition 7.6 
We make the Assumption REF , where FORMULA  satisfy (REF ), (REF ).
Let
FORMULA  for FORMULA  in the sense that FORMULA .
Then the integral
FORMULA 
converges absolutely and defines a function FORMULA . Moreover,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is independent of FORMULA , FORMULA .

Proof 
Write
FORMULA 
with FORMULA ,
FORMULA  as in Definition REF  and
with FORMULA . Then
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
We notice that FORMULA  and that FORMULA  only for finitely many FORMULA . Hence
for some FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
Since
FORMULA 
for every fixed FORMULA , and
FORMULA 
the assumption REF  implies that
FORMULA 
for every FORMULA .
The proposition follows.
 FORMULA

We next generalize (REF ). Let FORMULA  and define FORMULA  as in (REF )–(REF ). Let FORMULA  be an order function
on FORMULA , let FORMULA  be a lattice and let
FORMULA  satisfy (REF ), (REF ). Then we get
Proposition 7.7  we have
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the
natural projection.

Proof 
This will be a simple extension of the proof of (REF ). As there, we
identify
FORMULA  with FORMULA  by means of FORMULA 
and work on the latter space. Assume first that FORMULA 
and write
FORMULA  as in Lemma
REF , so that FORMULA .
Using (REF ), we see that
FORMULA 
and hence FORMULA , i.e. FORMULA  belongs to the right hand side
of (REF ) (with the identification FORMULA ).
Conversely, if FORMULA , then since the effective kernel of
FORMULA  satisfies (REF ), we see that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA . It follows that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA , and hence
FORMULA ,
so FORMULA .
 FORMULA

From this, we deduce as in (REF ) that if FORMULA ,
FORMULA , then FORMULA  iff
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the effective kernel of FORMULA  in
(REF ), (REF ) after identification of FORMULA  with FORMULA 
via the map FORMULA . We recall the identity
(REF ) for the composition of two symbols.
(REF ) can also be written
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is given in (REF ).
The following generalization of Theorem REF  now follows from
Proposition REF .
Theorem 7.8 
For FORMULA , let FORMULA  be an order function FORMULA , where
FORMULA , let FORMULA  be a lattice and let
FORMULA  satisfy (REF ), (REF ). Let FORMULA , FORMULA ,
FORMULA . Assuming
(as we may without loss of generality) that FORMULA  where FORMULA  is a lattice, we make the
Assumption REF  for FORMULA .
Then if FORMULA , FORMULA , the composition FORMULA  is well defined and belongs to FORMULA , in the sense that the corresponding composition of effective kernels in (REF ) is given by an absolutely convergent integral and FORMULA .

We next consider the action of pseudodifferential operators on generalized
symbol spaces. Our result will be essentially a special case of the preceding
theorem. We start by “contracting” Assumption REF  to the case when FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be order functions on FORMULA , FORMULA ,
FORMULA  respectively. Let FORMULA , FORMULA  be lattices and let
FORMULA 
be Banach spaces satisfying (REF ), (REF ). Assumption REF  becomes
Assumption 7.9 If FORMULA , FORMULA , then
FORMULA 
converges absolutely for every FORMULA , and we have
FORMULA . Moreover,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is independent of FORMULA .

The corresponding “contraction” of Proposition REF  becomes
Proposition 7.10 
Let Assumption REF  hold, where FORMULA  satisfy (REF ), (REF ). Let
FORMULA  for FORMULA . Then the integral
FORMULA 
converges absolutely and defines a function FORMULA . Moreover,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is independent of FORMULA , FORMULA .

We get the following result for the action of pseudodifferential operators
on generalized symbol spaces.
Theorem 7.11 
Let FORMULA  be order functions on FORMULA  and let
FORMULA  be an order function on FORMULA . Let FORMULA  be a lattice such that FORMULA  where FORMULA 
is a lattice. Let FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
satisfy (REF ), (REF ). We make
the Assumption REF  with FORMULA  and with
FORMULA , FORMULA  replaced with FORMULA ,
FORMULA , where FORMULA  is given in (REF ).
Then, if FORMULA , FORMULA ,
the distribution FORMULA  is well-defined in FORMULA  in the sense that
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  as in (REF ),
converges absolutely for every FORMULA  and
FORMULA 
as in (REF ).

We shall finally generalize Theorem REF .
Theorem 7.12 
Let FORMULA  and let FORMULA  be an order function on FORMULA  where
FORMULA . Let FORMULA  be a lattice and
FORMULA  a Banach space
satisfying (REF ),
(REF ). Assume that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is given in (REF ) and FORMULA  is independent of FORMULA . Then there is a (new) constant FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 

The proof of Proposition REF  shows that the property (REF )
is invariant under changes FORMULA  with FORMULA 
equivalent to FORMULA .
Proof 
We follow the proof of Theorem REF . Assume that (REF ) holds and let
FORMULA  be of norm FORMULA . It suffices to show that
FORMULA  is in FORMULA  with norm FORMULA ,
where FORMULA  is given in () and FORMULA  there belongs
to FORMULA , provided that we identify FORMULA  with
FORMULA  via FORMULA .
We see that we still have
(REF ) where (REF ) should be replaced by
FORMULA 
Write FORMULA  as in (REF ),
FORMULA 
The matrix elements FORMULA  of FORMULA  now
obey the estimate (cf. (REF )):
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  as in (REF ). Using (REF ), this leads to (REF ) and from that point on the proof is identical to that of Theorem
REF .
