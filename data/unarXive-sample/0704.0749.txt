  We review the general relativistic theory of the motion, and of the timing, of binary systems containing compact objects (neutron stars or black holes). Then we indicate the various ways one can use binary pulsar data to test the strong-field and/or radiative aspects of General Relativity, and of general classes of alternative theories of relativistic gravity.
Introduction
The discovery of binary pulsars in 1974 {{cite:14666f44-0579-4106-b196-82dffb5c0eac}} opened up a new testing ground for relativistic gravity. Before this discovery, the only available testing ground for relativistic gravity was the solar system. As Einstein's theory of General Relativity (GR) is one of the basic pillars of modern science, it deserves to be tested, with the highest possible accuracy, in all its aspects. In the solar system, the gravitational field is slowly varying and represents only a very small deformation of a flat spacetime. As a consequence, solar system tests can only probe the quasi-stationary (non radiative) weak-field limit of relativistic gravity. By contrast binary systems containing compact objects (neutron stars or black holes) involve spacetime domains (inside and near the compact objects) where the gravitational field is strong. Indeed, the surface relativistic gravitational field FORMULA  of a neutron star is of order FORMULA , which is close to the one of a black hole (FORMULA ) and much larger than the surface gravitational fields of solar system bodies: FORMULA , FORMULA . In addition, the high stability of “pulsar clocks” has made it possible to monitor the dynamics of its orbital motion down to a precision allowing one to measure the small FORMULA  orbital effects linked to the propagation of the gravitational field at the velocity of light between the pulsar and its companion.
The recent discovery of the remarkable double binary pulsar PSR J0737FORMULA  3039 {{cite:e690c8ce-8cb5-4008-bc97-a03e1ff50536}}, {{cite:c1acf29b-5941-48be-af37-1c3bc9fb3271}} (see also the contributions of M. Kramer and A. Possenti to these proceedings) has renewed the interest in the use of binary pulsars as test-beds of gravity theories. The aim of these notes is to provide an introduction to the theoretical frameworks needed for interpreting binary pulsar data as tests of GR and alternative gravity theories.

Motion of binary pulsars in general relativity
The traditional (text book) approach to the problem of motion of FORMULA  separate bodies in GR consists of solving, by successive approximations, Einstein's field equations (we use the signature FORMULA )
FORMULA 
together with their consequence
FORMULA 
To do so, one assumes some specific matter model, say a perfect fluid,
FORMULA 
One expands (say in powers of Newton's constant)
FORMULA 
together with the use of the simplifications brought by the `Post-Newtonian' approximation (FORMULA ; FORMULA , FORMULA ). Then one integrates the local material equation of motion (REF ) over the volume of each separate body, labelled say by FORMULA . In so doing, one must define some `center of mass' FORMULA  of body FORMULA , as well as some (approximately conserved) `mass' FORMULA  of body FORMULA , together with some corresponding `spin vector' FORMULA  and, possibly, higher multipole moments.
An important feature of this traditional method is to use a unique coordinate chart FORMULA  to describe the full FORMULA -body system. For instance, the center of mass, shape and spin of each body FORMULA  are all described within this common coordinate system FORMULA . This use of a single chart has several inconvenient aspects, even in the case of weakly self-gravitating bodies (as in the solar system case). Indeed, it means for instance that a body which is, say, spherically symmetric in its own `rest frame' FORMULA  will appear as deformed into some kind of ellipsoid in the common coordinate chart FORMULA . Moreover, it is not clear how to construct `good definitions' of the center of mass, spin vector, and higher multipole moments of body FORMULA , when described in the common coordinate chart FORMULA . In addition, as we are interested in the motion of strongly self-gravitating bodies, it is not a priori justified to use a simple expansion of the type (REF ) because FORMULA  will not be uniformly small in the common coordinate system FORMULA . It will be small if one stays far away from each object FORMULA , but, as recalled above, it will become of order unity on the surface of a compact body.
These two shortcomings of the traditional `one-chart' approach to the relativistic problem of motion can be cured by using a `multi-chart' approach.The multi-chart approach describes the motion of FORMULA  (possibly, but not necessarily, compact) bodies by using FORMULA  separate coordinate systems: (i) one global coordinate chart FORMULA  (FORMULA ) used to describe the spacetime outside FORMULA  `tubes', each containing one body, and (ii) FORMULA  local coordinate charts FORMULA  (FORMULA ; FORMULA ) used to describe the spacetime in and around each body FORMULA . The multi-chart approach was first used to discuss the motion of black holes and other compact objects
{{cite:fc790243-7f61-4ca6-9f7f-d109c146433a}}, {{cite:1fae82d1-2b5b-442d-81ce-f91189263774}}, {{cite:6ebbfc34-33e9-42e8-acf1-ae56711eccf4}}, {{cite:ddc3293f-c5f9-443d-970e-c1b83cda626c}}, {{cite:a0b2c9b6-be2b-48ef-baac-121cdb8d5c88}}, {{cite:b1f1b7de-7783-4488-b45c-71c58a4794f3}}, {{cite:be13dc36-c792-4f3b-a971-109a431e0a19}}, {{cite:8012c8be-ce92-4260-ad6e-51f35db844a0}}. Then it was also found to be very convenient for describing, with the high-accuracy required for dealing with modern technologies such as VLBI, systems of FORMULA  weakly self-gravitating bodies, such as the solar system {{cite:97cf2036-c261-476b-b569-5364c5d9b2d1}}, {{cite:93b84041-2338-423f-a84e-51e7f5429fae}}.
The essential idea of the multi-chart approach is to combine the information contained in several expansions. One uses both a global expansion of the type (REF ) and several local expansions of the type
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  denotes the (possibly strong-field) metric generated by an isolated body of mass FORMULA  (possibly with the additional effect of spin).
The separate expansions (REF ) and (REF ) are then `matched' in some overlapping domain of common validity of the type FORMULA  (with FORMULA ), where one can relate the different coordinate systems by expansions of the form
FORMULA 
The multi-chart approach becomes simplified if one considers compact bodies (of radius FORMULA  comparable to FORMULA ). In this case, it was shown {{cite:b1f1b7de-7783-4488-b45c-71c58a4794f3}}, by considering how the `internal expansion' (REF ) propagates into the `external' one (REF ) via the matching (REF ), that, in General Relativity, the internal structure of each compact body was effaced to a very high degree, when seen in the external expansion (REF ). For instance, for non spinning bodies, the internal structure of each body (notably the way it responds to an external tidal excitation) shows up in the external problem of motion only at the fifth post-Newtonian (5PN) approximation, i.e. in terms of order FORMULA  in the equations of motion.
This `effacement of internal structure' indicates that it should be possible to simplify the rigorous multi-chart approach by skeletonizing each compact body by means of some delta-function source. Mathematically, the use of distributional sources is delicate in a nonlinear theory such as GR. However, it was found that one can reproduce the results of the more rigorous matched-multi-chart approach by treating the divergent integrals generated by the use of delta-function sources by means of (complex) analytic continuation {{cite:b1f1b7de-7783-4488-b45c-71c58a4794f3}}. The most efficient method (especially to high PN orders) has been found to use analytic continuation in the dimension of space FORMULA  {{cite:4bae2c7b-43ca-402d-9b97-0694113930f7}}.
Finally, the most efficient way to derive the general relativistic equations of motion of FORMULA  compact bodies consists of solving the equations derived from the action (where FORMULA )
FORMULA 
formally using the standard weak-field expansion (REF ), but considering the space dimension FORMULA  as an arbitrary complex number which is sent to its physical value FORMULA  only at the end of the calculation.
Using this methodOr, more precisely, an essentially equivalent analytic continuation using the so-called `Riesz kernels'. one has derived the equations of motion of two compact bodies at the 2.5PN FORMULA  approximation level needed for describing binary pulsars {{cite:5a98922a-e10e-4d7b-ba84-53d937f30ebf}}, {{cite:14cfa46a-588f-42ad-b307-bbd854bfc8c2}}, {{cite:b1f1b7de-7783-4488-b45c-71c58a4794f3}}:
FORMULA 
Here FORMULA  denotes the Newtonian acceleration, FORMULA  its 1PN modification, FORMULA  its 2PN modification (together with the spin-orbit effects), and FORMULA  the FORMULA PN contribution of order FORMULA . [See the references above; or the review {{cite:473a97dd-96e9-48b5-8e2d-724c339c3aa2}}, for more references and the explicit expressions of FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA .] It was verified that the term FORMULA  has the effect of decreasing the mechanical energy of the system by an amount equal (on average) to the energy lost in the form of gravitational wave flux at infinity. Note, however, that here FORMULA  was derived, in the near zone of the system, as a direct consequence of the general relativistic propagation of gravity, at the velocity FORMULA , between the two bodies. This highlights the fact that binary pulsar tests of the existence of FORMULA  are direct tests of the reality of gravitational radiation.
Recently, the equations of motion (REF ) have been computed to even higher accuracy: 3PN FORMULA  {{cite:a7c923f2-0a6b-4610-b7af-93ac28c3929f}}, {{cite:82853cad-af3f-4e80-8d7b-65e59811329f}}, {{cite:76ed8a14-6983-4f31-ab61-ce576ced84c0}}, {{cite:e8d82259-9fd3-437b-9835-d582275e0cea}}, {{cite:3db0d3fc-b315-43e9-802e-da76afd902b8}} and FORMULA  {{cite:1a3c6bf0-d242-4019-bbf8-ebafb971b14a}}, {{cite:279c165a-fd4e-445e-9155-395ebbaf55c8}}, {{cite:9dd73015-0041-44db-b3ed-7b1a776fdf9a}} (see also the review {{cite:d653a8de-f092-4098-a7ea-5cd96c87dae2}}). These refinements are, however, not (yet) needed for interpreting binary pulsar data.

Timing of binary pulsars in general relativity
In order to extract observational effects from the equations of motion (REF ) one needs to go through two steps: (i) to solve the equations of motion (REF ) so as to get the coordinate positions FORMULA  and FORMULA  as explicit functions of the coordinate time FORMULA , and (ii) to relate the coordinate motion FORMULA  to the pulsar observables, i.e. mainly to the times of arrival of electromagnetic pulses on Earth.
The first step has been accomplished, in a form particularly useful for discussing pulsar timing, in Ref. {{cite:cce62180-2a79-417a-a727-0e74bd917773}}. There (see also {{cite:bc90abc8-c7ef-4ad5-888f-fe275508c1ff}}) it was shown that, when considering the full (periodic and secular) effects of the FORMULA  terms in Eq. (REF ), together with the secular effects of the FORMULA  and FORMULA  terms, the relativistic two-body motion could be written in a very simple `quasi-Keplerian' form (in polar coordinates), namely:
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
Here FORMULA  denotes the orbital frequency, FORMULA  the fractional periastron advance per orbit, FORMULA  an auxiliary angle (`relativistic eccentric anomaly'), FORMULA  and FORMULA  various `relativistic eccentricities' and FORMULA  and FORMULA  some `relativistic semi-major axes'. See {{cite:cce62180-2a79-417a-a727-0e74bd917773}} for the relations between these quantities, as well as their link to the relativistic energy and angular momentum FORMULA . A direct study {{cite:bc90abc8-c7ef-4ad5-888f-fe275508c1ff}} of the dynamical effect of the contribution FORMULA  in the equations of motion (REF ) has checked that it led to a secular increase of the orbital frequency FORMULA , and thereby to a quadratic term in the `relativistic mean anomaly' FORMULA  appearing on the left-hand side (L.H.S.) of Eq. (REF ):
FORMULA 
As for the contribution FORMULA  it induces several secular effects in the orbital motion: various 2PN contributions to the dimensionless periastron parameter FORMULA  (FORMULA  spin-orbit effects), and secular variations in the inclination of the orbital plane (due to spin-orbit effects).
The second step in relating (REF ) to pulsar observations has been accomplished through the derivation of a `relativistic timing formula' {{cite:6f105f96-1886-481a-9bc2-b61c461c4ba2}}, {{cite:8be1b82e-1a47-499b-8db2-49c326b2101f}}. The `timing formula' of a binary pulsar is a multi-parameter mathematical function relating the observed time of arrival (at the radio-telescope) of the center of the  FORMULAth pulse to the integer FORMULA . It involves many different physical effects: (i) dispersion effects, (ii) travel time across the solar system, (iii) gravitational delay due to the Sun and the planets, (iv) time dilation effects between the time measured on the Earth and the solar-system-barycenter time, (v) variations in the travel time between the binary pulsar and the solar-system barycenter (due to relative accelerations, parallax and proper motion), (vi) time delays happening within the binary system. We shall focus here on the time delays which take place within the binary system (see the lectures of M. Kramer for a discussion of the other effects).
For a proper derivation of the time delays occurring within the binary system we need to use the multi-chart approach mentionned above. In the `rest frame' FORMULA  attached to the pulsar FORMULA , the pulsar phenomenon can be modelled by the secularly changing rotation of a beam of radio waves:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the longitude around the spin axis. [Depending on the precise definition of the rest-frame attached to the pulsar, the spin axis can either be fixed, or be slowly evolving, see e.g. {{cite:93b84041-2338-423f-a84e-51e7f5429fae}}.] One must then relate the initial direction FORMULA , and proper time FORMULA , of emission of the pulsar beam to the coordinate direction and coordinate time of the null geodesic representing the electromagnetic beam in the `global' coordinates FORMULA  used to describe the dynamics of the binary system [NB: the explicit orbital motion (REF )–() refers to such global coordinates FORMULA , FORMULA ]. This is done by using the link (REF ) in which FORMULA  denotes the global coordinates of the `center of mass' of the pulsar, FORMULA  the local (proper) time of the pulsar frame, and where, for instance
FORMULA 
Using the link (REF ) (with expressions such as (REF ) for the coefficients FORMULA ) one finds, among other results, that a radio beam emitted in the proper direction FORMULA  in the local frame appears to propagate, in the global frame, in the coordinate direction FORMULA  where
FORMULA 
This is the well known `aberration effect', which will then contribute to the timing formula.
One must also write the link between the pulsar `proper time' FORMULA  and the coordinate time FORMULA  used in the orbital motion (REF )–(). This reads
FORMULA 
where the `tilde' denotes the operation consisting (in the matching approach) in discarding in FORMULA  the `self contributions' FORMULA , while keeping the effect of the companion (FORMULA , etcFORMULA ). One checks that this is equivalent (in the dimensional-continuation approach) in taking FORMULA  for sufficiently small values of the real part of the dimension FORMULA . To lowest order this yields the link
FORMULA 
which combines the special relativistic and general relativistic time dilation effects. Hence, following {{cite:8be1b82e-1a47-499b-8db2-49c326b2101f}} we can refer to them as the `Einstein time delay'.
Then, one must compute the (global) time taken by a light beam emitted by the pulsar, at the proper time FORMULA  (linked to FORMULA  by (REF )), in the initial global direction FORMULA  (see Eq. (REF )), to reach the barycenter of the solar system. This is done by writing that this light beam follows a null geodesic: in particular
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the Newtonian potential within the binary system. This yields (with FORMULA , FORMULA )
FORMULA 
The first term on the last RHS of Eq. (REF ) is the usual `light crossing time' FORMULA  between the pulsar and the solar barycenter. It contains the `Roemer time delay' due to the fact that FORMULA  moves on an orbit. The second term on the last RHS of Eq. (REF ) is the `Shapiro time delay' due to the propagation of the beam in a curved spacetime (only the FORMULA  piece linked to the companion is variable).
When inserting the `quasi-Keplerian' form (REF )–() of the relativistic motion in the `Roemer' term in (REF ), together with all other relativistic effects, one finds that the final expression for the relativistic timing formula can be significantly simplified by doing two mathematical transformations. One can redefine the `time eccentricity' FORMULA  appearing in the `Kepler equation' (REF ), and one can define a new `eccentric anomaly' angle: FORMULA  [we henceforth drop the superscript `new' on FORMULA ]. After these changes, the binary-system part of the general relativistic timing formula {{cite:8be1b82e-1a47-499b-8db2-49c326b2101f}} takes the form (we suppress the index FORMULA  on the pulsar proper time FORMULA )
FORMULA 
with
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  represents the projected light-crossing time (FORMULA ), FORMULA  a certain (relativistically-defined) `timing eccentricity', FORMULA  the function
FORMULA 
FORMULA  the `argument of the periastron', and where the (relativistically-defined) `eccentric anomaly' FORMULA  is the function of the `pulsar proper time' FORMULA  obtained by solving the Kepler equation
FORMULA 
It is understood here that the pulsar proper time FORMULA  corresponding to the FORMULA  pulse is related to the integer FORMULA  by an equation of the form
FORMULA 
From these formulas, one sees that FORMULA  (and FORMULA ) measure some relativistic distortion of the pulsar orbit, FORMULA  the amplitude of the `Einstein time delay'The post-Keplerian timing parameter FORMULA , first introduced in {{cite:6f105f96-1886-481a-9bc2-b61c461c4ba2}}, has the dimension of time, and should not be confused with the dimensionless post-Newtonian Eddington parameter FORMULA  probed by solar-system experiments (see below). FORMULA , and FORMULA  and FORMULA  the range and shape of the `Shapiro time delay'The dimensionless parameter FORMULA  is numerically equal to the sine of the inclination angle FORMULA  of the orbital plane, but its real definition within the PPK formalism is the
timing parameter which determines the `shape' of the logarithmic time delay FORMULA . FORMULA . Note also that the dimensionless PPK parameter FORMULA  measures the non-uniform advance of the periastron. It is related to the often quoted secular rate of periastron advance FORMULA  by the relation FORMULA . It has been explicitly checked that binary-pulsar observational data do indeed require to model the relativistic periastron advance by means of the non-uniform (and non-trivial) function of FORMULA  multiplying FORMULA  on the R.H.S. of Eq. (REF ) {{cite:ddc691b6-6466-4178-a78d-5966b70e01a7}}Alas this function is theory-independent, so that the non-uniform aspect of the periastron advance cannot be used to yield discriminating tests of
relativistic gravity theories.. Finally, we see from Eq. (REF ) that FORMULA  represents the (periastron to periastron) orbital period at the fiducial epoch FORMULA , while the dimensionless parameter FORMULA  represents the time derivative of FORMULA  (at FORMULA ).
Schematically, the structure of the DD timing formula (REF ) is
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  denotes the solar-system barycentric (infinite frequency) arrival time of a pulse, FORMULA  the pulsar emission proper time (corrected for aberration), FORMULA  is the set of Keplerian parameters, FORMULA  the set of separately measurable post-Keplerian parameters, and FORMULA  the set of not separately measurable post-Keplerian parameters {{cite:ddc691b6-6466-4178-a78d-5966b70e01a7}}. [The parameter FORMULA  is a `Doppler factor' which enters as an overall multiplicative factor FORMULA  on the right-hand side of Eq. (REF ).]
A further simplification of the DD timing formula was found possible. Indeed, the fact that the parameters FORMULA  are not separately measurable means that they can be absorbed in changes of the other parameters. The explicit formulas for doing that were given in {{cite:8be1b82e-1a47-499b-8db2-49c326b2101f}} and {{cite:ddc691b6-6466-4178-a78d-5966b70e01a7}}: they consist in redefining FORMULA  and FORMULA . At the end of the day, it suffices to consider a simplified timing formula where FORMULA  have been set to some given fiducial values, e.g. FORMULA , and where one only fits for the remaining parameters FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Finally, let us mention that it is possible to extend the general parametrized timing formula (REF ) by writing a similar parametrized formula describing the effect of the pulsar orbital motion on the directional spectral luminosity FORMULA  FORMULA  received by an observer. As discussed in detail in {{cite:ddc691b6-6466-4178-a78d-5966b70e01a7}} this introduces a new set of `pulse-structure post-Keplerian parameters'.

Phenomenological approach to testing relativistic gravity with binary pulsar data
As said in the Introduction, binary pulsars contain strong gravity domains and should therefore allow one to test the strong-field aspects of relativistic gravity. The question we face is then the following: How can one use binary pulsar data to test strong-field (and radiative) gravity?
Two different types of answers can be given to this question: a phenomenological (or theory-independent) one, or various types of theory-dependent approaches. In this Section we shall consider the phenomenological approach.
The phenomenological approach to binary-pulsar tests of relativistic gravity is called the parametrized post-Keplerian formalism {{cite:c8d8a685-a5ed-46d5-9693-4a1e9af71cbf}}, {{cite:ddc691b6-6466-4178-a78d-5966b70e01a7}}. This approach is based on the fact that the mathematical form of the multi-parameter DD timing formula (REF ) was found to be applicable not only in General Relativity, but also in a wide class of alternative theories of gravity. Indeed, any theory in which gravity is mediated not only by a metric field FORMULA  but by a general combination of a metric field and of one or several scalar fields FORMULA  will induce relativistic timing effects in binary pulsars which can still be parametrized by the formulas (REF )–(REF ). Such general `tensor-multi-scalar' theories of gravity contain arbitrary functions of the scalar fields. They have been studied in full generality in {{cite:14289cc4-0643-4210-90a8-c3ef80819101}}. It was shown that, under certain conditions, such tensor-scalar gravity theories could lead, because of strong-field effects, to very different predictions from those of General Relativity in binary pulsar timing observations {{cite:fedfc497-fc12-4e3e-a765-0ebfb0ee0bf4}}, {{cite:d8d3ba74-a0c9-4d6b-a5d1-1ee70c62e660}}, {{cite:aaa45341-2723-4bb8-ae66-71305bd86fd6}}. However, the point which is important for this Section, is that even when such strong-field effects develop one can still use the universal DD timing formula (REF ) to fit the observed pulsar times of arrival.
The basic idea of the phenomenological, parametrized post-Keplerian (PPK) approach is then the following: By least-square fitting the observed sequence of pulsar arrival times FORMULA  to the parametrized formula (REF ) (in which FORMULA  is defined by Eq. (REF ) which introduces the further parameters FORMULA ) one can phenomenologically extract from raw observational data the (best fit) values of all the parameters entering Eqs. (REF ) and (REF ). In particular, one so determines both the set of Keplerian parameters FORMULA , and the set of post-Keplerian (PK) parameters FORMULA . In extracting these values, we did not have to assume any theory of gravity. However, each specific theory of gravity will make specific predictions relating the PK parameters to the Keplerian ones, and to the two (a priori unknown) masses FORMULA  and FORMULA  of the pulsar and its companion. [For certain PK parameters one must also consider other variables related to the spin vectors of FORMULA  and FORMULA .] In other words, the measurement (in addition of the Keplerian parameters) of each PK parameter defines, for each given theory, a curve in the FORMULA  mass plane. For any given theory, the measurement of two PK parameters determines two curves and thereby generically determines the values of the two masses FORMULA  and FORMULA  (as the point of intersection of these two curves). Therefore, as soon as one measures three PK parameters one obtains a test of the considered gravity theory. The test is passed only if the three curves meet at one point. More generally, the measurement of FORMULA  PK timing parameters yields FORMULA  independent tests of relativistic gravity. Any one of these tests, i.e. any simultaneous measurement of three PK parameters can either confirm or put in doubt any given theory of gravity.
As General Relativity is our current most successful theory of gravity, it is clearly the prime target for these tests. We have seen above that the timing data of each binary pulsar provides a maximum of 8 PK parameters: FORMULA  and FORMULA . Here, we were talking about a normal `single line' binary pulsar where, among the two compact objects FORMULA  and FORMULA  only one of the two, say FORMULA  is observed as a pulsar. In this case, one binary system can provide up to FORMULA  tests of GR. In practice, however, it has not yet been possible to measure the parameter FORMULA  (which measures a small relativistic deformation of the elliptical orbit), nor the secular parameters FORMULA  and FORMULA . The original Hulse-Taylor system PSR 1913FORMULA 16 has allowed one to measure 3 PK parameters: FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA . The two parameters FORMULA  and FORMULA  involve (non radiative) strong-field effects, while, as explained above, the orbital period derivative FORMULA  is a direct consequence of the term FORMULA  in the binary-system equations of motion (REF ). The term FORMULA  is itself directly linked to the retarded propagation, at the velocity of light, of the gravitational interaction between the two strongly self-gravitating bodies FORMULA  and FORMULA . Therefore, any test involving FORMULA  will be a mixed radiative strong-field test.
Let us explain on this example what information one needs to implement a phenomenological test such as the FORMULA  one. First, we need to know the predictions made by the considered target theory for the PK parameters FORMULA  and FORMULA  as functions of the two masses FORMULA  and FORMULA . These predictions have been worked out, for General Relativity, in Refs. {{cite:6f105f96-1886-481a-9bc2-b61c461c4ba2}}, {{cite:bc90abc8-c7ef-4ad5-888f-fe275508c1ff}}, {{cite:8be1b82e-1a47-499b-8db2-49c326b2101f}}. Introducing the notation (where FORMULA )
FORMULA 
they read
FORMULA 
However, if we use the three predictions (REF )–(), together with the best current observed values of the PK parameters FORMULA  {{cite:0f9288ae-0ff8-460e-a6e0-53ff58ea7c76}} we shall find that the three curves FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  in the FORMULA  mass plane fail to meet at about the FORMULA  level! Should this put in doubt General Relativity? No, because Ref. {{cite:eda0342e-f954-4e34-a21c-2de082aeb8be}} has shown that the time variation (notably due to galactic acceleration effects) of the Doppler factor FORMULA  entering Eq. (REF ) entailed an extra contribution to the `observed' period derivative FORMULA . We need to subtract this non-GR contribution before drawing the corresponding curve: FORMULA . Then one finds that the three curves do meet within one FORMULA . This yields a deep confirmation of General Relativity, and a direct observational proof of the reality of gravitational radiation.
We said several times that this test is also a probe of the strong-field aspects of GR. How can one see this? A look at the GR predictions (REF )–() does not exhibit explicit strong-field effects. Indeed, the derivation of Eqs. (REF )–() used in a crucial way the `effacement of internal structure' that occurs in the general relativistic dynamics of compact objects. This non trivial property is rather specific of GR and means that, in this theory, all the strong-field effects can be absorbed in the definition of the masses FORMULA  and FORMULA . One can, however, verify that strong-field effects do enter the observable PK parameters FORMULA  etcFORMULA  by considering how the theoretical predictions (REF )–() get modified in alternative theories of gravity. The presence of such strong-field effects in PK parameters was first pointed out in Ref. {{cite:ddc3293f-c5f9-443d-970e-c1b83cda626c}} (see also {{cite:f491cef4-2dff-4b99-8b4b-8487bc8efb5e}}) for the Jordan-Fierz-Brans-Dicke theory of gravity, and in Ref. {{cite:a0b2c9b6-be2b-48ef-baac-121cdb8d5c88}} for Rosen's bi-metric theory of gravity. A detailed study of such strong-field deviations was then performed in {{cite:14289cc4-0643-4210-90a8-c3ef80819101}}, {{cite:fedfc497-fc12-4e3e-a765-0ebfb0ee0bf4}}, {{cite:d8d3ba74-a0c9-4d6b-a5d1-1ee70c62e660}} for general tensor-(multi-)scalar theories of gravity. In the following Section we shall exhibit how such strong-field effects enter the various post-Keplerian parameters.
Continuing our historical review of phenomenological pulsar tests, let us come to the binary system which was the first one to provide several `pure strong-field tests' of relativistic gravity, without mixing of radiative effects: PSR 1534FORMULA 12. In this system, it was possible to measure the four (non radiative) PK parameters FORMULA  and FORMULA . [We see from Eq. () that FORMULA  and FORMULA  measure, respectively, the range and the shape of the `Shapiro time delay' FORMULA .] The measurement of the 4 PK parameters FORMULA  define 4 curves in the FORMULA  mass plane, and thereby yield 2 strong-field tests of GR. It was found in {{cite:d8aba783-a652-4c93-bff1-32d4be49652e}} that GR passes these two tests. For instance, the ratio between the measured value FORMULA  of the phenomenological parameterAs already mentioned the dimensionless parameter FORMULA  is numerically equal (in all theories) to the sine of the inclination angle FORMULA  of the orbital plane, but it is better thought, in the PPK formalism, as a phenomenological timing parameter determining the `shape' of the logarithmic time delay FORMULA . FORMULA  and the value FORMULA  predicted by GR on the basis of the measurements of the two PK parameters FORMULA  and FORMULA  (which determine, via Eqs. (REF ) , (), the GR-predicted value of FORMULA  and FORMULA ) was found to be FORMULA  {{cite:d8aba783-a652-4c93-bff1-32d4be49652e}}. The most recent data {{cite:60e3895e-9186-496b-9f29-084bf0a4e1fe}} yield FORMULA . We see that we have here a confirmation of the strong-field regime of GR at the 1% level.
Another way to get phenomenological tests of the strong field aspects of gravity concerns the possibility of a violation of the strong equivalence principle. This is parametrized by phenomenologically assuming that the ratio between the gravitational and the inertial mass of the pulsar differs from unity (which is its value in GR): FORMULA . Similarly to what happens in the Earth-Moon-Sun system {{cite:9a4a6aea-4767-4893-89bf-069a25573649}}, the three-body system made of a binary pulsar and of the Galaxy exhibits a `polarization' of the orbit which is proportional to FORMULA , and which can be constrained by considering certain quasi-circular neutron-star-white-dwarf binary systems {{cite:b2723879-1bd9-4ffe-95a7-51884b306550}}. See {{cite:df99118a-f202-4dea-b40d-afe751f16559}} for recently published improved limitsNote, however, that these limits, as well as those previously obtained in {{cite:6894afc2-10f3-4fcf-bc4c-7d8d7e7b0496}}, assume that the (a priori pulsar-mass dependent) parameter FORMULA  is the same for all the analyzed pulsars. on the phenomenological equivalence-principle violation parameter FORMULA .
The Parkes multibeam survey has recently discovered several new interesting `relativistic' binary pulsars, thereby giving a huge increase in the number of phenomenological tests of relativistic gravity. Among those new binary pulsar systems, two stand out as superb testing grounds for relativistic gravity: (i) PSR J1141FORMULA 6545 {{cite:e8ae555e-e717-4447-bd9b-f34d68a9c40a}}, {{cite:d31d5353-9713-42d3-8a26-5fb605539ed0}}, and (ii) the remarkable double binary pulsar PSR J0737FORMULA 3039A and B {{cite:e690c8ce-8cb5-4008-bc97-a03e1ff50536}}, {{cite:c1acf29b-5941-48be-af37-1c3bc9fb3271}}, {{cite:48fcdc7b-91ee-4a98-acac-57469209a44d}}, {{cite:5290af6b-2300-4b61-800a-f25c5bc26a3a}} (see also the lectures by M. Kramer and A. Possenti).
The PSR J1141FORMULA 6545 timing data have led to the measurement of 3 PK parameters: FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA  {{cite:d31d5353-9713-42d3-8a26-5fb605539ed0}}. As in PSR 1913FORMULA 16 this yields one mixed radiative-strong-field testIn addition, scintillation data have led to an estimate of the sine of the orbital inclination, FORMULA  {{cite:6bc66e5b-13b7-4c30-9e85-92d31d4c39db}}. As said above, FORMULA  numerically coincides with the PK parameter FORMULA  measuring the `shape' of the Shapiro time delay. Therefore, one could use the scintillation measurements as an indirect determination of FORMULA , thereby obtaining two independent tests from PSR J1141FORMULA 6545 data. A caveat, however, is that the extraction of FORMULA  from scintillation measurements rests on several simplifying assumptions whose validity is unclear. In fact, in the case of PSR J0737FORMULA 3039 the direct timing measurement of FORMULA  disagrees with its estimate via scintillation data {{cite:5290af6b-2300-4b61-800a-f25c5bc26a3a}}. It is therefore safer not to use scintillation estimates of FORMULA  on the same footing as direct timing measurements of the PK parameter FORMULA . On the other hand, a safe way of obtaining an FORMULA -related gravity test consists in using the necessary mathematical fact that FORMULA . In GR the definition FORMULA  leads to FORMULA . Therefore we can write the inequality FORMULA  as a phenomenological test of GR..
The timing data of the millisecond binary pulsar PSR J0737FORMULA 3039A have led to the direct measurement of 5 PK parameters: FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  {{cite:c1acf29b-5941-48be-af37-1c3bc9fb3271}}, {{cite:48fcdc7b-91ee-4a98-acac-57469209a44d}}, {{cite:5290af6b-2300-4b61-800a-f25c5bc26a3a}}. In addition, the `double line' nature of this binary system (i.e. the fact that one observes both components, FORMULA  and FORMULA , as radio pulsars) allows one to perform new phenomenological tests by using Keplerian parameters. Indeed, the simultaneous measurement of the Keplerian parameters FORMULA  and FORMULA  representing the projected light crossing times of both pulsars (FORMULA  and FORMULA ) gives access to the combined Keplerian parameter
FORMULA 
On the other hand, the general derivation of {{cite:8be1b82e-1a47-499b-8db2-49c326b2101f}} (applicable to any Lorentz-invariant theory of gravity, and notably to any tensor-scalar theory) shows that the theoretical prediction for the the ratio FORMULA , considered as a function of the masses FORMULA  and FORMULA , is
FORMULA 
The absence of any explicit strong-field-gravity effects in the theoretical prediction (REF ) (to be contrasted, for instance, with the predictions for PK parameters in tensor-scalar gravity discussed in the next Section) is mainly due to the convention used in {{cite:8be1b82e-1a47-499b-8db2-49c326b2101f}} and {{cite:ddc691b6-6466-4178-a78d-5966b70e01a7}} for defining the masses FORMULA  and FORMULA . These are always defined so that the Lagrangian for two non interacting compact objects reads FORMULA . In other words, FORMULA  represents the total energy of body FORMULA . This means that one has implicitly lumped in the definition of FORMULA  many strong-self-gravity effects. [For instance, in tensor-scalar gravity FORMULA  includes not only the usual Einsteinian gravitational binding energy due to the self-gravitational field FORMULA , but also the extra binding energy linked to the scalar field FORMULA .] Anyway, what is important is that, when performing a phenomenological test from the measurement of a triplet of parameters, e.g. FORMULA , at least one parameter among them be a priori sensitive to strong-field effects. This is enough for guaranteeing that the crossing of the three curves FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  is really a probe of strong-field gravity.
FIGURE 
In conclusion, the two recently discovered binary pulsars PSR J1141FORMULA 6545 and PSR J0737FORMULA 3039 have more than doubled the number of phenomenological tests of (radiative and) strong-field gravity. Before their discovery, the `canonical' relativistic binary pulsars PSR 1913FORMULA 16 and PSR 1534FORMULA 12 had given us four such tests: one FORMULA  test from PSR 1913FORMULA 16 and three ( FORMULAThe timing measurement of FORMULA  in PSR 1534FORMULA 12 is even more strongly affected by kinematic corrections (FORMULA  terms) than in the PSR 1913FORMULA 16 case. In absence of a precise, independent measurement of the distance to PSR 1534FORMULA 12, the FORMULA  test yields, at best, a FORMULA  15% test of GR.) tests from PSR 1534FORMULA 12. The two new binary systems have given us fiveOr even six, if we use the scintillation determination of FORMULA  in PSR J1141FORMULA 6545. more phenomenological tests: one FORMULA  (or two, FORMULA ) tests from PSR J1141FORMULA 6545 and four (FORMULA ) tests from PSR J0737FORMULA 3039The companion pulsar 0737FORMULA 3039B being non recycled, and being visible only during a small part of its orbit, cannot be timed with sufficient accuracy to allow one to measure any of its post-Keplerian parameters.. As illustrated in Figure REF , these nine phenomenological tests of strong-field (and radiative) gravity are all in beautiful agreement with General Relativity.
In addition, let us recall that several quasi-circular wide binaries, made of a neutron star and a white dwarf, have led to high-precision phenomenological confirmations {{cite:df99118a-f202-4dea-b40d-afe751f16559}} (in strong-field conditions) of one of the deep predictions of General Relativity: the `strong' equivalence principle, i.e. the fact that various bodies fall with the same acceleration in an external gravitational field, independently of the strength of their self-gravity.
Finally, let us mention that Ref. {{cite:ddc691b6-6466-4178-a78d-5966b70e01a7}} has extended the philosophy of the phenomenological (parametrized post-Keplerian) analysis of timing data, to a similar phenomenological analysis of pulse-structure data. Ref. {{cite:ddc691b6-6466-4178-a78d-5966b70e01a7}} showed that, in principle, one could extract up to 11 `post-Keplerian pulse-structure parameters'. Together with the 8 post-Keplerian timing parameters of a (single-line) binary pulsar, this makes a total of 19 phenomenological PK parameters. As these parameters depend not only on the two masses FORMULA  but also on the two angles FORMULA  determining the direction of the spin axis of the pulsar, the maximum number of tests one might hope to extract from one (single-line) binary pulsar is FORMULA . However, the present accuracy with which one can model and measure the pulse structure of the known pulsars has not yet allowed one to measure any of these new pulse-structure parameters in a theory-independent and model-independent way.
Nonetheless, it has been possible to confirm the reality (and order of magnitude) of the spin-orbit coupling in GR which was pointed out {{cite:f8d0decc-4942-45b1-be26-770cd436f10f}}, {{cite:b5b1edcd-b3fa-40fc-9509-a645da01197f}} to be observable via a secular change of the intensity profile of a pulsar signal. Confirmations of general relativistic spin-orbit effects in the evolution of pulsar profiles were obained in several pulsars: PSR 1913FORMULA 16 {{cite:24bff1a9-06c3-4755-b954-3054d0e99941}}, {{cite:0375750b-c9d1-4308-8b5a-8cb9f97daf13}}, PSR B1534FORMULA 12 {{cite:d9e3b4e2-d6fd-4d03-a628-334e8d930260}} and PSR J1141FORMULA 6545 {{cite:f9efb8a6-ece6-47c9-aa9d-136b84313ca6}}. In this respect, let us mention that the spin-orbit interaction affects also several PK parameters, either by inducing a secular evolution in some of them (see {{cite:ddc691b6-6466-4178-a78d-5966b70e01a7}}) or by contributing to their value. For instance, the spin-orbit interaction contributes to the observed value of the periastron advance parameter FORMULA  an amount which is significant for the pulsars (such as 1913FORMULA 16 and 0737FORMULA 3039) where FORMULA  is measured with high-accuracy. It was then pointed out {{cite:1d5bec27-ca0c-4996-ac2b-dd273d5e19bd}} that this gives, in principle, and indirect way of measuring the moment of inertia of neutron stars (a useful quantity for probing the equation of state of nuclear matter {{cite:d1f8f95c-2a91-4d6e-b79e-4e1304adcb88}}, {{cite:dcf9513a-5a04-488e-9cae-087c83d0f6fd}}). However, this can be done only if one measures, besides FORMULA , two other PK parameters with FORMULA  accuracy. A rather tall order which will be a challenge to meet.
The phenomenological approach to pulsar tests has the advantage that it can confirm or invalidate a specific theory of gravity without making assumptions about other theories. Moreover, as General Relativity has no free parameters, any test of its predictions is a potentially lethal test. From this point of view, it is remarkable that GR has passed with flying colours all the pulsar tests if has been submitted to. [See, notably, Fig. REF .] As argued above, these tests have probed strong-field aspects of gravity which had not been probed by solar-system (or cosmological) tests. On the other hand, a disadvantage of the phenomenological tests is that they do not tell us in any precise way which strong-field structures, have been actually tested. For instance, let us imagine that one day one specific PPK test fails to be satisfied by GR, while the others are OK. This leaves us in a quandary: If we trust the problematic test, we must conclude that GR is wrong. However, the other tests say that GR is OK. This example shows that we would like to have some idea of what physical effects, linked to strong-field gravity, enter in each test, or even better in each PK parameter. The `effacement of internal structure' which takes place in GR does not allow one to discuss this issue. This gives us a motivation for going beyond the phenomenological PPK approach by considering theory-dependent formalisms in which one embeds GR within a space of alternative gravity theories.

Theory-space approach to testing relativistic gravity with binary pulsar data
A complementary approach to testing gravity with binary pulsar data consists in embedding General Relativity within a multi-parameter space of alternative theories of gravity. In other words, we want to contrast the predictions of GR with the predictions of continuous families of alternative theories. In so doing we hope to learn more about which structures of GR are actually being probed in binary pulsar tests. This is a bit similar to the well-known psycho-physiological fact that the best way to appreciate a nuance of colour is to surround a given patch of colour by other patches with slightly different colours. This makes it much easier to detect subtle differences in colour. In the same way, we hope to learn about the probing power of pulsar tests by seeing how the phenomenological tests summarized in Fig. REF  fail (or continue) to be satisfied when one continuously deform, away from GR, the gravity theory which is being tested.
Let us first recall the various ways in which this theory-space approach has been used in the context of the solar-system tests of relativistic gravity.
Theory-space approaches to solar-system tests of relativistic gravity
In the quasi-stationary weak-field context of the solar-system, this theory-space approach has been implemented in two different ways. First, the parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism {{cite:ac0ac74f-92b5-49fd-a977-65ce30bcd2e5}}, {{cite:d79adf29-79dd-4338-b57a-7e593e4e3f1c}}, {{cite:56037eaf-1ecd-4ed8-8c2e-d61fa4ebb7a1}}, {{cite:9a4a6aea-4767-4893-89bf-069a25573649}}, {{cite:3698a527-427d-4683-b3bd-aaf93d18998d}}, {{cite:aded21ea-c305-484b-bdec-c5e9256824ac}}, {{cite:8012c8be-ce92-4260-ad6e-51f35db844a0}}, {{cite:02c02f4e-09ab-42bd-8272-2bc10171e846}} describes many `directions' in which generic alternative theories of gravity might differ in their weak-field predictions from GR. In its most general versions the PPN formalism contains 10 `post-Einstein' PPN parameters,  FORMULAThe PPN parameter FORMULA  is usually denoted simply as FORMULA . To distinguish it from the Einstein-time-delay PPK timing parameter FORMULA  used above we add the superscript PPN. In addition, as the value of FORMULA  in GR is 1, we prefer to work with the parameter FORMULA  which vanishes in GR, and therefore measures a `deviation' from GR in a certain `direction' in theory-space. Similarly with FORMULA ., FORMULA . Each one of these dimensionless quantities parametrizes a certain class of slow-motion, weak-field gravitational effects which deviate from corresponding GR predictions. For instance, FORMULA  parametrizes modifications both of the effect of a massive body (say, the Sun) on the light passing near it, and of the terms in the two-body gravitational Lagrangian which are proportional to FORMULA .
A second way of implementing the theory-space philosophy consists in considering some explicit, parameter-dependent family of alternative relativistic theories of gravity. For instance, the simplest tensor-scalar theory of gravity put forward by Jordan {{cite:2444bd24-8dd3-4b4e-adae-f64b7686d8f2}}, Fierz {{cite:91b23723-699d-4f87-8a0e-11004a1583dc}} and Brans and Dicke {{cite:9c2897f5-1c1b-4634-b5db-49e03c87f20b}} has a unique free parameter, say FORMULA . When FORMULA , this theory reduces to GR, so that FORMULA  (or FORMULA ) measures all the deviations from GR. When considering the weak-field limit of the Jordan-Fierz-Brans-Dicke (JFBD) theory, one finds that it can be described within the PPN formalism by choosing FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Having briefly recalled the two types of theory-space approaches used to discuss solar-system tests, let us now consider the case of binary-pulsar tests.

Theory-space approaches to binary-pulsar tests of relativistic gravity
There exist generalizations of these two different theory-space approaches to the context of strong-field gravity and binary pulsar tests. First, the PPN formalism has been (partially) extended beyond the `first post-Newtonian' (1PN) order deviations from GR (FORMULA ) to describe 2PN order deviations from GR FORMULA  {{cite:d4bba8b5-9198-42f4-a00e-5f9fb40db8b4}}. Remarkably, there appear only two new parameters at the 2PN levelWhen restricting oneself to the general class of tensor-multi-scalar theories. At the 1PN level, this restriction would imply that only the `directions' FORMULA  and FORMULA  are allowed.: FORMULA  and FORMULA . Also, by expanding in powers of the self-gravity parameters of body FORMULA  and FORMULA  the predictions for the PPK timing parameters in generic tensor-multi-scalar theories, one has shown that these predictions depended on several `layers' of new dimensionless parameters {{cite:14289cc4-0643-4210-90a8-c3ef80819101}}. Early among these parameters one finds, the 1PN parameters FORMULA  and then the basic 2PN parameters FORMULA  and FORMULA , but one also finds further parameters FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  which would not enter usual 2PN effects. The two approaches that we have just mentionned can be viewed as generalizations of the PPN formalism.
There exist also useful generalizations to the strong-field context of the idea of considering some explicit parameter-dependent family of alternative theories of relativistic gravity. Early studies {{cite:ddc3293f-c5f9-443d-970e-c1b83cda626c}}, {{cite:a0b2c9b6-be2b-48ef-baac-121cdb8d5c88}}, {{cite:f491cef4-2dff-4b99-8b4b-8487bc8efb5e}} focussed either on the one-parameter JFBD tensor-scalar theory, or on some theories which are not continuously connected to GR, such as Rosen's bimetric theory of gravity. Though the JFBD theory exhibits a marked difference from GR in that it predicts the existence of dipole radiation, it has the disadvantage that the weak field, solar-system constraints on its unique parameter FORMULA  are so strong that they drastically constrain (and essentially forbid) the presence of any non-radiative, strong-field deviations from GR. In view of this, it is useful to consider other `mini-spaces' of alternative theories.
A two-parameter mini-space of theories, that we shall denoteWe add here an index 2 to FORMULA  as a reminder that this is a class of tensor-bi-scalar theories, i.e. that they contain two independent scalar fields FORMULA  besides a dynamical metric FORMULA . here as FORMULA , was introduced in {{cite:14289cc4-0643-4210-90a8-c3ef80819101}}. This two-parameter family of tensor-bi-scalar theories was constructed so as to have exactly the same first post-Newtonian limit as GR (i.e. FORMULA ), but to differ from GR in its predictions for the various observables that can be extracted from binary pulsar data. Let us give one example of this behaviour of the FORMULA  class of theories. For a general theory of gravity we expect to have violations of the strong equivalence principle in the sense that the ratio between the gravitational mass of a self-gravitating body to its inertial mass will admit an expansion of the type
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  measures the `gravitational compactness' (or fractional gravitational binding energy, FORMULA ) of body FORMULA . The numerical coefficient FORMULA  of the contribution linear in FORMULA  is a combination of the first post-Newtonian order PPN parameters, namely FORMULA  {{cite:9a4a6aea-4767-4893-89bf-069a25573649}}. The numerical coefficient FORMULA  of the term quadratic in FORMULA  is a combination of the 1PN and 2PN parameters. When working in the context of the FORMULA  theories, the 1PN parameters vanish exactly FORMULA  and the coefficient of the quadratic term becomes simply proportional to the theory parameter FORMULA , where FORMULA . This example shows explicitly how binary pulsar data (here the data constraining the equivalence principle violation parameter FORMULA , see above) can go beyond solar-system experiments in probing certain strong-self-gravity effects. Indeed, solar-system experiments are totally insensitive to 2PN parameters because of the smallness of FORMULA  and of the structure of 2PN effects {{cite:d4bba8b5-9198-42f4-a00e-5f9fb40db8b4}}. By contrast, the `compactness' of neutron stars is of order FORMULA  {{cite:14289cc4-0643-4210-90a8-c3ef80819101}} so that the pulsar limit FORMULA  {{cite:df99118a-f202-4dea-b40d-afe751f16559}} yields, within the FORMULA  framework, a significant limit on the dimensionless (2PN order) parameter FORMULA .
Ref. {{cite:d8d3ba74-a0c9-4d6b-a5d1-1ee70c62e660}} introduced a new two-parameter mini-space of gravity theories, denoted here as FORMULA , which, from the point of view of theoretical physics, has several advantages over the FORMULA  mini-space mentionned above. First, it is technically simpler in that it contains only one scalar field FORMULA  besides the metric FORMULA  (hence the index 1 on FORMULA ). Second, it contains only positive-energy excitations (while one combination of the two scalar fields of FORMULA  carried negative-energy waves). Third, it is the minimal way to parametrize the huge class of tensor-mono-scalar theories with a `coupling function' FORMULA  satisfying some very general requirements (see below).
Let us now motivate the use of tensor-scalar theories of gravity as alternatives to general relativity.

Tensor-scalar theories of gravity
Let us start by recalling (essentially from {{cite:d8d3ba74-a0c9-4d6b-a5d1-1ee70c62e660}}) why tensor-(mono)-scalar theories define a natural class of alternatives to GR.
First, and foremost, the existence of scalar partners to the graviton is a simple theoretical possibility which has surfaced many times in the development of unified theories, from Kaluza-Klein to superstring theory. Second, they are general enough to describe many interesting deviations from GR (both in weak-field and in strong field conditions), but simple enough to allow one to work out their predictions in full detail.
Let us therefore consider a general tensor-scalar action involving a metric FORMULA 
(with signature `mostly plus'), a scalar field FORMULA , and some matter variables FORMULA  (including gauge bosons):
FORMULA 
For simplicity, we assume here that the weak equivalence principle is satisfied, i.e., that the matter variables FORMULA  are all coupled to the same `physical metric'Actually, most unified models
suggest that there are violations of the weak equivalence principle. However, the study of general string-inspired tensor-scalar models {{cite:5ad853c0-fb23-4772-b7c7-037eed940246}} has found that the composition-dependent
effects would be negligible in the gravitational physics of neutron stars that we consider here. The experimental limits on tests of the equivalence principle would, however, bring a strong additional
constraint of order FORMULA . As this constraint is strongly model-dependent, we will not use it in our exclusion plots below. One should, however, keep in mind
that a limit on the scalar coupling strength FORMULA  of order FORMULA 
{{cite:5ad853c0-fb23-4772-b7c7-037eed940246}}, {{cite:159dad14-014e-405b-824c-c2333bb391f7}} is likely to exist in many, physically-motivated, tensor-scalar models. FORMULA . The general model (REF ) involves three arbitrary
functions: a function FORMULA  coupling the scalar FORMULA  to the Ricci scalar of FORMULA , FORMULA , a function FORMULA  renormalizing the kinetic term of FORMULA , and a potential function FORMULA . As we have the freedom of arbitrary redefinitions of the scalar field, FORMULA , only two functions among FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  are independent. It is often convenient to
rewrite (REF ) in a canonical form, obtained by redefining both FORMULA  and FORMULA  according to
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
This yields
FORMULA 
where FORMULA , where the potential
FORMULA 
and where the conformal coupling function FORMULA  is given by
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  obtained by inverting the integral (REF ).
The two arbitrary functions entering the canonical form (REF ) are: (i) the conformal coupling function FORMULA , and (ii) the potential function FORMULA . Note that the `physical metric'
FORMULA  (the one measured by laboratory clocks and rods) is conformally related to the `Einstein metric' FORMULA , being given by FORMULA . The
canonical representation is technically useful because it decouples the two irreducible propagating excitations: the spin-0 excitations are described by FORMULA , while the pure spin-2 excitations are
described by the Einstein metric FORMULA  (with kinetic term the usual Einstein-Hilbert action FORMULA ).
In many technical developments it is useful to work with the logarithmic coupling function FORMULA  such that:
FORMULA 
In the case of the general model (REF ) this logarithmicAs we shall mostly work with FORMULA  below, we shall henceforth drop the adjective `logarithmic'. coupling function is given by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  must be obtained from (REF ).
In the following, we shall assume that the potential FORMULA  is a slowly varying function of FORMULA  which, in the domain of variation we shall explore, is roughly equivalent to a very small mass term FORMULA  with FORMULA  of cosmological order of magnitude FORMULA , or, at least, with a range FORMULA  much larger than the typical length scales that we shall consider (such as the size of the binary orbit, or the size of the Galaxy when considering violations of the strong equivalence principle). Under this assumptionNote, however, that, as was recently explored in
{{cite:acabecea-963c-403b-892f-c6019b9ae75d}}, {{cite:c1b406d9-a62e-4d90-9169-9a9f1b84c212}}, {{cite:7d590aeb-adac-40ae-b5d6-8c424003ea51}}, a sufficiently fast varying potential FORMULA  can change the tensor-scalar phenomenology by endowing FORMULA  with a mass term FORMULA  which strongly depends on the local value of FORMULA  and, thereby can get large in sufficiently dense environments. the potential function FORMULA  will only serve the role of fixing the value of FORMULA  far from the system (to FORMULA ), and its effect on the propagation of FORMULA  within the system will be negligible. In the end, the tensor-scalar phenomenology that we shall explore only depends on one function: the coupling function FORMULA .
Let us consider some examples to see what kind of coupling functions might naturally arise. First, the simplest case is the Jordan-Fierz-Brans-Dicke action, which is of the general type
(REF ) with
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is an arbitrary constant. Using Eqs. (REF ), (REF ) above, one finds that FORMULA  and that the (logarithmic) coupling function is simply
FORMULA 
where FORMULA , depending on the sign chosen in Eq. (REF ). Independently of this sign, one has the link
FORMULA 
Note that FORMULA  must be positive for the spin-0 excitations to have the correct (non ghost) sign.
Let us now discuss the often considered case of a massive scalar field having a nonminimal coupling to curvature
FORMULA 
This is of the form (REF ) with
FORMULA 
The case FORMULA  is usually referred to as that of `conformal coupling'. With the variables (REF ) the theory is ghost-free only if FORMULA  is everywhere positive. If we do not wish to restrict the initial values of FORMULA , we must
have FORMULA . Introducing then the notation FORMULA , we get the following link between FORMULA  and FORMULA :
FORMULA 
For small values of FORMULA , this yields FORMULA . The potential and the coupling functions are given by
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
These functions have singularities when FORMULA  vanishes. If we do not wish to restrict the initial value of FORMULA  we must assume FORMULA  (which then implies our previous assumption FORMULA ). Then there is a one-to-one relation between FORMULA  and FORMULA  over the entire real line. Small values of FORMULA  correspond to small values of FORMULA  and to a coupling function
FORMULA 
On the other hand, large values of FORMULA  correspond to large values of FORMULA , and to a coupling function of the asymptotic form
FORMULA 
The potential FORMULA  has a minimum at FORMULA , as well as other minima at FORMULA . If we assume, for instance, that FORMULA  and the cosmological dynamics are such that the
cosmological value of FORMULA  is currently attracted towards zero, the value of FORMULA  at large distances from the local gravitating systems we shall consider will be FORMULA .
As a final example of a possible tensor-scalar gravity theory, let us discuss the string-motivated dilaton-runaway scenario considered in {{cite:d56f42d0-35be-424b-9502-1f0c5fe643ec}}. The starting action (a functional
of FORMULA  and FORMULA ) was taken of the general form
FORMULA 
and it was assumed that all the functions FORMULA  have a regular asymptotic behavior when FORMULA  of the form FORMULA . Under this assumption the early
cosmological evolution can push FORMULA  towards FORMULA  (hence the name `runaway dilaton'). In the canonical, `Einstein frame' representation (REF ), one has, for large
values of FORMULA , FORMULA , where FORMULA  is a numerical constant, and the coupling function to hadronic matter is given by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the one-loop rational coefficient entering the renormalization-group running of the gauge field coupling FORMULA . This finally yields a coupling function of the approximate form (for
large values of FORMULA ):
FORMULA 
where the dimensionless constants FORMULA  and FORMULA  are both expected to be of order unity. [The constant FORMULA  must be positive, but the sign of FORMULA  is not a priori restricted.]
Summarizing: the JFBD model yields a coupling function which is a linear function of FORMULA , Eq. (REF ), a nonminimally coupled scalar yields a coupling function which interpolates between a quadratic function of FORMULA , Eq. (REF ), and a linear one, Eq. (REF ), and the dilaton-runaway scenario of Ref. {{cite:d56f42d0-35be-424b-9502-1f0c5fe643ec}} yields a coupling function of a decaying exponential type.

The role of the coupling function FORMULA ; definition of the two-dimensional space of tensor-scalar gravity theories  FORMULA
Let us now discuss how the coupling function FORMULA  enters the observable predictions of tensor-scalar gravity at the first post-Newtonian (1PN) level, i.e., in the weak-field conditions appropriate to
solar-system tests. It was shown in previous work that, if one uses appropriate units in the asymptotic region far from the system, namely units such that the asymptotic value FORMULA  of FORMULA  vanishesIn these units the Einstein metric FORMULA  and the physical metric FORMULA  asymptotically coincide., all observable quantities at the 1PN level depend only on the values of the first two derivatives of the FORMULA  at FORMULA . More precisely, if one defines
FORMULA 
and denotes by FORMULA , FORMULA  their asymptotic values, one finds (see, e.g., {{cite:14289cc4-0643-4210-90a8-c3ef80819101}}) that the effective gravitational constant between two bodies (as measured by a Cavendish experiment) is given by
FORMULA 
while, among the PPN parameters, only the two basic Eddington ones, FORMULA , and FORMULA , do not vanish, and are given by
FORMULA 
The structure of the results (REF ) and () can be transparently expressed by means of simple (Feynman-like) diagrams (see, e.g., {{cite:451ac461-c763-46dc-b00f-f2d3df013124}}). Eqs. (REF ) and (REF ) correspond to diagrams where the interaction between two worldlines (representing two massive bodies) is mediated by the sum of the exchange of one graviton and one scalar particle. The scalar couples to matter with strength FORMULA . The exchange of a scalar excitation then leads to a term FORMULA . On the other hand, Eq. () corresponds to a nonlinear interaction between three worldlines involving: (i) the `generation' of a scalar excitation on a first worldline (factor FORMULA ), (ii) a nonlinear vertex on a second worldline associated to the quadratic piece of
FORMULA  (FORMULA ; so that one gets a factor FORMULA ), and (iii) the final `absorption' of a scalar excitation on a third worldline
(second factor FORMULA ).
Eqs. (REF ) and () can be summarized by saying that the first two coefficients in the Taylor expansion of the coupling function FORMULA  around FORMULA  (after setting FORMULA )
FORMULA 
suffice to determine the quasi-stationary, weak-field (1PN) predictions of any tensor-scalar theory. In other words, the solar-system tests only explore the `osculating approximation' (REF ) (slope and local curvature) to the function FORMULA . Note that GR corresponds to a vanishing coupling
function FORMULA  (so that FORMULA ), the JFBD model corresponds to keeping only the first term on the R.H.S. of (REF ), while, for instance, the nonminimally coupled scalar field (with asymptotic value FORMULA ) does indeed lead to nonzero values for both FORMULA  and FORMULA , namely
FORMULA 
Finally the dilaton-runaway scenario considered above leads also to non zero values for both FORMULA  and FORMULA , namely
FORMULA 
for a largish value of FORMULA . Note that the dilaton-runaway model naturally predicts that FORMULA , and that FORMULA  is of the same order of magnitude as FORMULA  with FORMULA  being (positive and) of order unity. The interesting outcome is that such a model is well approximated by the usual JFBD model (with FORMULA ). This shows that a JFBD-like theory could come out from a model which is initially quite different from the usual exact JFBD theory.
As we shall discuss in detail below, solar-system tests constrain FORMULA  and FORMULA  to be both
small. This immediately implies that FORMULA  must be small, i.e., that the scalar field is linearly weakly coupled to matter. On the other hand, the quadratic coupling parameter FORMULA  is not
directly constrained. Both its magnitude and its sign can be more or less arbitrary. Note that there are no a priori sign restrictions on FORMULA . The conformal factor FORMULA  entering Eq. (REF ) had to be positive, but this leads to no restrictions on the sign of FORMULA  and of its various derivativesAs explained above, we assume here the presence of a potential term FORMULA  to fix the asymptotic value FORMULA  of FORMULA . If the potential FORMULA  is absent (or negligible), the `attractor mechanism' of Refs. {{cite:8400660f-468d-4a0b-9471-5917163092cd}}, {{cite:5ad853c0-fb23-4772-b7c7-037eed940246}} would attract FORMULA  to a minimum of the coupling function FORMULA , thereby favoring a positive value of FORMULA .. For instance, in the nonminimally coupled scalar field case, it seemed more natural to require FORMULA , which leads to a negative FORMULA  in view of Eq. (REF ).
Let us summarize the results above: (i) the most general tensor-scalar theoryUnder the assumption that the potential FORMULA  is a slowly-varying function of FORMULA , which modifies the propagation of FORMULA  only on very large scales. is described by one arbitrary function FORMULA ; and (ii) weak-field tests depend only on the first two terms, parametrized by FORMULA  and FORMULA , in the Taylor expansion (REF ) of FORMULA  around its asymptotic value FORMULA .
From this follows a rather natural way to define a simple mini space of tensor-scalar theories. It suffices to consider the two-dimensional space of theories, say FORMULA , defined by the coupling
function which is a quadratic polynomial in FORMULA  {{cite:fedfc497-fc12-4e3e-a765-0ebfb0ee0bf4}}, {{cite:d8d3ba74-a0c9-4d6b-a5d1-1ee70c62e660}}, say
FORMULA 
As indicated, this class of theories depends only on two parameters: FORMULA  and FORMULA . The asymptotic value FORMULA  of FORMULA  does not count as a third parameter (when using the form
(REF )) because one can always work with the shifted field FORMULA , with asymptotic value FORMULA  and coupling function FORMULA . Moreover, as already said, the asymptotic value FORMULA  of FORMULA  has also no physical meaning, because
one can always use units such that it vanishes (as done in (REF )).
Note also that an alternative way to represent the same class of theories is to use a coupling function of the very
simple form
FORMULA 
but to keep the asymptotic value FORMULA  as an independent parameter. This class of theories is clearly equivalent to FORMULA , Eq. (REF ), with the dictionary: FORMULA , FORMULA .

Tensor-scalar gravity, strong-field effects, and binary-pulsar observables
Having chosen some mini-space of gravity theories, we now wish to derive what predictions these theories make for the timing observables of binary pulsars. To do this we need to generalize the general relativistic treatment of the motion and timing of binary systems comprising strongly self-gravitating bodies summarized above. Let us recall that this treatment was based on a multi-chart method, using a matching between two separate problems: (i) the `internal problem' considers each strongly self-gravitating body in a suitable approximately freely falling frame where the influence of its companion is small, and (ii) the `external problem' where the two bodies are described as effective point masses which interact via the various fields they are coupled to. Let us first consider the internal problem, i.e., the description of a neutron star in an approximately freely falling frame where the influence of the companion is reduced to imposing some boundary conditions on the tensor and scalar fields with which it interacts
{{cite:ddc3293f-c5f9-443d-970e-c1b83cda626c}}, {{cite:a0b2c9b6-be2b-48ef-baac-121cdb8d5c88}}, {{cite:14289cc4-0643-4210-90a8-c3ef80819101}}, {{cite:fedfc497-fc12-4e3e-a765-0ebfb0ee0bf4}}, {{cite:d8d3ba74-a0c9-4d6b-a5d1-1ee70c62e660}}. The field equations of a general tensor-scalar theory, as derived from the canonical action (REF ) (neglecting the effect of FORMULA ) read
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  denotes the material stress-energy tensor in `Einstein units', and FORMULA  the FORMULA -derivative of the coupling function, see Eq. (REF ). All tensorial operations in Eqs. (REF ) and () are performed by using the Einstein metric FORMULA .
Explicitly writing the field equations (REF ) and () for a slowly rotating (stationary, axisymmetric) neutron star, labelledWe henceforth use the labels FORMULA  and FORMULA  for the (recycled) pulsar and its companion, instead of the labels FORMULA  and FORMULA  used above. We henceforth use the label FORMULA  to denote the asymptotic value of some quantity (at large radial distances within the local frame, FORMULA  or FORMULA , of the considered neutron star FORMULA  or FORMULA ). FORMULA , leads to a coupled set of ordinary differential equations constraining the radial dependence of FORMULA  and FORMULA  {{cite:d8d3ba74-a0c9-4d6b-a5d1-1ee70c62e660}}, {{cite:707f4b05-297b-4899-a0ba-e06df91e244f}}. Imposing the boundary conditions FORMULA , FORMULA  at large radial distances, finally determines the crucial `form factors' (in Einstein units) describing the effective coupling between the neutron star FORMULA  and the fields to which it is sensitive: total mass FORMULA ,
total scalar charge FORMULA , and inertia moment FORMULA . As indicated, these quantities are functions of the asymptotic value FORMULA  of FORMULA  felt by the considered neutron
starThis FORMULA  is a combination of the cosmological background value FORMULA  and of the scalar influence of the companion of the considered neutron star. It varies with the orbital period and
is determined as part of the `external problem' discussed below. Note that, strictly speaking, the label FORMULA  (for asymptotic) should be indexed by the label of the considered neutron star: i.e. one should use a label FORMULA  (and a locally asymptotic value FORMULA ) when considering the neutron star FORMULA , and a label FORMULA  (with a corresponding FORMULA ) when considering the neutron star FORMULA .. They satisfy the relation FORMULA . From them, one defines other
quantities that play an important role in binary pulsar physics, notably
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
as well as
FORMULA 
The quantity FORMULA , Eq. (REF ), plays a crucial role. It measures the effective coupling strength between the neutron star and the ambient scalar field. If we formally let the
self-gravity of the neutron FORMULA  tend toward zero (i.e., if we consider a weakly self-gravitating object), the function FORMULA  becomes replaced by FORMULA  where FORMULA  is the coupling strength appearing in the R.H.S. of Eq. (). Roughly speaking, we can think of FORMULA  as a (suitable defined) average value of the local coupling strength FORMULA  over the radial profile of the neutron star FORMULA .
FIGURE 
It was pointed out in Refs. {{cite:fedfc497-fc12-4e3e-a765-0ebfb0ee0bf4}}, {{cite:d8d3ba74-a0c9-4d6b-a5d1-1ee70c62e660}} that the strong self-gravity of a neutron star can cause the effective coupling strength FORMULA  to become of order unity, even when its weak-field counterpart FORMULA  is extremely small (as is implied by solar-system tests that put strong constraints on the PPN combination FORMULA ). This is illustrated, in the minimal context of the FORMULA  class of theories, in Figure REF .
Note that when the baryonic mass FORMULA  of the neutron star is smaller than the critical mass FORMULA  the effective scalar coupling strength FORMULA  of the star is quite small (because it is proportional to its weak-field limit FORMULA ). By contrast, when FORMULA , FORMULA  becomes of order unity, nearly independently of the externally imposed FORMULA . This interesting non-perturbative behaviour was related in {{cite:fedfc497-fc12-4e3e-a765-0ebfb0ee0bf4}}, {{cite:d8d3ba74-a0c9-4d6b-a5d1-1ee70c62e660}} to a mechanism of spontaneous scalarization, akin to the well-known mechanism of spontaneous magnetization of ferromagnets. See also {{cite:dca4fde5-2cf9-4275-b92e-198c4cb8f7fb}} for a simple analytical description of the behaviour of FORMULA .
Let us also mention in passing that, in the case where FORMULA  is a black hole, the effective coupling strength FORMULA  actually vanishes {{cite:14289cc4-0643-4210-90a8-c3ef80819101}}. This result is related to the impossibility of having (regular) `scalar hair' on a black hole.
We have sketched above the first part of the matching approach to the motion and timing of strongly self-gravitating bodies: the `internal problem'. It remains to describe the remaining `external problem'. As already mentionned (and emphasized, in the present context, by Eardley {{cite:ddc3293f-c5f9-443d-970e-c1b83cda626c}}, {{cite:8012c8be-ce92-4260-ad6e-51f35db844a0}}), the most efficient way to describe the external problem is, instead of matching in detail the external
fields FORMULA  to the fields generated by each body in its comoving frame, to `skeletonize' the bodies by point masses. Technically this means working with the action
FORMULA 
where the function FORMULA  in the last term on the R.H.S. is the function FORMULA  obtained above by solving the internal problem. Eq. (REF ) indicates that the argument of this
function is taken to be FORMULA , i.e., the value that the scalar field (as viewed in the external problem) takes at the location FORMULA  of the center of mass of body FORMULA . However, as body FORMULA  is described, in the external problem, as a point mass this causes a technical difficulty: the externally determined field FORMULA  becomes formally singular at the location of the point sources, so that FORMULA  is a priori undefined. One can either deal with this problem by coming back to the physically well-defined matching approach (which shows that FORMULA  should be replaced by FORMULA , the value of FORMULA  in an intermediate domain FORMULA ), or use the efficient technique of dimensional regularization. This means that the spacetime dimension FORMULA  in Eq. (REF ) is first taken to have a complex value such that FORMULA  is finite, before being analytically continued
to its physical value FORMULA .
One then derives from the action (REF ) two important consequences for the motion and timing of binary pulsars. First, one derives the Lagrangian describing the relativistic interaction
between FORMULA  strongly self-gravitating bodies (including orbital FORMULA  effects, and neglecting FORMULA  ones) {{cite:8012c8be-ce92-4260-ad6e-51f35db844a0}}, {{cite:ddc3293f-c5f9-443d-970e-c1b83cda626c}}, {{cite:14289cc4-0643-4210-90a8-c3ef80819101}}, {{cite:f491cef4-2dff-4b99-8b4b-8487bc8efb5e}}. It is the sum of
one-body, two-body and three-body terms.
The one-body action has the usual form of the sum (over the label FORMULA ) of the kinetic term of each point mass:
FORMULA 
Here, we use Einstein units, and the inertial mass FORMULA  entering Eq. (REF ) is FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the asymptotic value of FORMULA  far away from the considered
FORMULA -body system.
The two-body action is a sum over the pairs FORMULA  of a term FORMULA  which differs from the GR-predicted 2-body Lagrangian in two ways: (i) the usual gravitational constant FORMULA  appearing as an overall factor in FORMULA  must be replaced by an effective
(body-dependent) gravitational constant (in the appropriate units mentioned above) given by
FORMULA 
and (ii) the relativistic FORMULA  terms in FORMULA  contain, in addition to those predicted by GR, new velocity-dependent terms of the form
FORMULA 
with
FORMULA 
In these expressions FORMULA  (see Eq. (REF ) with FORMULA ).
Finally, the 3-body action is a sum over the pairs FORMULA  and over FORMULA  (with FORMULA , FORMULA , but the possibility of having FORMULA ) of
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  (see Eq. (REF ) with FORMULA ).
When comparing the strong-field results (REF ), (REF ), (REF ) to their weak-field counterparts (REF ), (REF ), () one sees that the body-dependent quantity FORMULA  replaces the weak-field coupling strength
FORMULA  in all quantities which are linked to a scalar effect generated by body FORMULA . Note also that, in keeping with the `3-body' nature of Eq. (REF ), the quantity FORMULA  is linked to scalar interactions which are generated in bodies FORMULA  and FORMULA  and which nonlinearly interact on body FORMULA . The notation used above has been chosen to emphasize that FORMULA  and FORMULA  are strong-field analogs of the usual Eddington parameters FORMULA , FORMULA , so that FORMULA  and FORMULA  are strong-field analogs of the `post-Einstein' 1PN parameters FORMULA  and FORMULA  (which vanish in GR). Indeed the usual PPN results for the post-Einstein terms in the FORMULA  2-body and 3-body Lagrangians are obtained by replacing in Eqs. (REF ) and (REF ) FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA .
The non-perturbative strong-field effects discussed above show that the strong self-gravity of neutron stars can cause FORMULA  and FORMULA  to be significantly different from their GR values FORMULA , FORMULA , in some scalar-tensor theories having a small value of the basic coupling parameter FORMULA  (so that FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are both small). For instance, Fig. REF  shows that it is possible to have FORMULA  which implies FORMULA , i.e., a 50% deviation from GR! Even larger effects can arise in FORMULA  because of the large values that FORMULA  can reach near the spontaneous scalarization transition {{cite:d8d3ba74-a0c9-4d6b-a5d1-1ee70c62e660}}.
Those possible strong-field modifications of the effective Eddington parameters FORMULA , FORMULA , which parametrize the `first post-Keplerian' (1PK) effects (i.e., the orbital effects
FORMULA  smaller than those entailed by the Lagrangian FORMULA ),
can then significantly modify the usual GR predictions relating the directly observable parametrized post-Keplerian (PPK) parameters to the values of the masses of the pulsar and its companion. As worked out in Refs. {{cite:8012c8be-ce92-4260-ad6e-51f35db844a0}}, {{cite:ddc691b6-6466-4178-a78d-5966b70e01a7}}, {{cite:14289cc4-0643-4210-90a8-c3ef80819101}}, {{cite:d8d3ba74-a0c9-4d6b-a5d1-1ee70c62e660}} one finds the following modified predictions for the PPK parameters FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA :
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
Here, the label FORMULA  refers to the object which is timed (`the pulsar'In the double binary pulsar, both the first discovered pulsar and its companion are pulsars. However, the companion FORMULA  is a non recycled, slow pulsar whose motion is well described by Keplerian parameters only.), the label FORMULA  refers to its companion, FORMULA  denotes the projected semi-major axis of the orbit of FORMULA  (in light seconds), FORMULA  and FORMULA  the mass ratios, FORMULA  the orbital frequency and FORMULA  the effective gravitational constant measuring the interaction between FORMULA  and a test object (namely electromagnetic waves on their way from the pulsar toward the Earth). In addition one must replace the unknown bare Newtonian FORMULA  by its expression in terms of the one measured in Cavendish experiments, i.e., FORMULA  as deduced from Eq. (REF ).
The modified theoretical prediction for the PPK parameter FORMULA  entering the `Einstein time delay' FORMULA , Eq. (), is more complicated to derive because one must take into account the
modulation of the proper spin period of the pulsar caused by the variation of its moment of inertia FORMULA  under the (scalar) influence of its companion {{cite:8012c8be-ce92-4260-ad6e-51f35db844a0}}, {{cite:ddc3293f-c5f9-443d-970e-c1b83cda626c}}, {{cite:d8d3ba74-a0c9-4d6b-a5d1-1ee70c62e660}}. This leads to
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  (see Eq. (REF ) with FORMULA ). Numerical studies {{cite:d8d3ba74-a0c9-4d6b-a5d1-1ee70c62e660}} show that FORMULA  can take quite large
values. Actually, the quantity FORMULA  entering (REF ) blows up near the scalarization transition when FORMULA  (keeping FORMULA  fixed). In other words a
theory which is closer to GR in weak-field conditions predicts larger deviations in the strong-field regime.
The structure dependence of the effective gravitational constant FORMULA , Eq. (REF ), has also the consequence that the object FORMULA  does not fall in the same way as FORMULA  in the gravitational
field of the Galaxy. As most of the mass of the Galaxy is made of non strongly-self-gravitating bodies, FORMULA  will fall toward the Galaxy with an acceleration FORMULA , while FORMULA  will fall with an
acceleration FORMULA . Here, as above, FORMULA  is the effective gravitational constant between FORMULA  and any weakly self-gravitating body. As pointed out in Ref. {{cite:b2723879-1bd9-4ffe-95a7-51884b306550}} this possible violation of the universality of free fall of self-gravitating bodies can be constrained by using observational data on the class of small-eccentricity long-orbital-period binary pulsars. More precisely, the quantity which can be observationally constrained is not exactly the violation FORMULA  of the strong equivalence principle [which simplifies to FORMULA  in the case of observational relevance where one neglects the self-gravity of the white-dwarf companion] but ratherThis refinement is given here for pedagogical completeness. However, in practice, the lowest-order result FORMULA  is accurate enough.
{{cite:14289cc4-0643-4210-90a8-c3ef80819101}}
FORMULA 
Here, the index FORMULA  (FORMULA  white-dwarf companion) can be replaced by 0 (weakly self-gravitating body) so that, for instance, FORMULA , as deduced from Eq. (REF ).
It remains to discuss the possible strong-field modifications of the theoretical prediction for the orbital period derivative FORMULA . This is obtained by deriving from the
effective action (REF ) the energy lost by the binary system in the form of fluxes of spin-2 and spin-0 waves at infinity. The needed results in a generic tensor-scalar theory were derived in
Refs. {{cite:14289cc4-0643-4210-90a8-c3ef80819101}}, {{cite:f491cef4-2dff-4b99-8b4b-8487bc8efb5e}} (in addition one must take into account the tensor-scalar modification of the additional `varying-Doppler' contribution to the observed FORMULA  due to the Galactic acceleration {{cite:eda0342e-f954-4e34-a21c-2de082aeb8be}}). The final result for FORMULA  is of the form
FORMULA 
where, for instance, FORMULA  is (heuristicallyContrary to the GR case where a lot of effort was spent to show how the observed FORMULA  was directly related to
the GR predictions for the FORMULA -accurate orbital equations of motion of a binary system {{cite:b1f1b7de-7783-4488-b45c-71c58a4794f3}}, we use here the indirect and less rigorous argument that the energy flux at infinity should be balanced by a corresponding decrease of the mechanical energy of the binary system.) related to the monopolar flux of spin-0 waves at infinity. The term FORMULA  corresponds to the usual quadrupolar flux of spin-2 waves at infinity. It reads:
FORMULA 
with FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the `bare' gravitational constant appearing in the action, while FORMULA  is the gravitational constant measured in Cavendish experiments. The flux (REF ) is the only one which survives in GR (although without any FORMULA -related modifications). Among the several other contributions which arise in tensor-scalar theories, let us only write down the explicit expression of the contribution to
(REF ) coming from the dipolar flux of scalar waves. Indeed, this contribution is, in most cases, the dominant one {{cite:ddc3293f-c5f9-443d-970e-c1b83cda626c}} because it scales as FORMULA , while the monopolar and quadrupolar contributions scale as FORMULA . It reads
FORMULA 
Note that the dipolar effect (REF ) vanishes when FORMULA . Indeed, a binary system made of two identical objects FORMULA  cannot select a preferred direction for a dipole vector, and
cannot therefore emit any dipolar radiation. This also implies that double neutron star systems (which tend to have FORMULA ) will be rather poor emitters of dipolar radiation
(though (REF ) still tends to dominate over the other terms in (REF ), because of the remaining difference FORMULA ). By contrast, very dissymmetric systems such as a neutron-star and a white-dwarf (or a neutron-star and a black hole) will be very efficient emitters of dipolar radiation, and will potentially lead to very strong constraints on tensor-scalar
theories. See below.

Theory-space analyses of binary pulsar data
Having reviewed the theoretical results needed to discuss the predictions of alternative gravity theories, let us end by summarizing the results of various theory-space analyses of binary pulsar data.
Let us first recall what are the best, current solar-system limits on the two 1PN `post-Einstein'
parameters FORMULA  and
FORMULA . They are:
FORMULA 
from frequency shift measurements made with the Cassini spacecraft {{cite:bc0ca0a1-d0c6-4b80-abcc-df80691b6698}}, which supersedes the constraint
FORMULA 
from VLBI measurements {{cite:9dd8d737-4ec2-475f-b50d-dee9e3cd89c9}},
FORMULA 
from Mercury's perihelion shift
{{cite:02c02f4e-09ab-42bd-8272-2bc10171e846}}, {{cite:b59a652f-0690-40d2-8287-4a5fa54c5df3}}, and
FORMULA 
from Lunar laser ranging measurements {{cite:3965db00-6bc6-4f50-a500-b498c437f859}}.
Concerning binary pulsar data, we can make use of the published measurements of various Keplerian and post-Keplerian timing parameters in the binary pulsars: PSR 1913FORMULA 16 {{cite:0f9288ae-0ff8-460e-a6e0-53ff58ea7c76}}, PSR B1534FORMULA 12 {{cite:60e3895e-9186-496b-9f29-084bf0a4e1fe}}, PSR J1141FORMULA 6545 {{cite:d31d5353-9713-42d3-8a26-5fb605539ed0}} and PSR J0737FORMULA 3039AFORMULA B {{cite:c1acf29b-5941-48be-af37-1c3bc9fb3271}}, {{cite:48fcdc7b-91ee-4a98-acac-57469209a44d}}, {{cite:5290af6b-2300-4b61-800a-f25c5bc26a3a}}. In addition, we can useThere is, however, a caveat in the theoretical use one can make of the phenomenological limits on FORMULA . Indeed, in the small-eccentricity long-orbital-period binary pulsar systems used to constrain FORMULA  one does not have access to enough PK parameters to measure the pulsar mass FORMULA  directly. As the theoretical expression of FORMULA  depends on FORMULA  (through FORMULA ), one needs to assume some fiducial value of FORMULA  (say FORMULA ). the recently updated limit on the parameter FORMULA  measuring a possible violation of the strong equivalence principle (SEP), namely FORMULA  at the 95% confidence level {{cite:df99118a-f202-4dea-b40d-afe751f16559}}.
This ensemble of solar-system and binary-pulsar data can then be analyzed within any given parametrized theoretical framework. For instance, one might work within

the 4-parameter framework FORMULA  {{cite:d4bba8b5-9198-42f4-a00e-5f9fb40db8b4}} which defines the 2PN extension of the original (Eddington) PPN framework FORMULA ; or

the 2-parameter class of tensor-mono-scalar theories FORMULA  {{cite:fedfc497-fc12-4e3e-a765-0ebfb0ee0bf4}}; or

the 2-parameter class of tensor-bi-scalar theories FORMULA  {{cite:14289cc4-0643-4210-90a8-c3ef80819101}}.

Here, the index 0 on FORMULA  is a reminder of the fact that this framework is not a family of specific theories (it contains zero explicit dynamical fields), but is a parametrization of 2PN deviations from GR. As a consequence, its use for analyzing binary pulsar data is somewhat ill-defined because one needs to truncate the various timing observables (which are functions of the compactness of the two bodies FORMULA  and FORMULA , say FORMULA ) at the 2PN order (i.e. essentially at the quadratic order in FORMULA  and/or FORMULA ). For some observables (or for product of observables) there might be several ways of defining this truncation. In spite of this slight inconvenience, the use of the FORMULA  framework is conceptually useful because it shows very clearly why and how binary-pulsar data can probe the behaviour of gravitational theories beyond the usual 1PN regime probed by solar-system tests.
For instance, the parameter FORMULA  measuring the strong equivalence principle (SEP) violation in a neutron star has, within the FORMULA  framework, a 2PN-order expansion of the form {{cite:14289cc4-0643-4210-90a8-c3ef80819101}}, {{cite:d4bba8b5-9198-42f4-a00e-5f9fb40db8b4}}
FORMULA 
where FORMULA , FORMULA , with FORMULA  and FORMULA  with FORMULA . The general result (REF ) is compatible with the result quoted in subsection REF  within the context of the theory FORMULA  when taking into account the fact that, within FORMULA , one has FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  [and that FORMULA  parametrizes some effects beyond the 2PN level].
On the example of Eq. (REF ) one sees that, after having used solar-system tests to constrain the first contribution on the RHS to a very small value, one can use binary-pulsar tests of the SEP to set a significant limit on the combination FORMULA  of 2PN parameters. Other pulsar data then yield significant limits on other combinations of the two 2PN parameters FORMULA  and FORMULA . The final conclusion is that binary-pulsar data allow one to set significant limits (around or better than the 1% level) on the possible 2PN deviations from GR (in contrast to solar-system tests which are unable to yield any limit on FORMULA  and FORMULA ) {{cite:d4bba8b5-9198-42f4-a00e-5f9fb40db8b4}}. For a recent update of the limits on FORMULA  and FORMULA , which makes use of recent pulsar data see {{cite:dca4fde5-2cf9-4275-b92e-198c4cb8f7fb}}.
Let us now briefly discuss the use of mini-space of theories, such as FORMULA  or FORMULA , for analyzing solar-system and binary-pulsar data. The basic methodology is to compute, for each given theory (e.g. for each given values of FORMULA  and FORMULA  if one chooses to work in the FORMULA  theory space) a goodness-of-fit statistics FORMULA  measuring the quality of the agreement between the experimental data and the considered theory. For instance, when considering the timing data of a particular pulsar, for which one has measured several PK parameters FORMULA  (FORMULA ) with some standard deviations FORMULA , one defines, for this pulsar
FORMULA 
where `min' denotes the result of minimizing over the unknown masses FORMULA  and where FORMULA  denotes the theoretical prediction (within FORMULA ) for the PK observable FORMULA  (given also the observed values of the Keplerian parameters).
The goodness-of-fit quantity FORMULA  will reach its minimum FORMULA  for some values, say FORMULA , of FORMULA  and FORMULA . Then, one focusses, for each pulsar, on the level contours of the function
FORMULA 
Each choice of level contour (e.g. FORMULA  or FORMULA ) defines a certain region in theory space, which contains, with a certain corresponding `confidence level', the `correct' theory of gravity (if it belongs to the considered mini-space of theories). When combining together several independent data sets (e.g. solar-system data, and different pulsar data) we can define a total goodness-of-fit statistics FORMULA , by adding together the various individual FORMULA . This leads to a corresponding combined contour FORMULA .
Let us end by briefly summarizing the results of the theory-space approach to relativistic gravity tests. For detailed discussions the reader should consult Refs. {{cite:14289cc4-0643-4210-90a8-c3ef80819101}}, {{cite:d8aba783-a652-4c93-bff1-32d4be49652e}}, {{cite:d8d3ba74-a0c9-4d6b-a5d1-1ee70c62e660}}, {{cite:aaa45341-2723-4bb8-ae66-71305bd86fd6}}, {{cite:f9081240-ce0e-4863-8e1f-2a50cf083337}}, and especially the recent update {{cite:dca4fde5-2cf9-4275-b92e-198c4cb8f7fb}} which uses the latest binary-pulsar data.
Regarding the two-parameter class of tensor-bi-scalar theories FORMULA  the recent analysis {{cite:dca4fde5-2cf9-4275-b92e-198c4cb8f7fb}} has shown that the FORMULA  corresponding to the double binary pulsar PSR J0737FORMULA 3039 was defining quite a small elliptical allowed region in the FORMULA  plane. By contrast the other pulsar data define much wider allowed regions, while the strong equivalence principle tests define (in view of the theoretical result FORMULA ) a thin, but infinitely long, strip FORMULA  in the FORMULA  plane. This highlights the power of the double binary pulsar in probing certain specific strong-field deviations from GR.
Contrary to the FORMULA  tensor-bi-scalar theories, which were constructed to have exactly the same first post-Newtonian limit as GRHowever, this could be achieved only at the cost of allowing some combination of the two scalar fields to carry a negative energy flux. (so that solar-system tests put no constraints on FORMULA  and FORMULA ), the class of tensor-mono-scalar theories FORMULA  is such that its parameters FORMULA  and FORMULA  parametrize both the weak-field 1PN regime (see Eqs. (REF ) and () above) and the strong-field regime (which plays an important role in compact binaries). This means that each class of solar-system data (see Eqs. (REF )–(REF ) above) will define, via a corresponding goodness-of-fit statistics of the type, say
FORMULA 
a certain allowed regionActually, in the case of the Cassini data, as it is quite plausible that the positive value of the published central value FORMULA  is due to unsubtracted systematic effects, we use FORMULA  but FORMULA . Otherwise, we would get unreasonably strong FORMULA  limits on FORMULA  because tensor-scalar theories predict that FORMULA  must be negative, see Eqs. (REF ) and (). in the FORMULA  plane. As a consequence, the analysis in the framework of the FORMULA  space of theories allows one to compare and contrast the probing powers of solar-system tests versus binary-pulsar tests (while comparing also solar-system tests among themselves and binary-pulsar ones among themselves). The result of the recent analysis {{cite:dca4fde5-2cf9-4275-b92e-198c4cb8f7fb}} is shown in Figure REF .
FIGURE 
In Fig. REF , the various solar-system constraints (REF )–(REF ) are concentrated around the horizontal FORMULA  axis. In particular, the high-precision Cassini constraint is the lower small grey strip. The various pulsar constraints are labelled by the name of the pulsar, except for the strong equivalence principle constraint which is labelled SEP. Note that General Relativity corresponds to the origin of the FORMULA  plane, and is compatible with all existing tests.
The global constraint obtained by combining all the pulsar tests would, to a good accuracy, be obtained by intersecting the various pulsar-allowed regions. One can then see on Fig. REF  that it would be comparable to the pre-Cassini solar-system constraints and that its boundaries would be defined successively (starting from the left) by 1913FORMULA 16, 1141FORMULA 6545, 0737FORMULA 3039, 1913FORMULA 16 again and 1141FORMULA 6545 again.
A first conclusion is therefore that, at the quantitative level, binary-pulsar tests constrain tensor-scalar gravity theories as strongly as most solar-system tests (excluding the exceptionally accurate Cassini result which constrains FORMULA  to be smaller than FORMULA , i.e. FORMULA ). A second conclusion is obtained by comparing the behaviour of the solar-system exclusion plots and of the binary-pulsar ones around the negative FORMULA  axis. One sees that binary-pulsar tests exclude a whole domain of the theory space (located on the left of FORMULA ) which is compatible with all solar-system experiments (even when including the very tight Cassini constraint). This remarkable qualitative feature of pulsar tests is a direct consequence of the existence of (non-perturbative) strong-field effects which start developing when the product FORMULA  (with FORMULA  denoting, as above, the compactness of the pulsar) becomes of order unity.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we hope to have convinced the reader of the superb opportunities that binary pulsar data offer for testing gravity theories. In particular, they have been able to go qualitatively beyond solar-system experiments in probing two physically important regimes of relativistic gravity: the radiative regime and the strong-field one. Up to now, General Relativity has passed with flying colours all the radiative and strong-field tests provided by pulsar data. However, it is important to continue testing General Relativity in all its aspects (weak-field, radiative and strong-field). Indeed, history has taught us that physical theories have a limited range of validity, and that it is quite difficult to predict in which regime a theory will cease to be an accurate description of nature. Let us look forward to new results, and possibly interesting surprises, from binary pulsar data.
