Abstract
 
Both BaBar and Belle have found evidence for a non-zero width
difference in the FORMULA -FORMULA  system. Although there is no direct
experimental evidence for CP-violation in FORMULA  mixing (yet), we show
that the measured values of the width difference FORMULA 
already imply constraints on the CP-odd phase in FORMULA  mixing,
which, if significantly different from zero, would be an unambiguous
signal of new physics.

The highlight of this year's Moriond conference on electroweak
interactions and unified theories arguably was the announcement by
BaBar and Belle of experimental evidence for FORMULA -FORMULA  mixing
{{cite:6766386f-4994-4b4c-beb1-d9c02abf0940}}, {{cite:c2ddf21e-0fcf-49a8-a06d-de6515a8e808}}, {{cite:722d6e5d-03f5-4fdb-bd0b-e6f09f8202e6}}, which was quickly followed by a number of theoretical
analyses {{cite:fe992927-87c4-4795-bffc-b746bd83e808}}, {{cite:15b4e635-f902-455f-aa4e-0ba25724de92}}, {{cite:6b9e6442-4352-4602-a659-0df3e6adec06}}, {{cite:d8d3c023-91c1-41f6-80a4-d4fdf9802135}}, {{cite:ab4977cf-81da-4f82-ade0-dc4090c5953b}}, {{cite:b735dd8b-c99a-45c5-9acb-5f7af3b3d734}}. While Refs. {{cite:fe992927-87c4-4795-bffc-b746bd83e808}}, {{cite:d8d3c023-91c1-41f6-80a4-d4fdf9802135}}, {{cite:ab4977cf-81da-4f82-ade0-dc4090c5953b}}, {{cite:b735dd8b-c99a-45c5-9acb-5f7af3b3d734}}
focused on the constraints posed, by the experimental results, on
various new-physics models, Ref. {{cite:15b4e635-f902-455f-aa4e-0ba25724de92}} presented a first analysis
of the implications of these results for the fundamental
parameters describing FORMULA  mixing. The
purpose of this letter is to show that the present experimental results
already imply
constraints on a sizeable CP-odd phase in FORMULA  mixing, which could only be
due to new physics (NP).
To start with, let us shortly review the theoretical
formalism of FORMULA  mixing and the experimental results, see
Refs. {{cite:a656e680-b539-418b-91fc-f4857993b9c4}}, {{cite:79af3e26-7050-40f4-a282-51615ab9d60a}} for more detailed reviews.
In complete analogy to FORMULA  mixing, FORMULA  mixing in the SM is due to box
diagrams with internal quarks and FORMULA  bosons. In contrast to FORMULA ,
though, the internal quarks are down-type. Also in contrast to FORMULA 
mixing, the GIM mechanism is much more effective, as the contribution
of the heaviest down-type
quark, the FORMULA , comes with a relative enhancement factor
FORMULA , but also a large CKM-suppression
factor FORMULA , which
renders its contribution to FORMULA  mixing FORMULA  and hence negligible.
As a consequence, FORMULA  mixing is
very sensitive to the potential intervention of NP. On
the other hand, it is also rather difficult to calculate the
SM “background” to FORMULA  mixing,
as the loop-diagrams are dominated by FORMULA  and FORMULA  quarks
and hence sensitive to the intervention of resonances and
non-perturbative QCD.
The quasi-decoupling of the
3rd quark generation also implies that CP violation in FORMULA  mixing is
extremely small in the SM, and hence any observation of CP violation
will be an unambiguous signal of new physics, independently of hadronic
uncertainties.
The theoretical parameters describing FORMULA  mixing can be defined in
complete analogy to those for FORMULA  mixing: the time evolution of the
FORMULA  system is described by the Schrödinger equation
FORMULA 
with Hermitian matrices FORMULA  and FORMULA . The off-diagonal elements
of these matrices, FORMULA  and FORMULA , describe, respectively,
the dispersive and absorptive parts of FORMULA  mixing.
The flavour-eigenstates
FORMULA , FORMULA  are related to the mass-eigenstates
FORMULA  by
FORMULA 
with
FORMULA 
FORMULA  by definition.
The basic observables in FORMULA  mixing are the mass and lifetime
difference of FORMULA , which are usually normalised to the
average lifetime FORMULA :
FORMULA 
In this letter we follow the sign convention of Ref. {{cite:15b4e635-f902-455f-aa4e-0ba25724de92}}, according
to which FORMULA  is positive by definition. The sign of FORMULA  then has to be
determined from experiment.
In addition, if there is CP-violation in the FORMULA  system, one also has
FORMULA 
While previously only bounds on FORMULA  and FORMULA  were known, both BaBar and Belle
have now found evidence for non-vanishing mixing in the FORMULA 
system. BaBar has obtained this evidence from the measurement of the
doubly Cabibbo-suppressed decay FORMULA  (and its CP
conjugate), yielding
FORMULA 
while Belle obtains
FORMULA 
from FORMULA  and
FORMULA 
from a Dalitz-plot analysis of FORMULA .
Here FORMULA  in the limit of no CP violation in FORMULA  mixing,
while the primed quantities FORMULA  are related to FORMULA  by a rotation
by a strong phase FORMULA :
FORMULA 
Limited experimental information on this
phase has been obtainted at CLEO-c {{cite:1d5475ea-0a77-4fd0-a2ae-73fc1c8d038c}}:
FORMULA 
which can be translated into FORMULA .
An analysis with a larger data-set is underway at CLEO-c, with an expected
uncertainty of FORMULA  in the next
couple of years
{{cite:fb40063c-5090-40b7-8be2-cada88bf47c6}}; BES-III is expected to reach FORMULA  after 4 years of running {{cite:0fd21507-2d40-4af1-a762-c9f6cf50db79}}.
The experimental result (REF ) agrees with theoretical expectations,
FORMULA  in the SU(3)-limit and FORMULA  from a calculation of the amplitudes in QCD
factorisation {{cite:39888d5c-2115-4872-97f3-24e34ae6fded}}.
Based on these experimental results,
a preliminary HFAG-average
was presented at the 2007 CERN workshop “Flavour in the
Era of the LHC” {{cite:fb40063c-5090-40b7-8be2-cada88bf47c6}}:
FORMULA 
Adding errors in quadrature, this implies
FORMULA 
The exact relations between FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are given by
FORMULA 
Eq. (REF ) implies FORMULA  for FORMULA  and FORMULA 
for FORMULA . In view of the above experimental results,
we assume FORMULA  from now on.
As for the CP-violating observables, FORMULA  characterises
CP-violation in mixing and can be measured for instance
in flavour-specific decays
FORMULA , where FORMULA  is possible only via mixing. The
prime example is semileptonic decays with
FORMULA 
Although the B factories may have some sensitivity to this asymmetry,
its measurement is severely impaired by the fact that FORMULA  mixing
proceeds only very slowly, resulting in a large suppression factor of
the mixed vs. the unmixed rate:
FORMULA 
Both in the FORMULA  and the FORMULA  system the quantity
FORMULA 
is very small, which
however need not necessarily be the case for FORMULA 's. From (REF ) one
derives the general expression
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  and the weak phase FORMULA  defined in (REF ).
In the FORMULA  system, one has FORMULA  (the
current up-to-date numbers are FORMULA  for FORMULA 
and FORMULA  for FORMULA  {{cite:3092255b-67c7-4a09-8292-0decfbcde09b}}),
so that upon expansion in  FORMULA
FORMULA 
Note that this formula refers to the definition FORMULA , which differs by FORMULA  from the one used in
Ref. {{cite:3092255b-67c7-4a09-8292-0decfbcde09b}}, FORMULA .
For the FORMULA  system, one finds FORMULA  from experiment, but now
the phase FORMULA  turns out to be small, so that
FORMULA 
In both cases, FORMULA  to a very good approximation. In the
FORMULA  system, however, there is no natural hierarchy FORMULA , and of
course one hopes that NP-effects induce
FORMULA . In this case, and because FORMULA  and
FORMULA  have been measured, while FORMULA  and FORMULA  are
difficult to calculate, it is convenient to express
FORMULA  in terms of FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , using the exact relations
(REF ).
From (REF ), and defining FORMULA , we then obtain
FORMULA 
Note that for finite
FORMULA  and FORMULA , FORMULA  diverges
because FORMULA  for FORMULA  from (REF ).
In Fig. REF  we plot FORMULA  as function of FORMULA , for the
central experimental value from HFAG, FORMULA ,
Eq. (REF ).
FIGURE 
It is obvious that even for moderate values of FORMULA  the small-FORMULA 
expansion is not really reliable.
What is the currently available experimental information on
CP-violating in FORMULA  mixing, i.e. FORMULA 
and FORMULA ?
As already mentioned, the semileptonic CP-asymmetry (REF ) has not
been measured yet. What has been measured, though, is the effect of
CP-violation on the time-dependent rates of FORMULA  and
FORMULA . The BaBar collaboration has parametrised these
rates as
FORMULA 
and fit the FORMULA  and FORMULA  samples separately.
They find {{cite:c2ddf21e-0fcf-49a8-a06d-de6515a8e808}}
FORMULA 
Adding errors in quadrature, this means FORMULA .
BaBar also obtains values for
FORMULA  which we do not quote here, because the
sensitivity to the quadratic term in (REF ) is less than that to
the linear term in FORMULA . FORMULA  is the ratio of the
doubly Cabbibo-suppressed to the Cabibbo-favoured amplitude,
FORMULA . FORMULA 
is the relative strong phase in the Cabibbo-favoured and suppressed
amplitudes:
FORMULA 
the minus-sign comes from the relative sign between the CKM matrix
elements FORMULA  and FORMULA .
In the limit of
no CP-violation in the decay amplitude, one has FORMULA , which is expected to be a very good
approximation, in view of the fact that the decay is solely due to a
tree-level amplitude. Then the relation of FORMULA  to FORMULA , FORMULA  and
FORMULA  is given by
FORMULA 
Presently, the experimental result for
FORMULA  is compatible with 1, although with
considerable uncertainties. Any significant deviation from 1 would
be a sign for new physics. In Fig. REF  we plot FORMULA  as
function of FORMULA , for different values of FORMULA  and FORMULA .
FIGURE 
The figures clearly show that the value of FORMULA  is very sensitive
to the phase FORMULA , at least if FORMULA  is not too close to
FORMULA , which corresponds to
the nearly constant dashed line in Fig. REF b. The
reason for this dependence on FORMULA 
becomes clearer if FORMULA  is expanded to first
order in FORMULA :
FORMULA 
For the central values of FORMULA  and FORMULA , Eq. (REF ),
this amounts to FORMULA  for FORMULA , FORMULA  for
FORMULA  and FORMULA  for
FORMULA , which explains the shape of the curves in
Fig. REF b. Evidently it is important to reduce the
uncertainty of FORMULA , which, as mentioned earlier, will be
achieved within the next few years. On
the other hand, as shown in Fig. REF a, FORMULA , which
depends only on the ratio FORMULA , but not FORMULA  and FORMULA  separately,
is not very sensitive to the
precise value of that ratio, but very much so to FORMULA .
The conclusion is that, even if FORMULA  itself
cannot be determined very precisely, FORMULA 
will nonetheless be a powerful tool to constrain FORMULA , at least once
FORMULA  will be known more precisely. Already now very large
values FORMULA  are excluded.
Another, more theory-dependent constraint on FORMULA  can be derived
from the value of FORMULA . This argument centers around the fact that
(a) the experimental result
(REF ) is at the top end of theoretical predictions FORMULA  {{cite:77d1e24e-a612-45ab-9af6-9930493ee15f}} and (b) new
physics indicated by a non-zero value of FORMULA  always reduces the lifetime difference, independently of the value of
FORMULA . This observation is similar to what
was found, some time ago, for the FORMULA  system {{cite:ca8cbb96-2069-4a04-acb1-733961d0ab58}}.
In order to derive it, we assume
that new physics does not affect FORMULA ,See, however,
Ref. {{cite:1af5ab7b-5d0e-4340-bc67-06cd5853da53}} for a discussion
of the effect of tiny NP admixtures to FORMULA . so that
FORMULA .
We then have
FORMULA  and hence FORMULA . Using the relations (REF ), we can
then express the ratio FORMULA  in terms
of FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA :
FORMULA 
This implies that new physics
always reduces the lifetime difference, independently of the value of
FORMULA  (and any new physics in the mass difference). In particular one has
FORMULA  for FORMULA  and FORMULA , which follows from the 2nd
relation (REF ). Eq. (REF ) is the manifestation of
the fact that one does not need to observe CP-violation in order
to constrain it. A famous example for this is the unitarity triangle
in FORMULA  physics, whose sides are determined from CP-conserving
quantities only, but nonetheless allow a precise measurement of the size of
CP-violation in the SM, via the angles and the area of the triangle.
FIGURE 
In Fig. REF , we plot FORMULA 
as a function of FORMULA . The zero at FORMULA  is
clearly visible. The experimental value FORMULA  then
excludes phases FORMULA  close to FORMULA . In order to make more
quantitative statements, apparently a more precise calculation of
FORMULA  is needed.
Two more CP-sensitive observables related to FORMULA  have
been measured by the Belle collaboration {{cite:722d6e5d-03f5-4fdb-bd0b-e6f09f8202e6}}:
FORMULA 
The present experimental value of FORMULA  is given in (REF ), that for
FORMULA  is FORMULA . Again, we can study the dependence of these observables on
FORMULA . In Fig. REF a we plot the ratio
FORMULA , which is a function
of FORMULA  and FORMULA , in dependence on FORMULA . As it turns out, this
quantity is far less sensitive to FORMULA  than FORMULA , the reason
being that its deviation from 1 is only a second-order effect in FORMULA :
FORMULA 
Hence, unless the experimental accuracy is dramatically increased, and
because the results on FORMULA  and FORMULA  already exclude
a large CP-odd phase FORMULA , it
is safe to interpret FORMULA  as measurement of FORMULA .
FIGURE 
In Fig. REF b we plot the quantity FORMULA . Also
here there is a distinctive dependence on FORMULA , with
FORMULA  for small FORMULA , but the effect is
less dramatic than that in FORMULA .
In conclusion, we find that the experimental results on FORMULA  mixing
reported by BaBar and Belle already exclude extreme values of the
CP-odd phase FORMULA  close to FORMULA . This follows from the
result for FORMULA , which is close to the top end of theoretical predictions
and can only be reduced by new physics, and from
FORMULA . While FORMULA  vanishes in the limit of no
CP-violation, FORMULA  is a CP-conserving observable, which
demonstrates the usefulness of such quantities in constraining
CP-odd phases.
Also FORMULA , FORMULA  and the ratio
FORMULA  can be useful in constraining FORMULA .
As long as there is no
major breakthrough in theoretical predictions for FORMULA  mixing, which
are held back by the fact that the FORMULA  meson is at the same time too heavy and
too light for current theoretical tools to get a proper grip on
the problem, the long-distance SM contributions to FORMULA  will completely
obscure any NP contributions and their detection. The observation of CP
violation, however, presents a theoretically clean way for NP to manifest
itself and it is to be hoped that in the near future, i.e. at the FORMULA 
factories or the LHC, at least one of the plentiful opportunities for
NP to show up in CP violation {{cite:e39bdb49-746c-4648-a982-af977a36d5de}} will be realised.
