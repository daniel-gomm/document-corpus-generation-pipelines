The intrinsic Zeeman energy is precisely one half of the
cyclotron energy for electrons in graphene.
As a result a Landau-level mixing occurs
to create the energy spectrum comprised of the FORMULA -fold degenerated
zero-energy level and 4-fold degenerated nonzero-energy levels
in the FORMULA -layer graphene,
where FORMULA  for monolayer, bilayer and trilayer, respectively.
The degeneracy manifests itself in the quantum Hall (QH) effect.
We study how the degeneracy is removed by the Coulomb interactions.
With respect to the zero-energy level,
an excitonic gap opens by making a BCS-type condensation of electron-hole pairs
at the filling factor FORMULA .
It gives birth to the Ising QH ferromagnet at FORMULA  for monolayer, FORMULA  for bilayer, and FORMULA  for trilayer graphene from the zero-energy degeneracy.
With respect to the nonzero-energy level,
a remarkable consequence is derived that the effective Coulomb potential
depends on spins, since a single energy level contains up-spin and
down-spin electrons belonging to different Landau levels.
The spin-dependent Coulomb interaction leads to the valley polarization at FORMULA  for monolayer,
FORMULA  for bilayer,
and FORMULA  for trilayer graphene.
Introduction
Recent experiments has established that the charge carriers in graphene are
massless Dirac electrons{{cite:c0ad5e7f-6680-41ac-ab3f-19ad188a8163}}, {{cite:a89c73a7-9eb9-4669-8642-8483f7333570}}, {{cite:53a3e520-c20d-4287-bce1-9891de4bf38e}}, {{cite:bc956f0c-c15a-4c85-b2b6-c6a4aa48996f}}, {{cite:928ca9bb-c06b-4c30-bd8d-868d90e8e884}}. Dirac
electrons have a peculiar property that they have the intrinsic Zeeman
energy precisely one half of the cyclotron energy in magnetic field.
Consequently a Landau level mixing occurs so that one energy level contains
up-spin and down-spin electrons coming from different Landau levels. It has
two important consequences; the emergence of the zero-energy state{{cite:3fb623a5-3ed7-4e2a-91d1-f3a56e41609d}}, and the degeneracy of the up-spin and down-spin states for each
nonzero-energy level [Fig.REF (a)]. The aim of this paper is
to explore new phenomena due to this intrinsic Zeeman effect in graphene.
The quantum Hall effect (QHE) in graphene{{cite:c0ad5e7f-6680-41ac-ab3f-19ad188a8163}}, {{cite:a89c73a7-9eb9-4669-8642-8483f7333570}}, {{cite:53a3e520-c20d-4287-bce1-9891de4bf38e}}, {{cite:bc956f0c-c15a-4c85-b2b6-c6a4aa48996f}}, {{cite:928ca9bb-c06b-4c30-bd8d-868d90e8e884}}
is unconventional. The filling factors form a series [Fig.REF (b)],
FORMULA 
where the bold-face series had been predicted{{cite:db00a9b4-b9a1-4265-bef8-077f2a440f58}}, {{cite:e86c6ddd-cd86-4847-a7ff-5aa5f7086c8c}}, {{cite:ef834697-4703-4298-a3d2-293566268569}} before it was found experimentally{{cite:c0ad5e7f-6680-41ac-ab3f-19ad188a8163}}, {{cite:a89c73a7-9eb9-4669-8642-8483f7333570}}, {{cite:53a3e520-c20d-4287-bce1-9891de4bf38e}}, {{cite:bc956f0c-c15a-4c85-b2b6-c6a4aa48996f}}, while the full series was discovered later{{cite:928ca9bb-c06b-4c30-bd8d-868d90e8e884}} with larger magnetic field applied. Subsequently theoretical
works{{cite:7093b5b6-c028-48f9-94f4-d6a03d333770}}, {{cite:5da76232-d78e-4ec4-a8ef-d3d36ac9d56a}}, {{cite:0792b923-5950-4ecc-8721-e4074a235b62}}, {{cite:8f4796d9-ad51-40cc-ab8a-b8ceefd09140}}, {{cite:f5c0fc8f-ce8e-4558-a381-92530658cca5}} have been made to
interpret the series. Furthermore, the series reads
FORMULA 
in a bilayer graphene, where the bold-face series has been found
experimentally{{cite:bc956f0c-c15a-4c85-b2b6-c6a4aa48996f}} and studied theoretically{{cite:2d621172-c9a5-4eea-ba02-4d3bf4b6a66d}}, while it
reads
FORMULA 
in a trilayer graphene, where the bold-face series has been predicted
theoretically{{cite:f69a7d06-4e57-4242-811d-47e1e0122477}}. In this paper we show that the full series
emerge when Coulomb interactions become important. It is notable that the
basic height in the Hall conductance is FORMULA  for the bold-face series
for all these graphene systems, indicating the 4-fold degeneracy of the
energy level except for the first step at the FORMULA  point within
noninteracting theory.
FIGURE 
Conduction and valence bands in graphene form conically shaped valleys,
touching at a point [Fig.REF ]. There are two inequivalent
Brillouin zone corners, called the K and K' points, at which massless Dirac
electrons emerge{{cite:5f9fa789-a16f-4eb1-b07a-19c110baf0db}}, {{cite:f138650d-b431-4f96-b8bb-2dd98a4491e8}}, {{cite:0ffab13d-8fc2-45a2-a8cb-1cd5fe2bec44}}. Let us refer to the
valley as the Dirac valley, and assign the valley index to the electron so
that the electron at the K (K') point carries the index FORMULA  (FORMULA ). As
we have mentioned, the graphene QH system is characterized by the emergence
of the zero-energy state and the degeneracy of the up-spin and down-spin
states for each nonzero-energy level. Since this holds separately at the K
and K' points, each energy level has a 4-fold degeneracy [Fig.REF (a)], and the noninteracting system has the SU(4) symmetry.
Intriguing phenomena occur when we introduce Coulomb interactions. It is
necessary to consider the Coulomb effect in the zero-energy state and
nonzero-energy states separately.
The zero-energy state is distinctive, since it contains both electrons and
holes. Electron-hole pairs form an excitonic condensation due to attractive
interaction, producing an excitonic gap. We obtain a BCS-type state of
electron-hole pairs at FORMULA . As a consequence of excitonic condensation,
the degeneracy of the zero-energy state is resolved into two subbands each
of which contains either electrons or holes. The Coulomb Hamiltonian,
projected to each of them, has the U(1) symmetry but is broken into the ZFORMULA  symmetry. We obtain the Ising QH ferromagnet at FORMULA .
We next study nonzero-energy states of electrons, where a single energy
level contains up-spin and down-spin electrons belonging to different Landau
levels [Fig.REF (a)]. We derive a remarkable consequence that
the effective Coulomb potential depends on the spin and the valley in each
energy level. Namely, it depends on the spin of electrons as well as on
which valley electrons belongs to. The Coulomb Hamiltonian, projected to a
single energy level, possesses only the U(1)FORMULA U(1)FORMULA ZFORMULA 
symmetry. Consequently, the Coulomb interaction resolves the 4-fold
degeneracy into two 2-fold degeneracies, generating a new series at FORMULA . The ground state is a valley polarized state,
by which we mean that more electrons are present in one valley than the
other. This occurs because the Coulomb energy is lower in higher Landau
levels.
Our analysis can be generalized to the FORMULA -layer graphene system, where FORMULA , 2 and 3 correspond to monolayer, bilayer and trilayer, respectively.
We show that the zero-energy states have the FORMULA -fold degeneracy. As a
result the quantized values of the Hall conductivity become
FORMULA 
within noninteracting theory. We also discuss the effects due to Coulomb
interactions.
This paper is composed as follows. In Section  we investigate
the energy spectrum in the presence of magnetic field. We show that two
Landau levels mix to create one energy level. In Section 
we construct the projected Coulomb Hamiltonian relevant to analyze physics
in the FORMULA th energy level. The effective Coulomb potential is shown to
depend on the spin and the valley through the form factors characterizing
Landau levels. In Section  we treat the zero-energy level (FORMULA ), which contains both electrons and holes. We present a clear-cut
description of an excitonic condensation, producing a gap to the electron
and hole states, on the analogy of the BCS superconductor. In Section , studying how Coulomb interactions resolve the degeneracy of
the nonzero-energy level, we derive the valley polarized ground state. In
Section  our analysis is generalized to multilayer
graphene systems. Finally, Section  is devoted to discussions.

Dirac Electrons and Intrinsic Zeeman Effect
Dirac Hamiltonian
The low-energy band structure of graphene is described by conically shaped
valleys, touching at a point. There exists two inequivalent Brillouin zone
corners FORMULA  with FORMULA  the lattice
constant. They are called the K and K' points [Fig.REF (b)]. The
two-dimensional energy dispersion relation is linear in these Dirac valleys,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the Fermi velocity, and FORMULA  is the valley
index. This linear behavior has been confirmed experimentally{{cite:07a937f2-2e50-4456-b869-d95cb8efa338}} up
to 3eV. It is convenient to make the change of variable, FORMULA , and rewrite the dispersion relation as
FORMULA 
We use the variable FORMULA  to show that FORMULA  is the relative momentum of electrons, FORMULA , measured from FORMULA  at the K or K' point.
There exists one electron per one carbon and the band-filling factor is 1/2
in graphene. Hence we have electron excitations in the conduction band and
hole excitations in the valence band. Furthermore there exists the
electron-hole symmetry.
The dispersion relation (REF ) is that of `relativistic' Dirac
fermions{{cite:5f9fa789-a16f-4eb1-b07a-19c110baf0db}}, {{cite:f138650d-b431-4f96-b8bb-2dd98a4491e8}}, {{cite:0ffab13d-8fc2-45a2-a8cb-1cd5fe2bec44}}. Hence the second-quantized
Hamiltonian is given by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the quantum mechanical Hamiltonian,
FORMULA 
with FORMULA , the Pauli matrix FORMULA  and
the Dirac matrix FORMULA . The field FORMULA 
consists of eight components, corresponding to the spin degree of freedom,
the electron-hole degree of freedom and the valley degree of freedom. Being
massless, the Hamiltonian describes Weyl fermions, and the spin index FORMULA  represents the helicity.
The field operator FORMULA  is expanded in terms of the
eigenfunctions of FORMULA  as
FORMULA 
with
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the annihilation operator of an electron
and the creation operator of a hole, respectively, while FORMULA  and FORMULA  are
the corresponding eigenfunctions of the Dirac operator (REF )
with the eigenvalue FORMULA .
The field FORMULA  describes solely the dynamics of
electrons localized in each Dirac valley at the K or K' point. In the
dispersion relation (REF ), FORMULA  is the
momentum fluctuation around FORMULA  at the K or K' point. The
total momentum of the electron is not FORMULA  but FORMULA . Due to
this fact, the eigenfunctions FORMULA 
and FORMULA  are not wave functions but
envelope functions{{cite:5b3e1d53-a443-430d-9d0b-b4f2935095d5}}. The wave functions are given by FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Accordingly, the field operators of electrons and holes are
FORMULA 
Thus, to analyze the Coulomb interaction, it is necessary to use FORMULA  and FORMULA . In
Appendix  we derive the Dirac Hamiltonian (REF ) based on the effective-mass description{{cite:5b3e1d53-a443-430d-9d0b-b4f2935095d5}}.
We make a comment on the factor FORMULA  in front of FORMULA  in (REF ). It has the standard expression of the Dirac Hamiltonian for FORMULA , that is, at the K point. The K point is transformed into the K'
point under the mirror reflection. Corresponding to this we have the
mirror-reflected Dirac Hamiltonian (REF ) for FORMULA , that
is, at the K' point. The total Hamiltonian (REF ) has the
mirror symmetry.

Landau Levels
We apply the magnetic field to a graphene sheet taken on the FORMULA  plane. It
is introduced to the Hamiltonian (REF ) by making the minimal
substitution,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the covariant momentum.
We assume a homogeneous magnetic field FORMULA  with FORMULA  along the FORMULA  axis. The presence of the
external magnetic field modifies the mirror symmetry as follows: The
modified mirror reflection not only transforms the K point into the K' point
but also reverses the direction of the magnetic field to maintain the
symmetry. This is most clearly seen in (REF ), as we shall
discuss later. Consequently, the K and K' points become physically
distinguishable.
Electrons make cyclotron motion in magnetic field. The helicity is no longer
a good variable, since there exists a special direction for the spin, that
is, the direction of magnetic field. In this case it is convenient to use
the standard representation for the Dirac matrices, where
FORMULA 
In order to discuss the QHE, we solve the quantum mechanical problem with
the Hamiltonian (REF ) in each Dirac valley,
FORMULA 
and we expand the field operator in terms of the new eigenfunctions.
To solve the eigen equation (REF ) we express the Hamiltonian (REF ) as
FORMULA 
with the use of (REF ) for FORMULA , where
FORMULA 
It is diagonalized as
FORMULA 
We introduce a pair of operators
FORMULA 
satisfying FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the
magnetic length. Since the operators (REF ) is rewritten as
FORMULA 
with FORMULA , the diagonalized
Hamiltonian reads
FORMULA 
Since FORMULA  is the number operator, the eigenvalue of the Dirac
Hamiltonian FORMULA  follows immediately,
FORMULA 
with the eigenstate
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .
The operators FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the Landau-level ladder operators.
Hence, FORMULA  in (REF ) represents the Landau-level index. We
have found that the energy of an electron in the FORMULA th Landau level is
either FORMULA  or FORMULA . It is
curious that the energy of an electron in the lowest Landau level (FORMULA ) is
zero though it performs cyclotron motion. This puzzle is solved in the
succeeding subsection.

Pauli Hamiltonian
To reveal the intrinsic structure of the energy spectrum, we investigate the
Hamiltonian{{cite:f5c0fc8f-ce8e-4558-a381-92530658cca5}}, {{cite:5256ee5c-57d3-41e0-8257-37f1a2a8993f}}, {{cite:6aaac83c-6b92-4975-88ad-88d5bd7fb6fc}}, {{cite:938137f4-4e33-46c0-b001-44171fc4cb08}}
FORMULA 
which is the building blocks of the Dirac Hamiltonian (REF ).
Here, the direction of the magnetic field is found to be effectively
opposite at the K and K' points. Since this has the same form as the Pauli
Hamiltonian with the mass FORMULA  except for the
dimension, we call it the Pauli Hamiltonian for brevity. The salient feature
of the relativistic Dirac Hamiltonian is that its spectrum is
mapped from that of the nonrelativistic Pauli Hamiltonian. Thus,
the energy eigenvalue FORMULA  of the Dirac Hamiltonian FORMULA  is constructed as FORMULA  from the energy eigenvalue FORMULA  of the Pauli
Hamiltonian FORMULA .
In the Pauli Hamiltonian (REF ), the first term is the kinetic
term while the second term is the Zeeman term. It is fixed uniquely as an
intrinsic property of the Dirac theory: We call it the intrinsic Zeeman
effect.
The Landau level is created by electrons making cyclotron motion. In the
conventional QHE, since the Zeeman energy can be considered much smaller
than the Landau-level separation, we may treat it as a perturbation.
However, this is not the case in graphene. According to the Pauli
Hamiltonian (REF ), the intrinsic Zeeman energy is precisely one
half of the cyclotron energy for Dirac electrons, and two Landau levels mix
to create one energy level, as illustrated in Fig.REF (a).
We consider the K point (FORMULA ). It is obvious that the up-spin and
down-spin states are eigenstates of the Pauli Hamiltonian (REF )
and hence eigenstates of the Dirac Hamiltonian (REF ), and that
the up-spin state has a lower energy than the down-spin state when they
belong to the same Landau level. On the other hand, the direction of the
spin is opposite at the K and K' points. Hence, we can make the following
identification of quantum numbers for electrons in the FORMULA th level (FORMULA ) of the energy spectrum [Fig.REF (a)],
FORMULA 
A similar identification can be made for holes in the FORMULA th energy level (FORMULA ) . The zeroth energy level (FORMULA ) consists of the up-spin electron
and the down-spin hole at the K point, and the down-spin electron and the
up-spin hole at the K' point [Fig.REF (a)], coming from the
lowest Landau levels for electrons and holes.
Counting the states at the K and K' points all together, one energy level
has a 4-fold degeneracy. Each filled energy level contributes one
conductance quantum FORMULA  to the Hall conductivity. Consequently
the resulting series is FORMULA , which accounts
for the bold-face series (REF ) in the monolayer graphene.

Field Operators
We focus on electrons in the FORMULA th energy level. (Essentially the same
analysis is applicable to holes.) We start with the quantum-mechanical state
in a single Landau level. We decompose the electron coordinate FORMULA  into the guiding center FORMULA  and the relative
coordinate FORMULA , FORMULA ,
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  with FORMULA 
the covariant momentum. They satisfy the commutation relations FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA . We define a set of operators FORMULA , FORMULA  by
FORMULA 
obeying FORMULA , in addition to a set of operators FORMULA , FORMULA 
by (REF ). The quantum-mechanical states are the Fock states,
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  the Fock vacuum, FORMULA .
We have constructed the energy spectrum of the Dirac Hamiltonian (REF ) in each Dirac valley, as illustrated in Fig.REF (a). The FORMULA th energy level (FORMULA ) contains electrons
coming from two Dirac valleys (FORMULA ), whose field operators are
expanded in terms of the eigenfunctions. Corresponding to FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  in (REF ), we have
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the annihilation operator acting on the
Fock state FORMULA  at the FORMULA  point. In what follows we suppress
the Landau-level index FORMULA  in FORMULA  with the
understanding that FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA . See (REF ) with respect to the factor FORMULA . The electron operators in the zeroth energy level are given by FORMULA  and FORMULA 
with FORMULA .

Coulomb Interactions
We make the basic assumption that the cyclotron energy is much larger than
the Coulomb energy as in the conventional QHE{{cite:d07e794d-b650-4759-8b37-3315322682f2}}, {{cite:57df128c-dca5-450e-a7eb-7df7594d5fda}}, {{cite:e1175dac-9745-49b8-95f8-c263fe58ffd6}}. We neglect the Landau-level mixing by
the Coulomb interaction, and analyze it within one energy level [Fig.REF (a)]. There exists a consistent formalism, known as the
Landau-level projection. The projected theory presents not only a good
approximation but also an essential way to reveal a new physics inherent to
the QH system{{cite:d07e794d-b650-4759-8b37-3315322682f2}}, {{cite:57df128c-dca5-450e-a7eb-7df7594d5fda}}, {{cite:e1175dac-9745-49b8-95f8-c263fe58ffd6}}. Then we may treat the
electron system, the hole system and the zero-energy system independently of
each other. The hole system has the same structure as the electron system
due to the electron-hole symmetry. On the other hand, the zero-energy system
contains both electrons and holes. We study the electron system in this
section, and the zero-energy system of electrons and holes in Section .
Assuming all lower levels are filled up, we study the Coulomb interaction
between electrons confined within the FORMULA th energy level (FORMULA ). The
Coulomb Hamiltonian reads
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the density operator
FORMULA 
The Landau-level projection of the Coulomb Hamiltonian (REF )
is a simple generalization of the lowest-Landau-level projection{{cite:d740e25a-95bd-41e9-bad8-d3267dc3718c}} familiar in the conventional QHE. We require the density
operator to be comprised solely of the electron fields belonging to the FORMULA th energy level. Thus, from (REF ) we construct the projected
density operator FORMULA  by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the field operator (REF ). As we show in Appendix , the projected
density operator is rewritten in the momentum space as
FORMULA 
where FORMULA 
is the bare density operator{{cite:c584ddd0-7e98-4772-acb7-f8a6983dbff0}},
FORMULA 
and FORMULA  is the
form factor,
FORMULA 
with
FORMULA 
Here we have used the relation, FORMULA , due to
the lattice structure. It should be remarked that the bare density operator FORMULA 
involves only the guiding center coordinate FORMULA , while the form
factor FORMULA 
involves only the relative coordinate FORMULA .
The form factors are explicitly given by using{{cite:067baa92-7279-4da5-b91e-af57abb115d7}}
FORMULA 
for FORMULA  in terms of associated Laguerre polynomials.
A comment is in order on the form factors. It is easy to see that{{cite:0792b923-5950-4ecc-8721-e4074a235b62}}
FORMULA 
Thus, FORMULA  is exponentially smaller than FORMULA . For instance, FORMULA  represents the
transfer of the up-spin electron (FORMULA ) from the K' point (FORMULA ) to the K point (FORMULA ). Hence, such a mixing between the K and
K' points is actually negligible.
FIGURE 
The projected Coulomb Hamiltonian is constructed by substituting the
projected density (REF ) into the Hamiltonian (REF ),
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the effective Coulomb potential in the FORMULA th
energy level,
FORMULA 
with
FORMULA 
It is remarkable that the effective Coulomb potential depends on the spin
and the valley through the form factors FORMULA  characterizing Landau levels.
The typical effective Coulomb potentials in the FORMULA th energy level at the K
point are
FORMULA 
The potential FORMULA  stands for
the interaction between electrons with the same spin FORMULA , FORMULA  for the interaction
between electrons with the different spin. The spin direction is reversed at
the K' point. We have illustrated the effective Coulomb potentials in Figs.REF  and REF .
FIGURE 
We note that the effective potential FORMULA  for electrons with the same spin in the FORMULA th energy
level has precisely the same form as in the standard QHE for electrons in
the FORMULA th Landau level: Compare Fig.REF (a) with Fig.7 in Ref.{{cite:3d71a4c1-1b09-4af9-82dc-6eb4460582b6}}. On the other hand the effective potential FORMULA  for electrons with the different
spins are entirely new.

Excitonic Condensation
It is necessary to pay a special attention to the zero-energy level (FORMULA ),
since it contains both electrons and holes. Let us recapture the properties
of the zero-energy level [Fig.REF ]. In the absence of the
magnetic field the band structure is given by the Dirac valleys associated
with the dispersion relation (REF ), as illustrated in Fig.REF (a). When the magnetic field is applied, the band structure
is changed to generate Landau levels [Fig.REF (b)]. However,
the Dirac electron is subject to the intrinsic Zeeman effect, which induces
a Landau-level mixing, and the zero-energy state emerges for up-spin
electrons as well as down-spin holes [Fig.REF (c)]. There
exists an attractive Coulomb force between an electron and a hole. Hence we
expect them to make an excitonic condensation, producing a gap to the
electron and hole states [Fig.REF (d)].
FIGURE 
The excitonic condensation in graphene has been studied in various contexts{{cite:2aaf425f-3e5c-4e4f-9ea8-555c383bc28b}}, {{cite:7fcc1194-f0c7-4604-96f2-28f0ed8e9627}}, {{cite:c8b6cd87-fb6c-486d-a0b3-9024311c39a2}}, {{cite:8f4796d9-ad51-40cc-ab8a-b8ceefd09140}}. Here, we
present a clear-cut approach to this problem on the analogy of the BCS
theory. Our physical picture is summarized in Fig.REF . The
remarkable point is that the kinetic term is quenched in each Landau level,
and hence it is also absent in the zero-energy level. This simplifies
considerably our analysis.
The field operators present in the zero-energy level are FORMULA , FORMULA 
for electrons and FORMULA , FORMULA  for holes coming from the FORMULA  Landau
levels [Fig.REF (a)]. It is sufficient to investigate
electron-hole pairs at the K and K' points separately. An exciton composed
of an electron and a hole belonging to different valleys is fragile, because
their effective Coulomb potential involves the factor FORMULA  compared with the one within the K point: See () and (REF ). For definiteness, we consider the
K point [Fig.REF ].
The effective Coulomb potential (REF ) is simple in the
lowest Landau level,
FORMULA 
We consider the effective Hamiltonian together with this effective
potential,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the up-spin electron field and the
down-spin hole field, respectively. The Hamiltonian is rewritten as
FORMULA 
Here and here after, under the symbol FORMULA , the integration over momentum
variables is understood.
We derive the gap equation, following the analysis familiar in the BCS
theory. We take the terms satisfying FORMULA  as the dominant ones, and approximate the Hamiltonian as
FORMULA 
We define the singlet excitonic gap function by
FORMULA 
which can be taken to be positive without loss of generality.
The mean-field Hamiltonian reads
FORMULA 
By setting
FORMULA 
it is easy to diagonalize (REF ) as
FORMULA 
Since FORMULA  and FORMULA  are free fields, the ground state is given
by solving
FORMULA 
or
FORMULA 
This is a BCS-type state representing the condensation of electron-hole
pairs.
Due to the Fermi statistics the thermodynamical average FORMULA  is given by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the Boltzmann factor. Combining these with () we obtain
FORMULA 
Substituting this into (REF ) we derive the gap equation,
FORMULA 
In the limit FORMULA , the zero-momentum gap FORMULA  is given by the dispersionless relation
FORMULA 
For finite temperature, assuming the gap is dispersionless, we obtain the
relation
FORMULA 
The critical temperature FORMULA  at which FORMULA  is solved
as FORMULA .
According to the diagonalized Hamiltonian (REF ), the excitonic
condensation provides them with the mass FORMULA , resolving the
electron-hole degeneracy in the zero-energy state. Combining the results at
the K and K' points, the 4-fold degenerate levels split into two 2-fold
degenerate levels [Fig.REF (d)] with the gap energy (REF ). This leads to a new plateau at FORMULA , as illustrated in Fig. REF

Valley Polarization
It is now possible to treat electrons and holes separately since the gap has
opened between the electron and hole bands. Furthermore, it is enough to
study only electrons due to the electron-hole symmetry. We show that the
Coulomb effect modifies the energy spectrum of the noninteracting theory so
that plateaux emerges at FORMULA  with FORMULA  [Fig.REF ].
FIGURE 
We express the Coulomb Hamiltonian (REF ) as
FORMULA 
where the summations over repeated indices, FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  are understood, and
FORMULA 
We introduce
FORMULA 
They represent the direct and exchange Coulomb energies, respectively. It is
easy to evaluate them numerically: See Fig.REF (a) for FORMULA . We analyze the lowest energy level and higher energy levels
separately.
Lowest Energy Level
We first study the lowest energy level, which contain two degenerate states
[Fig.REF (b)]. The degeneracy is resolved obviously by a strong
extrinsic Zeeman effect if it exists. We consider the case where the
extrinsic Zeeman energy is absent at temperature FORMULA , or is present but
quite small compared with the thermal energy at FORMULA . We ask whether
the degeneracy is resolved even in such cases.
As a generic trial function we take
FORMULA 
with FORMULA . The state covers the entire SU(2) space of the
lowest energy level for electrons, when the two parameters FORMULA  and FORMULA  are
varied.
FIGURE 
We calculate the Coulomb energy FORMULA  with (REF ). Most terms are SU(2)
invariant, but there exists a noninvariant term,
FORMULA 
Hence the SU(2) symmetry is broken explicitly into the U(1) symmetry by
Coulomb interactions.
The energy is minimized either FORMULA  or FORMULA  due to the term (REF ), corresponding to the state
FORMULA 
The ground state is either FORMULA  or FORMULA , though there exists still the ZFORMULA  symmetry.
The energy barrier is of the order of the Coulomb energy, which is much
larger than the thermal energy.
We conclude as follows: The two levels split explicitly by an extrinsic
Zeeman effect if exits. Then the first energy level is up-spin polarized,
and the second energy level is down-spin polarized. Even without such an
extrinsic Zeeman effect, driven by the Coulomb exchange interaction, the
spontaneous breakdown of the ZFORMULA  symmetry turns the system into a QH
ferromagnet{{cite:57df128c-dca5-450e-a7eb-7df7594d5fda}}, {{cite:e1175dac-9745-49b8-95f8-c263fe58ffd6}}. It is reasonable to call it the
Ising QH ferromagnet due to the ZFORMULA  symmetry. In any case, a plateau
emerges at FORMULA , where the activation energy is of the order of the
typical Coulomb energy as in the conventional QHE{{cite:57df128c-dca5-450e-a7eb-7df7594d5fda}}, {{cite:e1175dac-9745-49b8-95f8-c263fe58ffd6}}.

FORMULA th Energy Level
We next study the FORMULA th energy level with FORMULA . It contains four
degenerate states with the SU(4) symmetry in noninteracting theory. However,
the projected density is invariant only under U(1)FORMULA U(1)FORMULA ZFORMULA . Hence we take a set of trial functions by requiring this symmetry,
FORMULA 
where the phase factors FORMULA  and FORMULA  assure the U(1)FORMULA U(1) symmetry. These two states are
degenerate, FORMULA , due to the ZFORMULA  symmetry.
It is easy to determine the angle FORMULA  by minimizing the Coulomb
energy FORMULA .
After some calculations we find
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
with (REF ). Here, FORMULA  since FORMULA . Furthermore, because of (REF ), FORMULA  and FORMULA  are exponentially smaller in FORMULA  than FORMULA  or FORMULA , and can
be neglected. Hence
FORMULA 
Now it follows from () that FORMULA . We can also see [Fig.REF (a)]
FORMULA 
implying that the Coulomb energy of an electron in higher Landau level is
lower. It follows that
FORMULA 
We have depicted FORMULA  as a function of FORMULA  in Fig.REF (b).
We conclude that, if we take the state FORMULA ,
more electrons are present in the Dirac valley at the K point than at the K'
point since FORMULA . Namely, the valley
polarization has occurred both in FORMULA  and FORMULA . This can be understood physically as
follows [Fig.REF (a)]: Up-spin electrons in the K point
belong to the (FORMULA -1)th Landau level but those in the K' point belong to
the FORMULA th Landau level. It is easier to fill Landau sites at the K point
because the Coulomb energy is lower in higher Landau levels. The valley
polarization disappears as FORMULA , since FORMULA  in the limit [Fig.REF (b)].
An extrinsic Zeeman effect open a gap between these two spin polarized
states. Even without such an effect, driven by the Coulomb exchange
interaction, the spontaneous breakdown of the ZFORMULA  symmetry turns the
system into a QH ferromagnet. Note that it has still the 2-fold degeneracy.
In any case, a plateau emerges at FORMULA  [Fig.REF (c)], where
the activation energy is of the order of the typical Coulomb energy as in
the conventional QHE{{cite:57df128c-dca5-450e-a7eb-7df7594d5fda}}, {{cite:e1175dac-9745-49b8-95f8-c263fe58ffd6}}.

Multilayer Graphene Systems
Bilayer Graphene (Bernal Stacking)
We proceed to generalize the above analysis to a bilayer graphene, which is
a system made of two coupled hexagonal lattices according to the Bernal
stacking. In the absence of magnetic field, the low-energy spectrum of the
bilayer graphene is known{{cite:bc956f0c-c15a-4c85-b2b6-c6a4aa48996f}}, {{cite:2d621172-c9a5-4eea-ba02-4d3bf4b6a66d}}, {{cite:f69a7d06-4e57-4242-811d-47e1e0122477}}, {{cite:9f7645f0-0062-41c2-9769-ee648dd8d059}} to be parabolic,
FORMULA 
near the K and K' points. In the presence of the magnetic field, we can
reformulate the model Hamiltonian{{cite:2d621172-c9a5-4eea-ba02-4d3bf4b6a66d}}, {{cite:f69a7d06-4e57-4242-811d-47e1e0122477}}, {{cite:9f7645f0-0062-41c2-9769-ee648dd8d059}} as the
generalized Dirac Hamiltonian defined by
FORMULA 
together with
FORMULA 
Here, FORMULA , with FORMULA  given by (REF ). We
also consider the generalized Pauli Hamiltonian
FORMULA 
We may switch off the magnetic field in this formula, and reproduce the
energy spectrum (REF ).
The eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian FORMULA  is derived as
FORMULA 
with the eigenstate FORMULA ,
where
FORMULA 
for FORMULA , as illustrated in Fig.REF . It is interesting
that two Landau levels mix to create one nonzero-energy level, but that four
Landau levels mix to create the zero-energy level. Thus there exists the
4-fold degeneracy in the nonzero-energy level but the 8-fold degeneracy in
the zero-energy state, as results in the bold-face series (REF ).
This agrees with the previous result{{cite:bc956f0c-c15a-4c85-b2b6-c6a4aa48996f}}, {{cite:2d621172-c9a5-4eea-ba02-4d3bf4b6a66d}}, {{cite:f69a7d06-4e57-4242-811d-47e1e0122477}}.
FIGURE 
We include Coulomb interactions. The FORMULA th energy level (FORMULA ) has the
same structure as in the monolayer graphene system. Coulomb interactions
make each energy level split into two subbands.
We discuss the zero-energy state in some details. There are electron-hole
pairs coming from the FORMULA  Landau level and the FORMULA  Landau level for
electrons and holes [Fig.REF (b)]. At the K point there are four
gap functions FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are creation operators of electrons in the FORMULA th Landau
level and holes in the FORMULA th Landau level, respectively. Repeating
similar analysis we have made in Section , we solve the gap
equations at FORMULA  as
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is given by (REF ); FORMULA . Thus, the 8-fold degenerate
zero-energy level splits into four 2-fold degenerated subbands, producing
plateaux at FORMULA . Furthermore we have Ising QH ferromagnets at
FORMULA . Consequently, we predict the full series (REF ).

Trilayer Graphene (Rhombohedral Stacking)
The above analysis is applicable also to a trilayer graphene with the ABC
stacking (rhombohedral stacking). In the absence of the magnetic field, the
low-energy spectrum of trilayer graphene has been argued{{cite:f69a7d06-4e57-4242-811d-47e1e0122477}} to be
cubic,
FORMULA 
near the K and K' points. In the presence of the magnetic field, we can
reformulate the model Hamiltonian{{cite:f69a7d06-4e57-4242-811d-47e1e0122477}} as the generalized Dirac
Hamiltonian as
FORMULA 
together with
FORMULA 
Here, FORMULA , where FORMULA  given by (REF ).
The eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian FORMULA  is derived as in (REF ) with
FORMULA 
for FORMULA , as illustrated in Fig.REF . There exists the
4-fold degeneracy in the nonzero-energy level but the 12-fold degeneracy in
the zero-energy state, as results in the bold-face series (REF ).
This agrees with the previous result{{cite:f69a7d06-4e57-4242-811d-47e1e0122477}}.
FIGURE 
We briefly argue how the energy spectrum is modified by Coulomb
interactions. The effective Coulomb potential depends on the spin and the
valley degree of freedom precisely by the same mechanism. The FORMULA th energy
level (FORMULA ) has the same structure as in the monolayer graphene
system. Hence, each energy level splits into two subbands. The ground state
is describe by a formula similar to (REF ), where the valley
polarization is occurred. There are electron-hole pairs in the zero-energy
state, which make excitonic condensation by the same mechanism as in the
monolayer and bilayer cases. Thus, the 12-fold degenerate zero-energy level
splits into six 2-fold degenerated subbands, producing plateaux at FORMULA . Furthermore we have Ising QH ferromagnets at FORMULA . Consequently, we predict the full series (REF ).

Discussions
The most intriguing property of the graphene system is that the intrinsic
Zeeman energy is precisely one half of the cyclotron energy for electrons
and holes. It leads to the symmetry group SU(4) in the noninteracting
theory, where the Hall plateau emerges at FORMULA .
This series is the first experimental result{{cite:a89c73a7-9eb9-4669-8642-8483f7333570}} of the QHE in
graphene. When Coulomb interactions are included, the symmetry SU(4) is
broken so that the Hall plateau emerges at FORMULA . This series has been found experimentally{{cite:928ca9bb-c06b-4c30-bd8d-868d90e8e884}} when larger
magnetic field is applied. We have shown that the Ising QH ferromagnets
appear at FORMULA  due to a BCS-type condensation of electron-hole pairs.
We have emphasized that one energy level contains up-spin and down-spin
electrons coming from two neighboring Landau levels. Since Coulomb
interactions are different for electrons in different Landau levels, we have
derived a remarkable consequence that the effective Coulomb potential
depends on the spin and the valley degree of freedom [Figs.REF  and REF ]. As a result, the valley polarization is
occurred on the ground state. We wish to explore new physics associated with
this peculiar Coulomb interaction in forthcoming papers.

Dirac Electrons in Graphene
In this appendix, we derive the second-quantized Dirac Hamiltonian (REF ) together with (REF ) for electrons in graphene.
We start with a study on the quantum-mechanical states of electrons based on
the FORMULA  approximation{{cite:5f9fa789-a16f-4eb1-b07a-19c110baf0db}}, {{cite:0ffab13d-8fc2-45a2-a8cb-1cd5fe2bec44}}.
First of all, the wave functions FORMULA  are given in
terms of envelope functions FORMULA  as{{cite:5b3e1d53-a443-430d-9d0b-b4f2935095d5}}
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the site index (FORMULA AFORMULA B) and FORMULA  is the valley index (FORMULA K,K'). The envelope functions are normalized as FORMULA  for FORMULA AFORMULA B.
They satisfy the Schrödinger equation{{cite:5b3e1d53-a443-430d-9d0b-b4f2935095d5}}
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the eigenvalue, and the Hamiltonian FORMULA  is the FORMULA  matrix operator,
FORMULA 
with FORMULA . Since this is block diagonal, it is
convenient to set
FORMULA 
with FORMULA . Note that FORMULA , where FORMULA  is
the generator of the mirror symmetry. The eigenfunctions of FORMULA  (FORMULA K,K') are given by{{cite:5b3e1d53-a443-430d-9d0b-b4f2935095d5}}
FORMULA 
with the eigenvalue FORMULA , where FORMULA  stands for the helicity, FORMULA . Note that FORMULA  is the momentum of electrons,
FORMULA  measured from the K or K' point.
Let us explain the notations we have used in () and (REF ). We
recall that the FORMULA  is the helicity operator except
for the positive normalization factor. Thus, FORMULA  has the positive helicity and a positive energy, while FORMULA  has the negative helicity and a negative
energy. Since the energy and the helicity have the same sign for the
envelope function FORMULA , it
describes the right-handed Weyl fermion by definition. Hence we have put the
index "R". Similarly we have assigned the right-handed Weyl fermion at the
K' point.
There are only four independent two-component envelope functions given by (REF ) with FORMULA K,K' and FORMULA . However, there are more
quantum-mechanical states for electrons. They are the chiral symmetric
copies; the left-handed Weyl fermions FORMULA  at the K point and FORMULA  at the K' point. The corresponding Hamiltonians and envelope functions
are constructed by the chiral transformation generated by the Pauli matrix FORMULA  as FORMULA , FORMULA , and
FORMULA 
Note the the energy and the helicity have the opposite sign for the
left-handed Weyl fermion.
The energy spectrum is symmetric between the positive and negative energy
states. There exists one electron per one carbon and the band-filling factor
is 1/2 in graphene. Namely, all negative-energy states are filled up, as is
a reminiscence of the Dirac sea. Hence, we have electrons and holes as
physical excitations.
In this way there are eight types of quantum-mechanical states for electrons
in graphene, corresponding to the spin degree of freedom (FORMULA ),
the electron-hole degree of freedom and the valley degree of freedom (FORMULA K,K'). To carry out the second quantization it is necessary to use all
these quantum-mechanical states together with the four Hamiltonians. We
arrange them as FORMULA , FORMULA  where we have introduced the Dirac FORMULA 
matrix in the Weyl representation,
FORMULA 
They are summarized into the Dirac Hamiltonian (REF ) in text,
or
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  (FORMULA ) for the K (K') point.
According to the standard prescription the second-quantized Hamiltonian is
constructed as in (REF ), or FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the quantum
mechanical Hamiltonian. The field operator is expanded as FORMULA , with
FORMULA 
We have introduced the annihilation operator FORMULA  of an electron with the eigenfunction FORMULA , and the creation operator FORMULA  of a hole with the eigenfunction FORMULA , where we have set FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  in accord with the standard
notation in the Dirac theory. In passing, the field operator FORMULA  for electrons in graphene is to be constructed with the use of
the wavefuncion (REF ), and hence is given by (REF ) in
text.

Landau-Level Projection
In this appendix we derive the formula (REF ) for the projected
density operator FORMULA . We first review how the
Landau-level projection is made in the conventional QHE, where the density
operator is given by FORMULA  We consider electrons confined to the FORMULA th Landau level,
where Fock states are given by (REF ). The field operator is
expanded as
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  the annihilation operator of electrons acting on the state FORMULA , FORMULA . The projected
density operator is
FORMULA 
Its Fourier transformation is
FORMULA 
Here, we decompose the coordinate into the guiding center and the relative
coordinate, FORMULA , where FORMULA  and FORMULA  act on the Fock states FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
respectively. Since they commute each other, we obtain
FORMULA 
or FORMULA , with
FORMULA 
We call FORMULA  the Landau-level form factor, and FORMULA  the bare density operator.
In the graphene QHE one energy level contain four different types of
electrons described by (REF ). For instance, the projected
density operator for up-spin electrons is given by
FORMULA 
where the summation over the indices FORMULA  and FORMULA  is understood. By repeating
the above process, this reads
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
A similarly formula is derived also for FORMULA . Adding FORMULA  and FORMULA  we obtain (REF ) in text.
