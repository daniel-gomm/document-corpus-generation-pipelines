It is proposed that radiation belts similar to the ones in the planetary
magnetosphere can exist for a pulsar with a relatively long period and a
strong magnetic field. In the belts located in the closed
field line region near the light cylinder relativistic pairs
are trapped and maintained at a density substantially higher than the
local Goldreich-Julian corotation density. The trapped plasma can be supplied
and replenished by either direct injection of relativistic pairs from acceleration
of externally-supplied particles in a dormant outer gap or in situ ionization
of the accreted neutral material in the trapping region. The radiation belts can be disrupted by
waves that are excited in the region as the result of plasma instabilities or emitted from the surface
due to starquakes or stellar oscillations. The disruption can cause an intermittent
particle precipitation toward the star producing radio bursts. It is suggested that
such bursts may be seen as rotating radio transients (RRATs).
pulsar – particle acceleration – radiation mechanism: nonthermal
Introduction
The recent discovery of a new class of
radio transient sources, known as rotating radio transients (RRATS)
{{cite:3ce1c8fc-1cbb-4656-9108-79e19cfa7ab6}}, suggests that radio transient phenomena may be
quite common for typical pulsars. About 11 such sources have been detected so far;
they are characterized by short outbursts of a typical from 2 to 30 millisecond duration
with an average interval between two consective bursts from a few minutes
to a few hours. Ten RRATs have their periodicities determined and three of them
have their period derivatives identified. Observations appear to suggest that these objects
are part of the normal pulsar population, with periods of a few seconds, within the period
range of typical radio pulsars, and magnetic fields up to FORMULA ,
close to a lower limit of the magnetic field of the known magnetars.
No transient X-rays or optical counter part has been observed, though
thermal X-ray emission was detected from one RRAT, which appears to
be similar to X-ray dim isolated neutron stars
(XDINS) {{cite:6267ed07-aa40-47bc-a0ed-7e33cb17945c}}, {{cite:08d8b5f8-9bd2-4067-b809-b256c5cd6b93}}.
Three RRATs with both periods and period derivatives
identified overlap with normal radio pulsars in the FORMULA -FORMULA  (pulsar
period vs period derivative) distribution,
which strongly suggests that RRATs may have similar properties to radio pulsars and should
have normal radio emission as well. However, regular radio pulses have not been detected
from any of these sources, suggesting that either (1) these radio bursts are distinct
from the normal radio emission in aspects of emission geometry or processes or (2)
normal radio pulses are too weak to be detectable {{cite:f54c6071-f204-4ff1-9ab7-3ca47d52ec26}}.
For case (1), one could postulate, for example, that radio emission
jumps between two alternative beaming direction, one of which intersects
the Earth. For case (2), RRATs may be considered as extreme pulses and
the `missing' normal radio pulses can be detected with a sufficiently
long observing time {{cite:f54c6071-f204-4ff1-9ab7-3ca47d52ec26}}. {{cite:f54c6071-f204-4ff1-9ab7-3ca47d52ec26}}, {{cite:279c2f17-6cf0-41e5-a096-a2ba005cb231}} specifically
considered PSR B0656+14, which is a nearby pulsar that has
pulsed X-rays and intense bursty radio pulses similar to RRATs.
They suggested that if this pulsar were at a distance
similar to that RRATs, one would see the strong radio bursts as RRATs and its
normal radio emission becomes nondetectable.
If RRATs are indeed pulsars, one has a major difficulty in interpretation of
the observed intense radio bursts on the basis of conventional polar cap models because
most of RRATs have long periods and pair production is not effective.
{{cite:61b6ce77-4887-4e5d-a6f1-02ae6ac903c1}} proposed that the bursty emission by RRATs is due to
circumpulsar asteroids randomly straying into the magnetosphere; the
neutral material is evaporated and ionized, leading to a sudden downward flow of
charged particles in the polar region, which in turn ignites a transient pair cascade toward
the PC. The low-mass disk hypothesis has some observational support from the recent
discovery of the fall-back disk of a magnetar, cf. {{cite:981e85fd-cc0d-4bf3-809a-3c3325819b8c}}. One main ingredient of
the Cordes & Shannon's model is that a cascade is assumed to be due to acceleration in the outer
gap. However, RRATs are in the regime in the FORMULA -FORMULA  distribution
where the outer gap is inactive for pair production (through photon-photon
collision) except for the case of a nearly orthogonal inclination angle where the
outer gap may form close to the PC and pair production through a single photon decay
in the magnetic field is important. In this latter case,
the cascade has to be close to the PC and backward emission from the cascade
may not be able to propagate freely through the intervening plasma near
the star in the closed field line region (CFLR)
where induced three-wave interactions are expected to be strong {{cite:6ff56464-7796-49f6-baec-66de9ccb5a18}}.
In this paper, we propose that typical pulsars may have radiation belts
in the CFLR where relativistic plasmas are trapped.
The trapping regions bear many similarities to the Earth's radiation belts.
For example, they are similarly subject to various low-frequency disturbances that disrupt
the trapped plasma causing intense precipitation. While in the case of the Earth's van Allen belts,
which are subject to disruption by geomagnetic storms due to the solar wind,
the proposed main disturbances to the
pulsar's radiation belts are low-frequency Alfvén waves generated from the star's surface as a
result of stellar oscillations {{cite:e3418120-56cd-4c0c-bb32-6af30128b3ed}} or shear waves in the neutron star's crust
due to starquakes {{cite:c5a5ae3f-30c0-4772-92e3-5e1ce6e2e255}}. It is suggested
here that transient radio emission similar to RRATs can be generated as a result of
catastrophic disruption of the trapping region and that the coherent emission is produced
by particles precipitating toward the star.
The density of the trapped plasma can be maintained at a much higher value
than the local GJ density. In the trapping region the magnetic
field is relatively weak and the synchrotron decay time is long so that the
plasma can be replenished, leading to a build-up in the density.
The major sources of the trapped plasma can be particle acceleration in a dormant
outer gap or ablation and ionization of the accreted neutral matter.
We assume that low-level accretion of neutral grains from a dust disk or from
the ISM occurs and that the accreted matter is ionized inside the LC
feeding charged particles directly to both the open field line region
(OFLR) {{cite:ec987fc3-2a5e-4618-9f06-59b8014716ed}}, {{cite:ef13c7b4-5319-4199-933c-9fdca639fdf6}}, {{cite:61b6ce77-4887-4e5d-a6f1-02ae6ac903c1}} and CFLR {{cite:61b6ce77-4887-4e5d-a6f1-02ae6ac903c1}}. Note that there were
also previous discussions on accretion of neutral material from the ISM and
possible effects on radio emission by ionization of the neutral matter in
the pulsar magnetosphere {{cite:eb16e2bb-eb34-48f2-8560-5336fe98a854}}, {{cite:608b4d50-afef-4bfa-bb89-dbb01ac1bfef}}. Charged particles created from
destruction and ionization of neutral material in the CFLR can accumulate and
be trapped in the region. Charged particles created in the OFLR can be
accelerated in the outer gap and inject relativistic pairs into
the trapping region. High-energy gamma rays emitted by
the accelerated particles produce pairs in the trapping region
on the thermal radiation emitted from the surface. The pair production rate
is rather slow, but provided that it exceeds the loss rate,
it can accumulate plasma near the LC in the CFLR.
Note that reignition of a latent outer gap was discussed by {{cite:ef13c7b4-5319-4199-933c-9fdca639fdf6}}
in the context of gamma-ray bursts. However, they considered nearly aligned rotators
with a period much shorter than that considered here. In their model,
injection of externally-supplied particles in the outer gap
is assumed to lead to efficient pair creation, a case that does not apply
to RRATs or magnetars.
In Sec. 2, it is argued that plasma trapping regions
similar to the Earth's radiation belts can exist in the CFLR of typical pulsars
with a long period. Injection of charged particles to the trapping region
due to latent particle acceleration in an outer gap or direct ionization of accreted
neutral dust grains is discussed in Sec. 3 and 4.
Sec. 5 discusses the stability of the pulsar radiation belts and possible
mechanisms for particle precipitation. Application to RRATs is discussed
in Sec. 6.

Radiation belts
It is argued here that radiation belts similar to that in planetary
magnetospheres may exist in pulsar magnetospheres with relatively weak magnetic
fields at the LC.
Magnetic mirror
Particles injected with nonzero perpendicular
momenta can be trapped in the CFLR due to the magnetic mirror
effect. For a particle with a perpendicular momentum FORMULA , the first
adiabatic invariant can be expressed as FORMULA . In this section,
we ignore the loss of perpendicular energy due to cyclotron decay, which can be important
for pulsars and is considered in Sec. 2.2. From a quantum mechanical view point, this corresponds to
a particle remaining in the same Landau level. The magnetic field in the CFLR
forms a `magnetic bottle' and particles injected at a radial height FORMULA 
(FORMULA  is the radius in unit of FORMULA )
can be trapped at FORMULA  provided that their perpendicular momenta satisfy the condition:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  with FORMULA  the parallel momentum.
For example, particles injected with FORMULA  at the LC
(FORMULA ) can be trapped; they bounce back and forth between two opposite hemispheres
in the CLFR above FORMULA . The right-hand side can be written into the
form FORMULA , where the angle FORMULA  defines a conal surface
in the momentum space, referred to as the loss cone at FORMULA . Particles
with a pitch angle smaller than FORMULA  (inside the cone) pass through the point FORMULA 
and those with a pitch angle larger than FORMULA  (outside the cone) are reflected above FORMULA .
For particles moving along the last closed field lines, the typical bounce
time is (cf. Appendix)
FORMULA 
which is not sensitive to the particle's initial pitch angle FORMULA 
at the injection but required to satisfy the condition
FORMULA 
i.e., the reflection radius must be above the stellar radius.
Eq (REF ) is much smaller than the minimum loss-cone angle
of the van Allen belts in the Earth's magnetosphere, which is a few degrees.
However, it is shown in Sec 2.2 that the minimum loss-cone angle determmined
by cylcotron decay can be much larger than (REF ).
Since the dipole magnetic field is inhomogeneous, the guiding centers of trapped particles
undergo both a gradient drift and curvature drift across the field lines {{cite:bc9b1f82-6c7a-4b24-84af-0bcb647db982}}.
These drifts cause particles to circulate around the star forming a ring current,
similar to the ring current in the Earth's radiation belts. The current gives
rise to perturbations to the dipole field at FORMULA :
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the magnetic energy density at the LC, FORMULA ,
FORMULA  is the half-opening angle of the PC,
and FORMULA 
is the GJ density at the PC where the magnetic field is assumed to be FORMULA .
In practical situations where the plasma density can be much higher than the GJ density (Sec 3),
the perturbations can exceed the estimate given by (REF ).
Since the ring current can vary temporally as a result of instabilities in the trapped plasma
(cf. Sec 5), FORMULA  should be time dependent. The effect of such perturbations on
pulsar electrodynamics and their possible contribution to
pulsar timing noise will be discussed elsewhere.

The loss-cone angle
The lifetime of trapped particles is limited by cyclotron decay and
pitch-angle scattering, both of which violate the first invariant. The electron's
synchrotron cooling time, i.e., the time that it loses half of its energy
(FORMULA ), is FORMULA  with
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the classical radius of the electron
and FORMULA  is the electron cyclotron frequency. Figure REF  shows
a pulsar distribution on FORMULA -FORMULA  with the time (REF ) indicated.
Six examples where FORMULA  is calculated are listed in Table 1. For fast rotating young pulsars
or millisecond pulsars, (REF ) is very short FORMULA ,
and for typical pulsars it can be quite long FORMULA .
Since in the synchrotron regime, the pitch angle remains constant,
the relevant time that constrains particle trapping is
the cooling time in the limit FORMULA ,
FORMULA  {{cite:7daaae32-43e3-4040-ae84-b0da817d5dba}},
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the perpendicular and
parallel components of the particle's dimensionless initial momentum. This gives
FORMULA , which has the following numerical form
FORMULA 
One has FORMULA  if a particle is injected into the trapping
region with a large initial pitch angle FORMULA .
However, one has a much shorter cooling time if the initial pitch angle is small FORMULA .
In the cyclotron regime, the particle radiates at a much slower
rate, relaxing to the ground Landau state on a time
FORMULA .
Equating the cyclotron decay time to the bounce time, one finds the
minimum pitch angle for a particle to be reflected at the mirror point.
This angle is estimated to be
FORMULA 
For particles to remain trapped for time much longer than FORMULA , the pitch
angle at injection needs to be much larger than (REF ).
FIGURE 
Pitch angle scattering by waves can lead to particle diffusion to small pitch angles
and limit the life time of the trapped particles.
Since the decay time decreases rapidly with decreasing altitude according to
FORMULA , particles scattered to small pitch angles can reach low altitudes
rapidly radiating away their perpendicular energy and eventually reach the star.
For example, particles with FORMULA , which are scattered into the loss cone of
FORMULA , can travel down to an altitude FORMULA  where the decay time is only
FORMULA . The sources of the waves can be internal,
i.e., they are generated in situ through plasma instabilities,
or external, i.e., they are generated outside the region.
Since particles with small pitch angles escape through both
ends of the `magnetic bottle', there is an excess of particles with a
large pitch angle; this gives rise to an ideal condition for instabilities to develop (driven by
an inversion in the particle pitch angle distribution).
Waves generated from instabilities can cause pitch angle diffusion,
further enhancing particle precipitation. In principle, this process can
impose an upper limit to the density of the trapped plasma {{cite:cb74501a-a21d-481a-af70-1c92bfe2acf3}}.
However, since the efficiency of pitch-angle scattering depends explicitly on the
wave intensity that in this case is limited to much smaller than the density of
the particle kinetic energy, one needs a relatively high plasma density
for such upper limit to be significant (cf. Sec 5). Alternatively,
pitch-angle scattering can be significant if waves that propagate into
the region can interact with the trapped particles in resonance. This possibility is
discussed in Sec. 5.

Sources for the trapped plasma
Particle loading into the trapping region can be achieved through a process that
is not constrained by the first adiabatic invariant.
We consider two possible sources for the trapped
plasma, both of which involve extrinsic charged particles: (1) pair production
in the trapping region by high-energy gamma rays
emitted by particles accelerated in an outer gap and
(2) direct ionization of neutral material in the thermal radiation field in the CFLR.
Both cases may involve ionization of neutral matter migrating into the magnetosphere
due to accretion of a disk {{cite:61b6ce77-4887-4e5d-a6f1-02ae6ac903c1}}, {{cite:ab41f4c1-ff02-460e-aa86-b34c9026e563}} or neutral dust grains in the ISM {{cite:ec987fc3-2a5e-4618-9f06-59b8014716ed}}.
For (1), the outer gap, which is usually dormant for
typical pulsars, is reignited with the supply of charged particles.
Although the gap is rather inefficient for
pair production, it can lead to a build-up of particles in
the CFLR over a time much longer than the pulsar period (cf. Sec. 4).
For (2), charged particles from the ionization
can be accelerated through either inward (toward the star) cross-field diffusion
or resonant wave-particle interactions, which is similar to
the particle acceleration in the van Allen belts in the Earth's
magnetosphere {{cite:78bae7e6-e651-4f4c-8d53-a5646303d3a0}}.
In principle, high-energy cosmic rays can also inject pairs
into the trapping region. (Note that cosmic rays contribute to trapped
plasmas in the van Allen belts through decay of upward deflected neutrons
produced by high-energy cosmic rays.) For example,
cosmic protons with a gyroradius larger than FORMULA  can drift into the pulsar magnetosphere.
For a typical pulsar, the proton needs to have a Lorentz factor FORMULA ,
where FORMULA  is the proton cyclotron frequency at the LC and FORMULA .
Ultrarelativistic protons produce pairs on the thermal radiation through
FORMULA . However, it can be shown that such mechanism is not
effective. Assuming a typical proton flux density
similar to that received on the Earth, FORMULA  at
FORMULA , one finds a pair injection rate
about FORMULA . It would take
much longer than the Hubble time to fill the magnetosphere
to the GJ density.
FIGURE 

Dormant outer gap
We show that a dormant outer gap can supply pairs to the trapping regions.
It is generally thought an outer gap exists between the null surface
and the boundary surface separating the OFLR and the CFLR
{{cite:75e31b29-b91e-4d5b-86db-d91a86d978cd}}, {{cite:57d9f1ea-6388-4d39-aa78-efc3679659a9}}, {{cite:def79d73-2469-4b6e-b149-ac70ff2d467a}}, {{cite:32ba4039-7408-4b7a-9b17-8595b0e68aad}}, {{cite:1c7bce27-3493-4579-8a41-c29d883f29f3}}. For young, fast rotating pulsars, particle acceleration in
the outer gap can self-sustain a pair cascade, which can transfer a significant fraction of the
gap potential into the secondary particles kinetic energy, which is then radiated at high energies.
As the pulsar period increases, the gap become less efficient in pair production
and thus, for slow pulsars, pair production in the outer gap becomes negligible.
However, provided that there is an external source of particles,
the potential energy of such dormant gap can be tapped and transferred
to plasma kinetic energy trapped in the CFLR.
Acceleration in the outer gap
The accelerating electric field along the field lines in an outer gap can be written as
a fraction of the maximum potential drop FORMULA  across the PC:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is a parameter characterizing the geometry of the gap and
FORMULA . Since pair production can change the gap geometry,
the parameter FORMULA  is usually determined self-consistently by taking into
account the effect on the accelerating potential by pair creation
{{cite:1c7bce27-3493-4579-8a41-c29d883f29f3}}. As we consider
here specifically slowly rotating pulsars, in contrast to rapidly
rotating young pulsars such as the Crab pulsar, pair production
has little effect on the gap electrodynamics and thus, one can treat
FORMULA  as a constant.
Assume that the outer gap is located along the last open field line starting
from the null surface at a radius FORMULA  and consider acceleration
of an electron toward the star. Possible extrinsic sources of charged particles are discussed
in Sec. 3.3. When curvature radiation is the dominant energy loss process,
an assumption used in the usual outer gap models {{cite:75e31b29-b91e-4d5b-86db-d91a86d978cd}}, {{cite:57d9f1ea-6388-4d39-aa78-efc3679659a9}},
the radiation-reaction limited Lorentz factor is
FORMULA 
where FORMULA ,
FORMULA , the curvature radius at FORMULA  is assumed to be
FORMULA ,
and FORMULA  is the classical radius of the electron.
The characteristic energy (in FORMULA ) of curvature photons emitted by these electrons is
FORMULA 
where FORMULA , the approximation
is obtained with FORMULA , and
FORMULA  is the Compton wavelength divided
by FORMULA . One may estimate the pulsar period range where the acceleration is limited
by curvature radiation:
FORMULA 
The probability of a photon being converted to a pair through collision with
thermal photons is tiny, and hence the bulk of curvature photons escape as a
MeV gamma-ray flux with a luminosity
FORMULA . For slowly rotating pulsars this flux may be too low to be detectable.
For pulsars with rotation periods that do not satisfy (REF ),
primary particles may lose energy principally through inverse Compton scattering (ICS)
on thermal radiation from the star's surface. For a surface temperature
FORMULA , the number density of thermal photons
with a characteristic energy FORMULA  is
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .
Since the thermal photons propagate radially, backward moving electrons
undergo head-on scattering on these photons. In the electron rest frame,
the thermal photon energy is FORMULA , implying that
the scattering is in the Klein-Nishina (KN) regime. The energy loss rate is
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  the Thomson cross section.
TABLE 

Pair creation
The only viable channel for pair creation far from the star's surface
is through photon-photon collision. The primary photons can be
produced from curvature radiation or ICS.
First, consider pair production due to curvature radiation.
The number of curvature photons with energy FORMULA  emitted
by a primary electron over a distance FORMULA  is written as
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the thickness (in units of FORMULA ) of the shell region,
FORMULA  is the fine constant and FORMULA  is the modified Bessel function.
The number of curvature photons emitted decreases rapidly with increasing FORMULA .
One has FORMULA  for FORMULA  and
FORMULA  for FORMULA  and FORMULA  for
FORMULA , with FORMULA ,
FORMULA , and FORMULA . The number of pairs per electron produced
near the LC, i.e., the multiplicity denoted by FORMULA , is estimated
as FORMULA  where
FORMULA 
is the cross section of pair production via photon-photon collision.
Since pairs are produced on the Wien tail of the thermal spectrum,
in stead of (REF ), the thermal photon number density is written as
FORMULA ,
where FORMULA 
is the parameter characterizing the Wien tail (FORMULA )
where thermal photons satisfy the pair production threshold,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the angle between the pair-producing gamma-ray and thermal
photon. One has FORMULA  for FORMULA , FORMULA  and
the numbers given in (REF ).
Assuming that (REF ) is satisfied, one obtains
FORMULA 
with FORMULA .
The multiplicity increases rapidly with decreasing pulsar period.
As examples, from Eq (REF ) one obtains
FORMULA  for J1913+1333 with FORMULA  and
FORMULA  for J1819FORMULA 1458 with FORMULA , where FORMULA 
and FORMULA  is assumed.
Pair production due to ICS becomes significant if the curvature photon energy
is too low to satisfy the threshold condition (REF ).
Since the scattered photon energy is FORMULA 
in the KN regime, the production rate of the scattered photons with
energy FORMULA  is FORMULA . The number of photons emitted through ICS over a distance
FORMULA  is
FORMULA 
Similarly, one has FORMULA ,
which takes the following numerical form
FORMULA 
Pair production is strongly dependent on the surface temperature but
insensitive to the pulsar period.
In the outer gap models, the primary particles are assumed to be created
in a pair cascade in the gap {{cite:75e31b29-b91e-4d5b-86db-d91a86d978cd}}, {{cite:57d9f1ea-6388-4d39-aa78-efc3679659a9}} and the primary flux is limited to
a value near the GJ flux. To allow a substantial energy transfer from primaries to pairs,
as this is the case for high-energy pulsars, one must have the pair multiplicity in the vicinity of the
gap to be at least one, i.e., FORMULA , with FORMULA  defining a deathline where the gap becomes inactive.
For parameters appropriate for RRATs and magnetars, one has FORMULA  except for FORMULA .
Thus, one can ignore the feedback effect by pair production on the accelerating
electric field in the gap.

Source of primary particles
Low-level accretion of neutral grains from a dust disk or the ISM can provide
extrinsic charged particles. The accreted neutral material can be ionized inside the
pulsar magnetosphere by the thermal radiation from the star's surface and
particles produced from ionization are then channeled to the outer gap
or trapped in the CFLR. The maximum flux that can be tolerated
in the gap is about the GJ flux FORMULA  with the gap location assumed to be
along the last open field lines starting from the null surface at the radius
FORMULA . It is unlikely that the supply of charged particles
matches exactly the GJ flux and the acceleration may become oscillatory so that the
net flux is maintained at about the GJ level.
For the case of accretion of the ISM dust grains,
the accretion rate is FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the gravitation constant,
FORMULA  is the neutron star's mass,
and FORMULA  is the pulsar velocity, FORMULA  is
the ISM density. Dust grains of small size (FORMULA ) may not survive
sputtering by protons when crossing the bow shock and those with size
FORMULA  have a better chance to reach the LC {{cite:ec987fc3-2a5e-4618-9f06-59b8014716ed}}.
Assuming that flux rate FORMULA  of electrons into the gap is FORMULA  of this flux rate,
one estimates FORMULA . Here we assume
FORMULA  and FORMULA .
One finds this flux is considerably larger than the GJ flux FORMULA .
The accelerating electric field changes sign if the
flux exceeds the GJ flux {{cite:def79d73-2469-4b6e-b149-ac70ff2d467a}}.
Although a divergent solution for FORMULA  is possible {{cite:def79d73-2469-4b6e-b149-ac70ff2d467a}}, here we
assume that the maximum accelerating potential is limited by (REF )
determined by the vacuum potential drop.
For pulsars with FORMULA , the ISM grains may not survive
disintegration {{cite:ec987fc3-2a5e-4618-9f06-59b8014716ed}} and in this case the disk is the main source of
the accreted neutral matter. The disk model was discussed in detail
by {{cite:61b6ce77-4887-4e5d-a6f1-02ae6ac903c1}}. The recent discovery of a fall-back disk
around a magnetar lends support for the existence of such disks
around long-period pulsars.

Particle loading in the CFLR
Despite the slow rate of pair production, a significant number of
particles can be accumulated in the CFLR over a time FORMULA .
A schematic of pair injection by a latent outer gap is shown in Figure REF .
One may estimate the time required for the plasma density to increase to the
GJ density in the trapping region.
Assume a particle flux in the gap is FORMULA .
Acceleration of these particles can inject pairs into the CFLR at a rate
FORMULA  with the gap's cross section area approximated by
FORMULA  (where FORMULA ). A continuous injection of pairs can lead
to build-up of the plasma density in the trapping region. The time
for the density to reach the GJ density FORMULA  is
FORMULA 
We refer to (REF ) as the pair loading time.
Numerical examples of FORMULA  are shown in table 1, where we assume
FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA . The surface
temperature is assumed to be FORMULA  for J1913+1333,
FORMULA  for J1819-1458 {{cite:6267ed07-aa40-47bc-a0ed-7e33cb17945c}} and
FORMULA  for a magnetar. One has
FORMULA  for these three pulsars. For J1317-5759, one finds
FORMULA  for FORMULA , FORMULA  and
FORMULA .
Alternatively, the plasma can be injected near the star through
photon decay in the magnetic field {{cite:b833e49d-fccf-476d-9b53-b70445c19e72}}. Such case was also considered
by {{cite:8b47ea60-65f2-489d-b801-06f20f40aa69}} for
the double pulsar system. In their model, they considered pitch angle increase
due to absorption of the coherent radio waves from the other pulsar in
the system.

Injection through ionization
Radiation belts can form directly through evaporation and
ionization of neutral grains accreted from
a disk or the ISM. One can show that the density of trapped plasmas
can easily exceed the local GJ density with a slow accretion rate.
For example, to accumulate a plasma with the GJ density over a time FORMULA ,
a rate as low as FORMULA  would be sufficient.
The trapped particles can be accelerated to relativistic energy through
either cross field diffusion toward the star or interactions with
waves near the cyclotron resonance. Both processes are believed to be responsible
for particle acceleration in the Earth's van Allen belts where electrons are
accelerated up to 10 MeV energy {{cite:78bae7e6-e651-4f4c-8d53-a5646303d3a0}}.
In the cross field diffusion, extremely low-frequency disturbances (ELFWs)
in resonance with the particle drift frequency (around the star)
can force particles to diffusion across the field lines inward
(toward the star) where the magnetic field increases. Conservation of both
the first adiabatic invariant FORMULA  and the second adiabatic invariant
FORMULA  (bouncing back and forth between two mirror points)
implies an increase in both FORMULA  and FORMULA ;
thus, FORMULA  increases as FORMULA  increases with decreasing
FORMULA  (inward), that is, the particles are accelerated. For the Earth's radiation belts,
ELFWs are generated due to the large scale spatial disturbances
by the solar wind. In the pulsar case, the most plausible candidate for such low
frequency waves is Alfvén waves (cf. Sec. 6).

Stability of the trapped plasma
The pulsar radiation belts have many similarities to planetary radiation belts.
For example, in both cases the stability of the trapped plasma can be strongly
affected by change of the global magnetic field structure, i.e. distortion of the
`magnetic bottle', or strong pitch-angle scattering of particles on waves. For the Earth's van
Allen belts, such activities are due to the disturbances from the solar wind,
while activities in the pulsar radiation belts are powered by the rotational energy
or magnetic energy. In magnetars, strong starquakes can lead to significant distortion of magnetic field lines,
but such major events may not be common for normal pulsars.
Here we only discuss low-level starquakes or neutron star oscillations (cf. Fig REF ), which
can lead to pitch-angle scattering by Alfvén waves generated at the surface.
Pitch-angle scattering
A formal theory for diffusion of particles in momentum space is the quasilinear
diffusion formalism in which the processes arising from a feedback from
growth of linear waves are determined by diffusion coefficients. In momentum space, such diffusion can
be separated into diffusion in pitch angle and in FORMULA . The general formalism is outlined in Appendix
B. Here we consider specifically the pitch angle diffusion coefficient
FORMULA  (cf. Appendix). Quasilinear diffusion occurs effectively through resonant
wave-particle interactions. The most widely-discussed process in the context
of cosmic ray confinement is the scattering due to cyclotron resonance
FORMULA  with FORMULA  {{cite:5f75091d-20a6-4d71-b26c-31c65a78d415}}. In this case,
the wave fluctuations can be regarded as predominantly magnetic and as the zeroth order
approximation in the expansion on FORMULA , the process can
be viewed as elastic scattering of particles by magnetic
fluctuations, causing change of their motion direction.
Since the frequency of waves generated from starquakes {{cite:c5a5ae3f-30c0-4772-92e3-5e1ce6e2e255}} or
stellar oscillations {{cite:e3418120-56cd-4c0c-bb32-6af30128b3ed}} is low, about kHz as compared to
the cyclotron frequency FORMULA , the cyclotron resonance condition is generally not satisfied
except for the cases where these waves can cascade into high-frequency waves,
e.g., through three-wave interactions. Here we only consider
pitch-angle scattering due to the Cerenkov resonance.
Unlike wave-particle interactions in the cyclotron resonance, the Cerenkov resonance
only changes FORMULA  not FORMULA . In general, it leads to an increase
in FORMULA , corresponding to a decreasing pitch angle FORMULA .
There are two relevant low-frequency wave modes: the FORMULA  mode and
the FORMULA , corresponding respectively to the fast mode
and the Alfvén mode in the MHD.
Pitch angle diffusion due to the fast mode waves in Cerenkov resonance was
discussed by {{cite:37e27f15-33ac-4202-baa8-fa6436e84ca7}}. Since there is a nonzero FORMULA  along the mean magnetic field,
fast particles in the Cerenkov resonance bounce back and forth between
two successive magnetic compressions (acting as two magnetic mirrors) in the wave frame. On average,
particles gain energy causing an increase in FORMULA . This process, also called
transit-time damping, works for a low Alfvén speed FORMULA , a condition not satisfied for pulsars.
So, instead we consider a low frequency FORMULA  mode, which we refer to as the Alfvén wave.
In kinetic theory in the limit FORMULA , which is appropriate for pulsar
magnetopheric plasmas, Alfvén waves have a nonzero FORMULA  along the magnetic field
{{cite:97343a58-8e8e-41e7-a8aa-3cbf4402501e}}, {{cite:34f1d5c0-a9fb-4d02-83ab-3c1d02f60af1}} and particles can be accelerated through the
Cerenkov resonance {{cite:69e42867-c0da-4890-98f9-cd512da3ca7e}}.
The scattering time FORMULA  may be
written in terms of the ratio of the magnetic energy density
FORMULA  of the wave to the plasma kinetic
energy density FORMULA  (Appendix)
FORMULA 
Considering a plasma consisting of electrons and positrons,
for FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA , one
estimates FORMULA . One concludes that
diffusion due to particles in Cerenkov resonance
with a low frequency Alfvén wave can effectively
transfer particles to small pitch angles.
It is appropriate to comment here that growth or damping of Alfvén waves through
the Cerenkov resonance is generally not effective because the parallel component of
the wave polarization is rather small, FORMULA .
Thus, quasilinear diffusion as a result of such linear wave growth is not significant, limited
by FORMULA  (cf. Eq. REF ). This has been the main reason
that such two-stage diffusion mechanism is not favored for the interpretation of cosmic-ray propagation, which,
as inferred from observations, is subject to strong-pitch angle scattering in the
ISM {{cite:5f75091d-20a6-4d71-b26c-31c65a78d415}}. However, such limit is not applicable in our case as Alfvén waves are
assumed to be generated externally, not through the Cerenkov resonance, with magnetic
energy density comparable with FORMULA ; thus, efficient diffusion occurs
even for FORMULA .

Precipitation
Disturbances to the radiation belt can be catastrophic if the wave that propagates
to the region is in the form of short bursts producing
FORMULA  in the trapping region. As shown from
(REF ), the scattering time can be as short as seconds.
The requirement of FORMULA  is rather modest.
For example, for FORMULA , one has
FORMULA , giving
a luminosity FORMULA  where FORMULA  is the pulse duration.
As this luminosity is minuscule compared with transient emission in magnetars (typically
FORMULA ), these waves are not significant in producing high-energy emission.
Strong pitch angle diffusion channels most particles into the much smaller
loss cone through which particles can reach a region close to the star
where their synchrotron decay time is short. This can cause a sudden intense
precipitation of particles on a time scale shorter than the pulsar period.
One may estimate the required wave amplitude in terms of magnetic fluctuations
as FORMULA ,
implying low intensity quakes or oscillations would be sufficient for triggering
disruption of the trapped plasma.
If the triggering mechanism is starquakes, the reoccurrence time of such particle storms
is essentially the reoccurrence time of the quakes. The physics of neutron star
quakes or oscillations is not well understood. A possibility is
that a strong toroidal field exists in the crust underneath the surface
and its stress can be released as quakes transfering the magnetic energy to
the magnetosphere in Alfvén waves {{cite:c5a5ae3f-30c0-4772-92e3-5e1ce6e2e255}}, {{cite:39199af1-85fb-4665-a62e-b1a41f04d94a}}. One expects that such starquakes are
relatively more frequent for a high-field, young pulsar. If
generation of low-intensity Alfvén waves is so frequent that
the reoccurrence time is much shorter than the pulsar period, trapped plasmas do not
have enough time to accumulate and radiation belts may not form. This may be the case
for magnetars with active transient emission.
FIGURE 

Application to RRATs
An important consequence of the formation of pulsar radiation belts is
transient emission—radio bursts that can be produced as particles precipitate
and such transient emission may be relevant to RRATs.
Coherent emission
RRATs are bright radio bursts with a flux density up to a few Jy at 1.4 GHz.
As for normal radio pulses, the emission mechanism must be coherent.
Since there is no widely accepted mechanism for the pulsar radio emission,
it is expected that many uncertainties would remain in
identifying the specific emission mechanism for the transient case. Nonetheless,
in the following we consider two possibilities
in particular: two-stream instability and cyclotron/synchrotron maser.
Two-stream instability
The two-stream instability has been discussed extensively
as a possible mechanism for pulsar radio emission, but
the growth rate is not sufficient for the instability to develop in the polar
region, mainly because of the very high Lorentz factor of the primary particle
beam {{cite:f6908fc7-7fef-46ac-a28e-1d1d63819e1e}}. It is shown here that the plasma conditions
created during the particle precipitation is favorable for such an instability to
occur.
Two-stream instability can develop when particles traverse a corotating
background plasma which is assumed to be stationary. Assuming the precipitating
plasma density is FORMULA  times the local GJ density FORMULA  and the spread
in the particle momentum distribution is ignored (this spread can
reduce the growth rate, cf discussion below). Consider
wave growth due to the Cerenkov resonance FORMULA .
The characteristic frequency is determined by the denser plasma.
For FORMULA , the characteristic frequency is the frequency
FORMULA  of the stationary background, corotating plasma, with
the backflowing plasma regarded as a weak beam satisfying
the resonance condition. The growth rate is then estimated to be
FORMULA 
The growth rate reaches maximum at FORMULA  in the limit FORMULA .
For FORMULA , the growth rate can be estimated in the rest frame of the
backflowing plasma assuming that the corotating background plasma is a beam in Cerenkov resonance.
One finds
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the characteristic frequency seen in the
pulsar frame.
Note that for two-stream instability in the polar cap model, the energetic particle
beam is usually identified as those primary particles from the PC, with
a Lorentz factor as high as FORMULA  and instability is strongly suppressed
{{cite:122d9359-1402-4989-8f25-68972a95e028}}, {{cite:f6908fc7-7fef-46ac-a28e-1d1d63819e1e}}. In the model discussed here FORMULA  is about a few and
the growth rate (REF ) or (REF ) can be quite fast.
For FORMULA , FORMULA , (REF ) gives FORMULA .
Although the growth rate can be reduced due to a spread in the
particle momentum distribution, it seems that the instability can develop rapidly.
It should be pointed out here that radio emission from two-stream instability is
a two-stage process. The instability can generate Langmuir
waves which can in turn be converted to electromagnetic waves and at the same time facilitate
the particle precipitation.

Cyclotron/synchrotron maser
Since particles with small pitch angles escape through the loss cone,
particle precipitation creates an inversion in the pitch angle distribution
of the upward flowing particles, driving cyclotron maser {{cite:39d4c3fe-16cc-4c7e-9008-655dc3c3cffd}}, {{cite:6193ca97-f244-46d9-b6f9-9ef050767808}} or synchrotron maser
{{cite:e040c2e0-5d01-4429-8a96-5406a3742487}}, {{cite:3e05f9c7-077e-4b1b-a816-b7cfc70c85d9}}, {{cite:1f84d99b-b2c1-4d74-a961-a1830d1c80a3}}. This mechanism was discussed widely in interpretation of
planetary radio bursts {{cite:72abc34c-aa64-4eda-b9f7-f6f5763d6993}}, {{cite:8d3c263d-0b03-41eb-b244-403e6bb98672}} and solar bursts {{cite:39d4c3fe-16cc-4c7e-9008-655dc3c3cffd}}.
Synchrotron maser is applicable in the relativistic regime
FORMULA , while cyclotron maser may be the more relevant when such inversion occurs close to the star
during the precipitation when their gyration is in the nonrelativistic regime.
The relevant radio wave can grow when the frequency satisfies the cyclotron resonance condition.
For cyclotron resonance at the fundmental harmonic FORMULA ,
the growth rate is given by {{cite:39d4c3fe-16cc-4c7e-9008-655dc3c3cffd}}
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the number density of particles in cyclotron resonance,
and FORMULA  is the velocity of particles in cyclotron resonance. For a typical
pulsar with FORMULA  and FORMULA , this condition can be
satisfied at a radius FORMULA . It is worth noting that the related but different
process—cyclotron instability due to the anomalous doppler effect, which has been considered
in the literature for pulsar radio emission {{cite:fe92c7bc-78c7-41a5-8d5f-16434024e974}}, is not applicable here; it requires
an energetic beam (FORMULA ) of particles that satisfy the anomalous doppler condition.

Beaming properties
Bursts produced from particle precipitation are characterized by sharp spikes.
In the case of two-stream instability, since emission arising from the instability
is confined to a thin shell region in the CFLR near the last open field lines, one expects the beaming direction
of the radio emission to be similar to that of reverse emission in the conventional
polar cap models {{cite:1597895c-8cd3-4d5c-93f9-c2c6e9e75e58}}, {{cite:d0ffca38-62f0-4604-94b4-c49e0c543713}}. Consider a trapping region has
a radial range from FORMULA  to FORMULA . The inward tangent angles at FORMULA  are
respectively given by FORMULA  and FORMULA . One has a conal structure with an
angular thickness as FORMULA  for FORMULA .
For the emission to be in radio, the emission radius has to be FORMULA , giving
FORMULA  for FORMULA . Thus, the model predicts a rather
narrow burst profile. Since particle precipitation and subsequent burst emission
can be highly localized and occurs over a large range of altitudes, such
bursts can appear on a wide range of pulsar phase.
For cyclotron maser, the beam width is FORMULA  {{cite:6193ca97-f244-46d9-b6f9-9ef050767808}};
thus, the maser emission can produce narrow spiky profiles. Since cyclotron maser
emission occurs near particle reflection, the emission is beamed at a large
angle to the field lines. This beaming feature is very different from
the usual relativistic beaming (FORMULA ) along the field lines.
Such unsual beaming feature can be tested observationally
if both bursts and weak emission (i.e., the usual pulsed emission)
can be detected and relative phase between the two components can be determined.

Propagation
Propagation of radio emission in the CFLR is constrained by
induced scattering by electrostatic waves excited by the radio emission
itself {{cite:6ff56464-7796-49f6-baec-66de9ccb5a18}}. Assuming a brightness temperature FORMULA  and a beaming solid angle
FORMULA , one may define a radius of an opaque sphere {{cite:6ff56464-7796-49f6-baec-66de9ccb5a18}},
FORMULA 
such that the wave with a frequency FORMULA  can only propagate outside the
sphere FORMULA . Here we assume that the plasma density in the propagation
path is the local GJ density.
Although FORMULA  is not well constrained, the condition (REF )
is quite robust. For an observed flux density FORMULA  and a pulsar distance FORMULA ,
the brightness temperature times the beaming solid angle can be estimated from
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the distance between the scattering region and the emission region.
In the case of inward emission due to two-stream instability,
(REF ) gives a lower limit to the emission radius; for the
emission to be potentially visible, the emission radius must be FORMULA 
{{cite:6ff56464-7796-49f6-baec-66de9ccb5a18}}.

Conclusions and discussion
We consider possible existence of transient radiation belts in
the magnetospheres of pulsars with low LC magnetic fields. It is suggested
that particle acceleration in latent outer gaps can lead to creation of pairs with
large pitch angles in the CFLRs near the LC where they are trapped due to the
magnetic mirror effect. In the trapping regions where the magnetic fields are weak
(FORMULA ), particles radiate away their perpendicular energy over a time
much longer than a typical pulsar period.
Thus, the plasma density can build up over a synchrotron cooling time, which is much longer than
the pulsar period. Similar to the planetary radiation belts, pulsar radiation belts can be
disrupted due to disturbances of waves propagating into the regions. Catastrophic
disruption of these regions may lead to intense particle precipitation, which in turn
generates radio bursts that can be seen as radio transients. The main triggering mechanism is
scattering of trapped particles into a loss cone as a result of interactions with
waves generated in plasma instabilities in the trapping regions or
Alfvén waves emitted at the surface due to low-intensity starquakes or oscillations.
The plasma that rushes through the background corotating plasma can produce bursts of coherent radio
emission through streaming instability or cylcotron/synchrotron maser. Existence of such
radiation belts, if observationally confirmed, would imply that some of the bursty phenomena
of pulsar radio emission may be due to particle precipitation. In particular, we suggest
that such transient radio emission may be seen as RRATs.
A notable feature of our model, as applied to RRATs, is that in comparison with conventional polar cap models,
the transient emission mechanism considered here is less constrained by the pair production
efficiency; it predicts that pulsars below the `deathline' can
still produce radio bursts. One of the major problems with polar cap models is the low
efficiency of pair production. Most RRATs have long periods and for pulsars with such long periods,
there is insufficient supply of pairs needed for coherent emission. Although an
outer gap can supply additional pairs through acceleration of charged
particles supplied externally {{cite:ec987fc3-2a5e-4618-9f06-59b8014716ed}}, {{cite:ef13c7b4-5319-4199-933c-9fdca639fdf6}}, {{cite:61b6ce77-4887-4e5d-a6f1-02ae6ac903c1}}, the pair production
efficiency is too low to produce a substantial downflow of pairs; the only possible
location for reverse emission in the polar regions is near or in the polar gap
where a downward pair cascade can occur; for example, externally-supplied
particles flush the polar gap resulting in a downward transient pair cascade
followed by quenching of the gap {{cite:61b6ce77-4887-4e5d-a6f1-02ae6ac903c1}}. However, such a scenario would predict
an emission region very close to the star and any reverse emission
may be eclipsed by either the star or a dense plasma near the surface.
In our model, since particle precipitation occurs in the CFLR,
it does not quench the polar gap, allowing
the possibility of observing both burst and normal radio emission.
In application to magnetars with active high-energy transient emission, one expects
low-intensity quakes to occur much more frequently than in normal pulsars {{cite:39199af1-85fb-4665-a62e-b1a41f04d94a}}. Such frequent
disruption may prevent a radiation belt forming in a magnetar magnetosphere, even though
the synchrotron decay time is relatively long near the LC. This scenario seems to be supported
by lack of any detection of RRAT-like radio bursts from the known magnetars.
Although transient radio emission was recently detected from the magnetar
XTE J1810FORMULA 197, polarization study suggests that the emission geometry
resembles that of young pulsars {{cite:167c632a-e4e5-4a70-a941-2d96282e68c1}}.
In principle, our model may also apply to old, long-period pulsars. The
loading time FORMULA  can be significantly longer than the synchrotron decay time.
The plasma trapping can be due to in situ ionization of the accreted neutral grains
in the CFLR. Since the synchrotron decay time is long, for example, FORMULA 
for PSR J2144FORMULA 3933 with FORMULA  and FORMULA , a nearby long-period pulsar,
accumulation of plasma can occur over a long time (provided that the reoccurrence time
of the triggering mechanism is also long). Since old pulsars are not energetic,
the predicted radio luminosity is low. As it takes a long time to replenish the trapped plasma, such
transient events can be rather infrequent but may still be detectable provided
these pulsars are located relatively nearby.

Bouncing time
From the first adiabatic invariant FORMULA  and the energy conservation
FORMULA , one has
FORMULA 
where the relevant quantities are functions of FORMULA .
Assuming FORMULA , the time to travel
from the injection radius FORMULA  to the reflection radius FORMULA  and back to FORMULA 
can be written in terms of integration along the particle's path FORMULA :
FORMULA 
where we assume a particle follows the last closed field line of a dipole field and
FORMULA  satisfies the condition FORMULA .
The integration yields approximately FORMULA .
One may assume without loss
of generality FORMULA  to show that the bounce time (back and forth between two mirror points)
is FORMULA . The bounce time is not sensitive to
the pitch angle at the injection provided that the condition FORMULA  is
satisfied; this condition requires the reflection radius to be larger
than the stellar radius, FORMULA .

Pitch-angle scattering
We outline quasilinear theory for pitch-angle scattering. Let
FORMULA  be a gyrophase-averaged distribution in the particle
momentum space. In the quasilinear diffusion formalism one has
FORMULA 
where the diffusion coefficients are written in terms of the scattering
probability FORMULA  and the wave occupation number FORMULA  {{cite:5f75091d-20a6-4d71-b26c-31c65a78d415}}:
FORMULA 
with FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA . The scattering probability is
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  for positrons and FORMULA  for electrons,
FORMULA  is the ratio of the electric to total wave energy density,
FORMULA  and FORMULA .
In the following we consider the small FORMULA  limit.
The Bessel function has an approximation
FORMULA  for FORMULA . This gives
FORMULA  and FORMULA .
The polarization of a low-frequency Alfvén wave can be written as
FORMULA 
where FORMULA

It can easily be verified that FORMULA  for FORMULA .
Assuming FORMULA  and FORMULA , one obtains
FORMULA 
The diffusion coefficient is
FORMULA 
where FORMULA ,
FORMULA  is the magnetic energy density of
the wave concerned, and FORMULA  is the
density of the plasma kinetic energy. It should be emphasized here that the disffusion
in pitch angle is caused by change in FORMULA  not FORMULA .
