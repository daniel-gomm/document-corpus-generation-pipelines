We give all exact solutions of the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Field
Equations coupled with a scalar field in four dimensions under
certain assumptions. The main assumption we make in this work is
to take the second covariant derivative of the coupling function
proportional to the spacetime metric tensor. Although this
assumption simplifies the field equations considerably, to obtain
exact solutions we assume also that the spacetime metric is
conformally flat. Then we obtain a class of exact solutions.
Recently there is an increasing interest in the Gauss-Bonnet
theory with a scalar field to look for possible theoretical
explanation to some cosmological problems such as acceleration of
the universe {{cite:6263e527-c490-4c30-8842-5ddddf7d8c90}}. Accelerated cosmological solutions were
first suggested in {{cite:21c115d4-96b3-4669-ac78-0c45f73eea21}}, {{cite:5d7d60ed-3183-46de-accb-f1f1823653f1}} and also discussed
in {{cite:fa3ab783-0c8a-4b40-932a-7b81746b57c1}}, {{cite:5ce689b6-93f4-4233-b52e-39783f9ecf10}}. It is also expected that this
theory or its modifications may have some contributions to some
astrophysical phenomena. For this purpose, spherically symmetric
solutions of this theory were first studied in {{cite:d288a322-1690-42b6-b41e-a3d0440e0856}},
{{cite:5b8ff11b-42a3-4348-8a0c-184acad254e9}}. It has been observed that the Post-Newtonian
approximation does not give any new contribution in addition to
the post-Newtonian parameters of the general relativity
{{cite:403f1159-6981-4dc4-8ecb-4a46a922fcc3}}. Black hole solutions in the framework of the GB
gravity are investigated recently in {{cite:e85d636a-3520-4ac1-98b8-f08f97bac421}} (see also
{{cite:1d040266-c35e-42a8-aee7-9e369e9aeb55}}, {{cite:0cede35d-2e3c-475f-b57d-ec3d6540c31c}}). There are also attempts to find exact
solutions and to study the stability of the Gauss-Bonnet theory in
various dimensions with actions containing higher derivative
scalar field couplings {{cite:f90c9e68-9d44-476b-a81e-757c3e32b8a3}}, {{cite:1dedacc2-f318-4a4e-ac68-da886821532f}}, {{cite:4ef9b4bb-accd-4b93-86c4-56bcbd285941}}.
Since the Gauss-Bonnet term is a topological invariant in four
dimensions it does not contribute to the Einstein field
equations. On the other hand it contributes to the field equations
if it couples to a spin-0 zero field. In this work we consider a
four dimensional action containing the Einstein-Hilbert part,
massless scalar field and the Gauss-Bonnet term coupled with the
scalar field. The corresponding action is given by {{cite:403f1159-6981-4dc4-8ecb-4a46a922fcc3}}
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  (FORMULA ) and
FORMULA 
and FORMULA  is an arbitrary function of the scalar filed FORMULA 
(coupling function). Here FORMULA  is potential term for the scalar
field. The field equations are given by
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
Einstein field equations are usually solved under certain
assumptions like spherical symmetry, plane symmetry and axial
symmetry. In some cases we assume a form for the spacetime metric
like conformally flat, Kerr-Schild and Gödel types. In each
one we create a class of exact solutions of Einstein's field
equations {{cite:0dabbded-32d6-4f1f-849c-6095c16b6873}}. In this work our intention is open such a
direction in GB theory and obtain exact solutions of this theory
and its modifications under certain assumptions. To this end we
now assume the spacetime geometry FORMULA  is such that (assumption 1)
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are scalar functions and
FORMULA  is a vector field. In the sequel we will assume that
FORMULA  (assumption 2). Eq.(REF ) restricts
the space-time FORMULA . Among these space-times admitting
(REF ) we have conformally flat space-times (assumption
3).
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is a scalar function. In such space-times the
conformal tensor vanishes identically. Hence
FORMULA 
Then the field equations (REF ) reduce to
FORMULA 
We have now the last assumption: All functions depend on
FORMULA  where FORMULA  is a constant vector,
FORMULA . Then from (REF ) we get
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is an arbitrary constant and FORMULA . By using (REF ) and the Ricci tensor
FORMULA 
for the metric (REF ) we obtain the following equations
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
and a dot over a letter denotes derivative with respect to the
scalar field FORMULA . Eqs(REF ) and () give
coupled ODEs for the functions FORMULA  and FORMULA . Letting
FORMULA  and FORMULA  then these equations
become
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is given by (from ())
FORMULA 
Inserting FORMULA  from (REF ) into Eq. () (and using
(REF ) in ()) we obtain simply
FORMULA 
Hence we have the following solutions.

(A)   FORMULA : This corresponds to pure Einstein field
equations with a massless scalar field. The effect of the Gauss
Bonnet term disappears. Solutions of these field equations have
been given in {{cite:9926d3ba-c8e1-4d9e-9e35-bff6ce90c669}}

(B)   FORMULA : The vector field FORMULA  is null. Then
the only field equation is
FORMULA 
and FORMULA  becomes zero. There is a single equation for the two
fields FORMULA  and FORMULA . This means that, if one of the fields FORMULA  or
FORMULA  is given then the other one is determined directly. The metric
takes the form
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are null coordinates and
FORMULA  and the above equation (REF )
becomes
FORMULA 
and the Einstein tensor represents a null fluid with zero
pressure.
FORMULA 
Although the coupling function FORMULA  is nonzero the effect of the GB
term is absent in this type. Such a class of solutions belongs to
class (A).

(C) FORMULA : The vector field FORMULA  is non-null.
Then FORMULA  a real constant which leads to the following solution.
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are arbitrary constants and
FORMULA 
where FORMULA . The potential function FORMULA  takes the form
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and coupling function FORMULA  takes
the form
FORMULA 
The solution we obtained here is free of singularities but not
asymptotically flat. On the other hand, by using this solution it
is possible to obtain an asymptotically flat cosmological
solution.

This solution is well understood in a new coordinate chart
FORMULA  where the line element takes the following form (after
a scaling)
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is a nonzero constant. If FORMULA  is a spacelike
coordinate then FORMULA  and Latin indices take values
FORMULA . If FORMULA  is a timelike coordinate then FORMULA  and
Latin indices take values FORMULA . FORMULA  is the metric of
the flat three dimensional geometry orthogonal to the
FORMULA -direction. The Ricci tensor of the four dimensional metric
FORMULA 
Hence the solution takes the form
FORMULA 
where FORMULA ,  FORMULA  a constant, and
FORMULA  , FORMULA  is an arbitrary
constant. The curvature scalars are given by
FORMULA 
and the Gauss-Bonnet scalar density FORMULA . It clear that FORMULA  is
the spacetime singularity. Letting
FORMULA , the Einstein tensor becomes
FORMULA 
This tensor has a physical meaning when FORMULA  in which
case the Gauss-Bonnet gravity produces a singular cosmological
model. The Einstein tensor represents a perfect fluid with an
energy density FORMULA  and a negative pressure FORMULA .
Both of them are singular at FORMULA .

We have found the most general solutions of the Gauss-Bonnet
gravity coupled to a scalar field under the assumptions stated in
the text. One solution (B) depends on a null coordinate whose
Einstein tensor corresponds to the energy momentum tensor of a
null fluid with zero pressure. The other solution (C) depends on
variable FORMULA  whose curvature invariants are all singular at FORMULA .
When FORMULA  represents the time coordinate then GB gravity gives a
cosmological model with a negative pressure. The solution is
singular on the 3-surface FORMULA .
We would like to conclude with a remark. The field equations
(REF ) and (REF ) of the GB theory with a scalar field
resemble to the field equations of the modified Gauss-Bonnet
theory {{cite:6263e527-c490-4c30-8842-5ddddf7d8c90}}, {{cite:030714b2-f8b0-4e53-ae49-85999418bce2}}. In the latter case the scalar
field FORMULA  and the potential term FORMULA  are absent in the
action and the function FORMULA  depends on the GB term
(REF ). We remark that the flat metric is the only solution
of the modified Gauss-Bonnet field equations under the assumptions
made in the text. It seems that scalar field is crucial to obtain
non-flat metrics. It is however interesting to search for the
solutions of the modified GB field equations. For this purpose we
are planning to relax our assumptions 2 and 3 in a forthcoming
publication.
